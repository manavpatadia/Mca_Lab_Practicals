0,Star Wars,A New Hope,76759,"[""I couldn't have asked for anything more. Star Wars: A New Hope had it all. If I had to sum it up in one word, superlative would be my answer. I saw the film for the first time three months ago and loved it, and since then I have watched all the Star Wars movies. I was disappointed with the prequels (Attack of the Clones was my least favourite), but this, Return of the Jedi and Empire Strikes Back were perfection.I have to say that the film looks absolutely amazing even after thirty plus years, with highly imaginative sets and dazzling special effects. And the action sequences were superbly choreographed and brisk, the Death Star climax was a knockout. The music by John Williams is absolutely outstanding, by far one of his more exciting and rousing scores. The story is fast-paced, intelligent and has an essence of sophistication, and the screenplay is sharp and decisive.And the performances were flawless. In the prequels I had problems relating to some of the performers, namely Hayden Christensen as Anakin. Here, all the actors played their parts with superlative skill. Alec Guiness, one fine actor and will be sorely missed was a standout, likewise with Peter Cushing and Harrison Ford(hilarious here). Carrie Fisher was a fine Princess Leia, spunky, beautiful and sexy, and Mark Hamill was a completely likable Luke. And the villain Darth Vader, without doubt one of the best and in-depth villains in cinematic history, and James Earl Jones's deep booming voice was perfect for the character.All in all, a definite sci-fi classic, that blew me away. 10/10 Bethany Cox"", ""The awesome special effects and the creation of creatures that are part of the vivid imagination of George Lucas are not the reason for the enduring popularity of Star Wars and the franchise it spawned. Rather it is because of the characters Lucas created that will live as long as we have cinema and the means to display it.The spectacle is behind some real, but simple people. No shadings of gray in the first Star Wars we know without any doubt who the heroes and villains are of this piece. On an isolated planet a galaxy wide dictatorship called the Empire and the revolt against come to wear young Luke Skywalker as played by Mark Hamill and his family reside. So does Alec Guinness, a reclusive and mysterious hermit. An escape pod crashes there with two androids, C3PO and R2D2 and in the latter is a message for Guinness who was at one time a Jedi Knight, fiercest of a warrior class, from Carrie Fisher playing Princess Leia. Also in R2D2 are the schematics for the Empire's ultimate weapon the satellite size death star that can deal killing out on a planetary scale. This starts an adventure with young Hamill who teams up with futuristic soldier of fortune Harrison Ford as Han Solo and his simian like sidekick Chewbacca to rescue the Princess and defeat the Death Star.Those are the good guys. The bad guys are the blackest of black villainy. Peter Cushing cold bloodedly commands the Death Star, but the mysterious Darth Vader, clad in black with a helmet completely covering his head, has mysterious powers and even his superiors are wary of him. The voice of James Earl Jones is unforgettable as the black prince of the galaxy.These are characters that bring out the kid in all of us. The ones who claim the most sophistication in their lives will cheer on for Hamill and Ford and will be fascinated by the double dyed villainy of Darth Vader.Perhaps the most interesting aspect of Star Wars and I speak now of all the films is the way such non-humans as the robots and Chewbacca the Wookie became characters. C3PO had dialog, but R2D2 had a few clicks and bleeks and all Chewbacca did was grunt, still they became as identifiable as the human characters.Star Wars set the standard for science fiction films to come for the next several generations. It was given six Oscars in a bunch of technical categories and it's got a re-release value that Gone With The Wind used to have.The Force Will Be With Us Always."", 'Okay, so as a kid this was one of my favourite films. But as you grow up things change and on second viewing, I found this film to be surprisingly slow in places and actually comes close to outstaying its welcome towards the end. These aren\'t big flaws, mind you, but ones which niggle at me and make me feel as if I\'m betraying a universal dream in some way. The truth is that I far prefer the second and third entries in this series, as they don\'t have to go through the troubles of introducing all the characters, and instead can simply continue the action at a fast speed.There are many good things about this film to make it worthwhile, though. This is one of those movies with a comic book feel to it which can appeal to adults and children alike. There\'s a sufficiently \'epic\' nature to the film, in that a whole other universe has been created and we are merely viewing a part of what happens in it. There\'s plenty of action, ranging from the traditional light-saber fights to some exciting space skirmishes. The huge budget allows for many, many different special effects. Some of these look a little ropey today but they\'re all infinitely superior to the overblown, laughable CGI antics in THE PHANTOM MENACE, where all touch with reality was lost.The characters are likable and clear-cut; you\'ve got heroic heroes and evil villains. Mark Hamill is fine as Luke Skywalker, although it\'s sad that he never achieved success in any other movies NOT in the STAR WARS series. Harrison Ford provides a clean, charismatic action man in Han Solo. Carrie Fisher is pretty and funny as Princess Leia, and Alec Guinness lends heavyweight support to the whole affair with his Obi-Wan Kenobi. The only downside to the cast are the inclusion of the robots C3P0 and R2-D2 and Chewie, who are, seen today in an adult light, pretty irritating, it has to be said. But for kids, they\'re funny.The villains always tend to be the best guys in these films and this is no exception. Darth Vader is THE king of cool, and I always wanted to be him when I was younger. It\'s strange to think how strongman Dave Prowse when from being the monster in Hammer\'s lame HORROR OF FRANKENSTEIN to becoming one of the biggest screen villains of all time. One also mustn\'t forget the contribution of Peter Cushing in what was his most popular movie; he lends gravity to the movie and is excellent as the icy commander of the Death Star, mainly through his voice alone.Although this is a long film, the action is split up across a number of different planets in order to make it more interesting. There are laser battles, lots of shooting, brief gore (an arm-lopping), and all manner of weird and wonderful rubbery alien creatures to make it enjoyable. I especially loved the scene in the garbage disposal unit which uses the old ""closing walls"" routine on our heroes to great effect. This is a deservedly famous movie which kick-started a whole new mythos, brought a legion of movie nerd fans together and harked back to the great days of the sci-fi serials of the late \'30s and \'40s. Not the best of the series, but pretty darned good going.', 'Star Wars (1977) **** (out of 4) Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) joins forces with Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) as they plan to go after Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) who is being held hostage by Darth Vadar.Whether people like it or not, STAR WARS is one of those ground-breaking movies that became a massive hit and it eventually took over the world. Watching the film so many years later it really is amazing what George Lucas was able to do with this film and what would follow. I will gladly admit that I\'m not a fanboy of this series and in fact this recent viewing was the first time I had seen this since it was released in its Special Edition form. With that said, even though I\'m not a ""fanboy"" it\'s impossible to deny that power that this film contains.Storywise there\'s really nothing overly ground-breaking here but in my opinion that\'s what makes the film so darn good. There\'s no long-winded or drawn-out story to drag things down. The basic premise is rather simple as an up-and-coming fighter gets his opportunity to be great and sets out to do so. I think this simple story makes the characters stand out all the better because it really gives them a chance to shine and come to life. It certainly also helps that Lucas was clearly a fan of those cliffhangers from previous decades because he knows how to build up scenes and milk them for everything they\'re worth.It\'s really hard to say anything fresh or new about this film but watching this first one it\'s easy to see why people like Hamill and Fisher became iconic in these parts. Both are quite good in the film as are Alec Guinness and Peter Cushing, the two veterans of the picture. With that said, I think it goes without saying that it\'s Harrison Ford who really stands out in the role of Han Solo. His comic timing with Chewbacca has made for some of the most memorable moments of this film and he\'s simply delightful to watch in the role.Of course, fans will debate the tinkering that Lucas has done with the picture but I think both versions hold up extremely well. I understand the purist who want to view what they originally saw in theaters and I understand those who defend the updating of the effects. Either way, STAR WARS is a rare blockbuster that also manages to be extremely well-made and deserving of its reputation.', 'This story happened \'A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away\'. The galaxy is under the dictatorship of the emperor. Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) is part of the rebellion but is capture by the evil Darth Vader. Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) the young hero, Han Solo (Harrison Ford) the brigand, his sidekick Chewbacca, and the wise master Jedi Ben Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) must together rescue the princess and save the galaxy.The characters are icons pulled from classic storytelling like Akira Kurosawa\'s ""The Hidden Fortress"". George Lucas was able to assemble such iconic characters into a well told story. Rarely is a movie change the nature of movie-making, and even the wider culture. This may be on the list of the most important movie ever. It changed the tone of movies from the gritty morally-confused 70s to the popcorn selling blockbusters that are soon to come.', 'I will never forget the hoopla associated with this movie. Having seen articles in Time and Newsweek, my friend and I took off early from work and made our way to the one theater in the Minneapolis Metro area that was showing ""Star Wars"" (boy have times changed!). There were local news stations, reporters, models, everywhere.  How we were able to just walk to the window and purchase tickets, I don\'t know, but we did. I still have my blue button with ""May the Force be With You"" emblazoned on it. I\'m told it\'s pretty valuable. A reporter approached us and asked my friend, ""What do you expect."" He responded in his sort of wise ass way, ""A sprawling intergalactic epic.""That was all very interesting, but when we finally sat down and the movie began, I found it was less than I had hoped for. Part of my problem was that at that time, most of what I read was science fiction. As I watched the events unfold, I realized that this movie wasn\'t really science fiction--it was a Western. It was the good guy versus the bad guy and an effort to save the old ranch that the bad guys have pillaged. Take out the awesome special effects and the cool aliens and it just wasn\'t very interesting. I realize that most of the people that have seen this consider it just slightly below the second coming--nearly a religious experience--but it wasn\'t for me. I saw nothing new or complex about the character or the themes in the movie. As far as speculative science fiction it is barren. Don\'t get me wrong, I still think that there are amazing things to watch, but I can\'t get past the fact that the storm troopers can\'t hit the broad side of a barn with laser weapons but the good guys can pick off about a dozen from behind a post. Where did these guys get their training? How has the Empire survived so long with these incompetents. Having read ""Dune"" years before this film came out, I have to be brutally honest--how George Lucas didn\'t get sued for stealing from that book, I\'ll never know. I always wondered if he made a deal with Frank Herbert.The worlds are exotic. The aliens are wonderful (although, I thought the second and third movies were much better), especially that bar scene. But the bottom line is that it\'s an adventure movie. Maybe someday someone will convince me otherwise (I have had about 50 people try). If I\'m going to watch a Western, I prefer the Earps and Doc Holliday.', ""first stone for a pop culture monument. not impressive. but nice and useful for its profound innocence. an old fashion Star Wars, full of secrets, naive like its heroes, mixture of Medieval stories and Sci Fi, mirror for teenager 's ambitions, dreams and fantasies, proposing interesting characters and fight scenes who seems be more than fireworks. the fight between Good and Evil. start of a legend. and beautiful slices of humor in different forms. a film who preserves the emotion and fascination of its first public. and, sure, the crazy risks for George Lukas. story of three heroes and exotic in admirable manner, it is always fresh. or, maybe, evergreen. for the small details, for the acting - Han Solo could be different? Luke Skywalker is not the best image of the boy from each from us ? and maybe, as more than piece from large puzzle, a wonderful story about courage. and about Force."", '""Star Wars"" is a 2-hour science fiction movie from almost 30 years ago written and directed by George Lucas. There really needs nothing to be said about how good this is for a 1970s movie, especially in terms of technical aspects. The Academy certainly got it right by giving them all these Oscars for it. However, it lacks in certain other areas unfortunately. First of all, the acting isn\'t too great. That is not really a problem of the characters though, but rather of the way they were written, which simply offered no room for outstanding performances. And Peter Cushing\'s character was downright forgettable despite being the main antagonist. Instead people remember Darth Vader obviously. Why? Because this film is all about the way the characters look and not what they do or say. A bit style over substance. Apart from that, I am quite surprised Alec Guinness scored an Academy Award nomination for his turn here.The script is not the greatest achievement in general. It\'s the usual black-and-white characterization with good vs evil and the characters have no real shades, no facets. This was made up again by the strong work in other departments as it\'s not too memorable what they say and do, but what they look like, especially the non-human characters who are all somewhat considered legendary today. I am not saying the characters are written badly. Not at all. But it\'s just other contributions that made them what they are today. Not the script. And while I enjoyed most of the film, I cannot see it as an epic or a cult classic as so many people do to this date. ""Star Wars"" is bound to rise again with the new film coming out soon and featuring the original cast again. It should be interesting what they make out of it. Until then, feel free to watch the old films like this one, but not too many. The very first Star Wars film here is not a great achievement in terms of story, only in terms of all visual and audible aspects.', 'During the attack of the Empire\'s forces under the command of Darth Vader (David Prowse) to her spacecraft, the rebel Princess Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) hides in the memory of R2-D2 the plans of the powerful Empire\'s Station Death Star that spies from the Rebel Alliance have stolen. She assigns the droid to deliver the plans to Obi-Wan Kenobi with a message to give the plans to the rebels. R2-D2 flees to the Planet Tatooine with his fellow C-3PO in a space pod and land on the desert, but they are captured by Jawa traders. They are sold to Owen Lars (Phil Brown) and when his nephew Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is cleaning the droid, he accidentally activates part of the message and he wonders whether it would be addressed to the old Ben Kenobi. On the next morning, Luke discovers that R2-D2 is seeking out Obi-Wan Kenobi and he goes after him with C-3PO. They are attacked by the Tusken Raiders and saved by a drifter, who is Ben Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) that tells part of his past as Jedi to Luke. He also tells that his father was a Jedi Knight and gives a light-saber that belonged to his father to Luke. Obi-Wan invites Luke to travel with him to Alderaan and when he finds that his family was killed by the Imperial soldiers, he decides to join Obi-Wan in his quest. They head to Mos Esley to hire a skilled pilot and they team-up with the smugglers Han-Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew). Meanwhile the evil Grand Moff Tarkin (Peter Cushing) orders to destroy the planet Alderaan to show the power of the Death Star to Leia and the rebels. Obi-Wan feels the impact in the Force and when the Millennium Falcon arrives at the destination, the group finds only debris. Further, a tractor beam pulls the spacecraft to the Death Star. What will happen to the group and Princess Leia? Will they succeed in delivering the information to the rebels?""Star Wars"", later retitled ""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"" is the unforgettable and charming sci-fi adventure that surprised the world in 1977. The strategy of George Lucas that claimed that there was no technology available to the cinema industry in 1977 to produce the three first chapters was part of a marketing strategy that kept alive the interest of fans fro the whole six chapters, In sequence, great part of the mystery would not have raised. All the films are engaging, but none of them can beat this one rated #19 in IMDb. Harrison Ford in the top of his career and the cast show a wonderful chemistry. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Star Wars: Episódio IV – Uma Nova Esperança"" (Blu-Ray) (""Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope"")', ""The Republic has fallen and the Empire rules the galaxy as a dictatorship, seeking to destroy dissenting voices. The Empire's ultimate weapon, the Death Star, is fully on line and capable of destroying whole systems. The Jedi have been destroyed, save a few living in hiding, unable to compete with the force of the Empire. However Princess Leia has the plans showing a weakness within the Death Star. Before she is captured by Darth Vader she gives them to droids C3PO and R2D2 and they escape. When they land on a nearby planet they find Luke Skywalker and set out to find the owner of the droids Obi Wan Kenobi, or Old Ben Kenobi. Obi Wan begins to train Luke in the way of the force as they try to get the information to the Rebellion before the Death Star can be used at full power.It's not a brilliant piece of filmmaking \x96 lets be honest, Lucas isn't the Shakespeare of our generation. However what it is, is a good story of good v's evil, a western of goodies v baddies set in space. The story is simple but contains clear characters. The thing that sets it apart is the fun \x96 the sense of wonder for kids but also the enjoyment it brings to adult. The story is good for a sci-fi with a lot of history and back-story clearly set out up front. The action scenes are mostly great \x96 not dry effects but with a real sense of action and excitement too.This may be the 4th part but it's also our first chapter, it is light and enjoyable but hints that this is only part of an ongoing battle. The way it relates to kids and adults is obvious as it broke records and everyone of a certain age knows about Star Wars! The effects still look good today \x96 in many ways the model work looks better than all digital effects simply because they are `real' and don't just exist within a computer. Sound effects, comedy, music \x96 it's all pitch perfect and sets up the rest of the series really well.Hamil is ok as Skywalker (`Blonde hair, blue eyes' \x96 Chasing Amy!). He is suitable for a kids film and he does well with his role. However like part 1 has Anakin at his least interesting, part 4 has Luke yet to develop into darker areas. Ford is perfect as Han Solo \x96 he adds character and flair to some dry performances. Alec Guinness adds maturity to the whole film and is so good is Obi Wan that even Ewan McGregor just does an impression rather than recreate the role. Darth Vader is just the right side of silly camp villain, Jones' voice is a perfect fit and he has real menace and power. Bits players such as Chewie, C3PO, R2D2 etc all add comedy in spades.Overall this film is even better now that we know how it all fits together in Star Wars `history'. But even without all the hype this is a really fun sci-fi that is enjoyable, simple and really good fun to watch if you're in the mood. Having a deeper perspective on it just makes it all the better."", 'I couldn\'t let the thirtieth anniversary season of ""Star Wars"" slip by without a commemorative viewing today to remind me of the start of this hugely successful franchise. Though it\'s not one of my own personal Top Ten films of all time, I can understand how so many fans come to see it that way. At the time it was a seminal film that reinvigorated the sci-fi genre; my first viewing when it debuted in theaters garnered more than a single \'Whoa\' with each new scene and concept that hadn\'t been done before. I was particularly intrigued with the names of the characters George Lucas created for his heroes, sounding uniquely original and matching their physical description and characters. Could Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, or Princess Leia have been called anything else? How about Jabba the Hutt; he looks exactly how a Jabba the Hutt would look if there was a Jabba the Hutt. Makes sense, doesn\'t it? I get a kick out of the nay sayers on this board who have such a fierce guttural reaction to the success of the entire Star Wars franchise, never missing an opportunity to thrash it unmercifully. The best response to that I guess would be that they represent a mere six and a half per cent minority of the IMDb voting history for this film that give it less than a 6.0 rating. It reminds me of that joke about the one in three people who might be crazy, and your two best friends seem alright. Something to think about.Anyway, there\'s no point in detailing the film since virtually every one on the planet has probably seen it at least once, even my wife. My son, who was born in 1977, has probably seen it thirty times a year every year since he started watching movies, kind of a record in itself I would think, allowing him to quote virtually every line of dialog from the movie. Such is the compelling nature of true Star Wars fans, who while watching, find themselves in a galaxy far, far away.', 'Well, everyone knows ""Star Wars"": a long, long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Han Solo (Harrison Ford) battle Darth Vader\'s evil forces. Obviously, this is probably one of the top five most famous movies of all time, and it has truly withstood the test of time. It doesn\'t suffice to call ""Star Wars"" a sci-fi, a fantasy, or anything really; it is everything that a movie could be. Looking back on it, we notice that it was actually pretty low tech (which is part of why ""Episode 1"" was so bad).Well anyway, the point is that George Lucas created the ultimate masterpiece here. This movie will live on forever.', 'This is where it all started, the original trilogy and saga of science-fiction epic adventures, from Oscar and Golden Globe nominated writer/director/creator George Lucas. ""A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away"" the universe in ruled in fear by the Empire, and a new threat has been completed, the Death Star battle station. The rebels however have managed to capture the plans for the station, and Senator Princess Leia Organa (introducing Carrie Fisher) places them into the memory of droid R2-D2 (Kenny Baker). R2 with companion droid C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) escape the ship and land the desert world Tatooine, the Princess meanwhile is held captive by the Emperor\'s trusted servant Darth Vader (acted by David Prowse, voiced by James Earl Jones) and battle station leader Grand Moff Tarkin (Peter Cushing). R2 and 3PO meanwhile eventually end up with farm boy Luke Skywalker (introducing Mark Hamill) who lives on the planet with his Aunt and Uncle. While cleaning R2, he comes across the message from the Princess, mentioning Obi-Won Kenobi (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Sir Alec Guinness), an former Jedi Knight who they find in the desert. After his relatives are killed, Luke wants to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi. They contract pilots of the Millennium Falcon, Han Solo (introducing Harrison Ford) and Wookie Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) to take them across the galaxy at light speeds. They travel to what was the Princess\'s planet, Alderaan, but they are pulled in by tracker beam by what destroyed it, the Death Star. After avoiding the stormtroopers, and rescuing the Princess, they eventually escape after removing the beam, but Obi-Won was killed (and became one with the Force) after being killed by his former pupil, Vader. The concluding scenes are the craft and laser battles with the Rebels and the Empire, Darth Vader escapes (giving way to the sequel), and Luke eventually blows up the Death Star (with a great explosion), and the heroes are rewarded, a happy ending. It won the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Costume Design, Best Visual Effects, Best Film Editing, Best Music for John Williams and Best Sound, and it was nominated for Best Picture, Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen and a Special Achievement Award (for creation of alien, creature and robot voices), it won the BAFTAs for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music and Best Sound, and it was nominated for Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing, Best Production Design/Art Direction and Best Film, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Original Score, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture - Drama.

Outstanding!', 'When I first watched this in the cinema I was ten, it was 1977 and I\'d never seen anything like it. It had me gripped from the start when a small spacecraft flew past being fired upon by another much larger one that was so big that it seemed to take ages to pass over the viewer. Unlike the recent prequels scenes such as this weren\'t cluttered with excessive CGI activity but instead showed what was needed in a way that hadn\'t been seen before. The special effects used throughout the film were ground-breaking for the time and still look great to this day, there is something more real looking about the models used when compared to today\'s CGI.The main character are all interesting and likable and the acting was all pretty good both from veteran actors like Alec Guinness and Peter Cushing who brought a suitable gravitas to the film and from younger actors Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher who brought a sense of youthful energy.In the unlikely event that somebody doesn\'t know what the film is about I\'ll give a brief synopsis; Set in a distant galaxy the forces of the evil galactic empire are hunting down the rebels who are attempting to restore the old republic. They are about to capture a rebel ship which has the stolen plans to the empires latest weapon, the Death Star, when they are hidden in a small robot (droid) by the name of R2-D2 by Princess Leah, he escapes in one of the ships escape pods along with his companion C3PO. They escape to the desert world of Tatooine where they are swiftly captured by strange creatures called Jawas who sell the pair to a farmer who gets his nephew Luke to clean them. While doing so he stumbles across a holographic message addressed to one Obi-Wan Kenobi. While Luke is off having his dinner R2-D2 escapes seeking Obi Wan.The next day Luke sets off to find him but shortly after doing so he is ambushed by Sand People who start ransacking his vehicle till they are disturbed by a robed figure who turns out to be Obi-Wan. He explains to Luke that he was once a Jedi knight and friend of his late father who had been killed by another Jedi called Darth Vader who had turned to the dark side of the force, they also see the full message that R2 is carrying which requests that Obi-Wan takes R2 to the planet Alderaan to get the plans to the rebels. While this is happening Vader who is on the ship searching for the plans dispatches troops to search for the two missing droids. By the time Luke returns home it is too late, the place is a burn out ruin and his aunt and uncle are dead. He decides that he will join Obi-Wan on his mission to Alderaan.They hire a ship, called the Millennium Falcon, from a smuggler called Han Solo who needs the money to pay off a debt and avoid the various bounty hunter who are after him. When they arrive at Alderaan they find it is no longer there, it has in fact been destroyed by the Death Star in an attempt to get Princess Leah to tell them where the rebels are based. Soon after arriving the Millennium Falcon is captured after it goes to investigate a small moon that turns out to be the Death Star. While Obi-Wan is off trying to disable the tractor beam that captured them Han and Luke discover that Princess Leah is being held in the detention area and set off to rescue her... I won\'t say any more as I don\'t want to spoil the ending.I think this is a film every body should see at least once, it might not be perfect but if it wasn\'t for this recent cinematic history would be quite different; it kick-started a revival in science fiction that lead to things like Battlestar Galactica, the return of Star Trek and Alien and was possibly the first ""block-buster"" film. In many ways it was more than just a film it was an event; everybody at my school was talking about it and little else, till one watched it you were completely out of the loop. The characters and there adventures in this and the other films in the franchise have become part of modern folklore.These comments were made based on the video released in the \'80s... so no extra CGI and Greedo didn\'t even attempt to fire before Han killed him.', 'After seeing all six episodes of the Star Wars saga several times apiece, I still think this initial entry is interesting but one of weaker ones in the series. Perhaps that\'s because by now, the special-effects look primitive but also because it\'s a little slow in parts, slower than the other five films. Sometimes, though, it\'s nice to have more lulls as these modern-day action films many times overdo the violence. This one, however, is just a bit too slow overall.The first hour of this film sets up the second hour plus the two sequels that followed in the 1980s, showing how the principal characters were united, who they are fighting against and what mystical powers they have at their disposal. Note: it was even interesting to watch this film decades later after the final installment, episode 3, was viewed. It made this first entry make a little more sense, knowing the complete story (who was related to whom, how some died, etc.). It was also a shock to go back and see the special-effects in here after viewing those final three films issued in recent years.I always got annoyed, to be honest, at two things in this initial Star Wars film I felt were overdone: the ""Rambo"" mentality in which hundreds of shots are fired at the good guys and never hit them and the constant arguing between Carrie Fisher (""Princess Leia"") and Harrison Ford (""Han Solo""). By the third film, thankfully, that bickering stopped and everyone was ""on the same page.""Despite how old this film is, it\'s a ""must"" for this collection since it sets up so much of what is to follow. It\'s also kind of fun to look at this again and see how young everyone looks!', 'Riveting first entry George Lucas\'s Stars Wars from a fantastic trilogy proved to be one of the biggest boxoffice successes of all time .

(Industrial , Light and Magic) , making many pre-Stars Wars flicks seem almost laughlable in retrospective.Writer/filmmaker George Lucas mixed the best of classic Science Fiction of the Fifties , pulp literature, old-fashionable cliff-hungers , comic books, Akira Kurosawa films and vintage fantasy to come up with the ultimate adventure . It displays wonderful settings, glamorous production design by John Barry, monumental art direction by Norman Reynolds and splendid set decoration by Roger Christian. As well as colorful and brilliant cinematography by Gilbert Taylor. And a vibrant and rousing musical score by the great John Williams, including the classic leitmotif . The movie\'s adrenaline-raising drive makes it irresistible. Being essential and indispensable watching it . Followed by ""The Empire strikes again"" by Irvin Keshner considered to be the best of the exciting trilogy and ""Return of the Jedi"" by Richard Marquand with similar artistic and technician team.', 'Having grown up with the ""Star Wars"" trilogy, then ""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"" is a classic in every sense of the word. This is the epic story of good vs. evil and of light vs. dark. But it is also a story of heroism, bravery and adventure. I am an fan-boy, yes, but what is there not to love about ""Star Wars""?George Lucas really managed to piece together a timeless classic that stands its own even today. And even with effects from 1977 it was light years ahead of its time, no pun intended. And the effects stand their ground even by todays standards.There is something uniquely amazing about the atmosphere and feel of the ""Star Wars"" universe. And it doesn\'t require much to be swept away and carried along to a galaxy far, far away...The cast in ""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"" did a good and memorable job with their individual roles and characters. And with this movie George Lucas established some characters that instantly became well-known and well-loved.""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"" is a movie of high space adventure with vibrant characters, creatures and spaceships. It is an enjoyable movie for the entire family, space nerds or not.If you are not already familiar with the legendary ""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"" movie, then it is more than due time to get to it.', ""There was no way my review of this classic slab of pulp sci-fi was ever going to be anything but glowing; as a nine year old I saw George Lucas' space opera on its original release and instantly became one of a legion of fans who spent the next twenty years worshipping at the altar of the great turkey-necked director (until The Phantom Menace shattered all of my illusions).Thirty years on, and I'm revisiting Star Wars with my two children, hoping that they will fall in love with it as much as I did, way back when all that seemed important was having a bag-full of marbles and a decent sized pile of comics to read.I'm not going to describe the plot (surely you know that!), nor am I going to go into great detail about how Lucas borrowed elements from the movies he loved to bring us his epic about a farm boy who becomes a legendary warrior; all I can say is that the film has lost none of its ability to astound and my kids sat entranced (despite not being able to follow the story without the benefit of some additional info from their sci-fi geek dad). My son (who is only three and a half ) might not understand what a 'rebellion' is, and my daughter (nearly six) may struggle with the concept of 'the force', but both got a kick from witnessing the whole Star Wars universe for the very first time.Chewbacca was an instant hit with my boy, whereas my girl identified with Leia, the gutsy princess. Both of them loved the brilliantly realised landscapes, aliens, robots and spaceships that have wowed film-fans for three decades (and who can blame them\x97the attention to detail and sheer creativity in design, costume, and make-up is staggering).It has since become evident that old George ain't always the greatest writer or director in the world (the last three Star Wars movies are proof of that); however, when he does get it right, he works miracles (he wrote Raiders of the Lost Ark too\x97another solid gold movie).Star Wars is perfect family entertainment that delivers amazing spectacle, unforgettable characters and enough movie magic to last a lifetime. In fact, why not do yourself a favour: get off the internet and go watch it right now (even if you have seen it hundreds of times before)."", ""My five children were all under the age of 10 when Star Wars came to the theater. While there had been other Sci-Fi movies with a theme of conflict in outer space, 'Star Wars' filled our imaginations like no other movie before it. The fantastic, strange worlds were presented almost like we were there too. Aliens sitting around a tavern, enjoying drinks and speaking in all sorts of languages. Nothing before had approached the sheer size of the space ships depicted here, huge cities traveling all over the galaxy. And how about the jump to hyper speed, then disappearing from the screen as the speed exceeds light speed! And the light sabres of the Jedi Knights. The Jedi Knights, a striking parallel to the Japanese Samurai.The Star Wars movies also were responsible for jump-starting the career of Harrison Ford, and today he is probably better known for his next trilogy, as Indiana Jones. The DVDs finally came out last month, and they are near perfect, as we should expect from Lucas Films and THX. The bit rate is high, and the picture is nothing short of superb. As is the Dolby EX surround track. My wife and I watched all three of the movies on DVD this week -- Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi -- compliments of our local public library. It was an appropriate reminder how good these movies are, and still ahead of their time. Nothing else has been made to compare to them."", 'From ""Star Wars "" onwards,sci-fi became the most popular genre for a while.It as a return to simplicity,in spite of the huge special effects.Actually,the screenplay could have been written by a ten-year old,and the characters ,stereotyped and Manichean ,will not do any harm,will not raise intellectual dilemma.Princess Leia Organa is totally sexless and seems to come from some forgotten fairy tale.Luke is a pale shadow from a knight of the round tables without a Graal to conquer,and Han Solo is the masculine raider we\'ve already seen in a lot of movies. Humor,like in Fredric\'s Brown tales?none,unless the two robots count. Mystery ,like in AC Clarke\'s 2001?none,unless Darth Vader \'s hidden identity counts? The last quarter of the movie recalls a giant video game. After ""star wars""(and close encounters of the third kind) ,intellectual sci-fi was over the hill;now two kinds would share the market between them:the harmless sci-fi for toddlers and brats(Star War saga,ET,the black hole)and the horrific ,brainless and witless sci-fi (Alien and sequels)""2001"" became an ET movie and its overwhelming genius did not influence anymore,alas.', 'Star Wars is a film that started it all. Not only the beginning of a 6 movie saga, but many other things as well. The film takes many things as influence (Shakespeare\'s Hamlet, Flash Gordon serials, old voodoo stuff, and Stanley Kubrick\'s 2001) and it turns it into a terrific movie experience. Some scenes are not all there, but they are made up for the extraordiary space fights and great quotes ""May the Force be With You"". So, all hail to George Lucas for creating a timeless masterpiece such as this and for many other things (by the way though, even though I think this film is well done, Episode 5 is my favorite).', ""'The New Hope' is the one that started them all for Star Wars back in 1977. It is only due to the prequels that we see its real place within the whole saga.It's a decent enough film, ground-breaking at the time.If you're going from prequels to this one you might find the opening 30 mins a little slow, but the pace really builds after the entry of Obi Wan and never really lets up from there.I find Mark Hamill a little too meek and wooden at times but Harrison Ford more than makes up for it, stealing every scene he's in as the brilliant Han Solo. His chemistry with Carrie Fisher's Princess Leia also adds to the fun.Start at Episode 1 and work up to this smart and funny sci fi film."", 'I recently revisited this, and remembered first seeing it. It wasn\'t the first movie to be heavily hyped. But I recall it as the first one to appeal to kids as a big adventure.In a couple ways, what\'s come since have ruined this. Lucas himself ruined it by deciding to make all those extra ones, making up the story as he went. And of course, every month on average we now have a new special effects movie that matches the star wars franchise in visual ambition. Many of these in fact are fueled by Lucas\' several companies.So its impossible to recapture that thrill. At the time, yes we knew he stole from Kurosawa, and leaned heavily on Joseph Campbell\'s notions of myth. But it all seemed so fresh, and Lucas himself came across as a visionary genius. And we needed that more than we needed entertainment.Remember, the US had just been through its first sleazy republican scandal and the nation as a whole was discouraged. But the world of movies was exploding. Woody Allen gave us ""Annie Hall."" Scorcese became known. And then this. The thing that impressed us at the time was how seriously it took itself, despite how childishly goofy that intergalactic bar was. Also how powerful the sounds and images were.The mythology was so clear. We had it for decades in science fiction and fantasy novels, indeed much better. But this was the first time we had them cinematically, and cinema when it works may be the most powerful of packaged imaginations. Oh how I wish we could see it as we did then.Now we notice, for instance, how ordinary the dogfights are. These used to thrill. We don\'t have all the mystery that made the thing deep. Now we know who everyone is and what is going on, and it is all so much more ordinary than what we imagined at the time as possibilities.In later years, Lucas would let us down, as a person and in this saga. In fact, I think he ruined some things. But for the year of this event, he was the most celebrated singer in the choir. And by me as well.What do I mean about ruining? Things evolve. When one thing finds a niche and flourishes, it pinches off other things. When ""Birth of a Nation"" became a huge success, it froze movies as filmed plays with a larger stage instead of one of the several other directions it could have taken. Again, there was a period after talkies reinvented the medium where there was a struggle among various different directions. This you can clearly see in the period. In retrospect, it appears as if the world could have only turned out the way it did. But the trends that win aren\'t the best at all.So ""Star Wars"" opened up a gateway for how effects could transform cinema into something far beyond what we had before. And then it closed that gateway, so that effects now cannot show you something unfamiliar. Instead, it all has to be the familiar taken to some extreme.Yes, it was a goose at the time. But Star Wars killed the greater possibilities of science fiction. In film, at least, and because books are inherently cinematic now, in books too.Ted\'s Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.', 'Princess Leia is captured and held hostage by the Imperial Army as it seeks to rule the Galactic Empire. An old Jedi Knight by the name of Ben ""Obi-Wan"" Kenobi may just be hers, and the rebels only hope. Teaming up with farm boy Luke Skywalker, scoundrel Captain Han Solo, and a couple of quirky droids, Kenobi sets off on a mission that could well shape the destiny of the Galaxy, and all who dwell within it.Back in 1977 I was but a wee 11 year old boy, weened on films from all genres by my movie loving parents, I had no idea that Star Wars was to have the same impact on me as Jaws had two summers previously, where yet again I found myself queueing around the block for two whole hours to see a film in a one screen theatre. My love of cinema firmly cemented, Star Wars was the start of a love affair that lasts to this very day.As the years have rolled by and my love of cinema has taken on more in-depth and serious tones, I have come to realise that Star Wars proves to be a far from flawless picture. Certainly its detractors do point to some frayed acting and call the plot structure a jazzed up good versus evil axis, while the charge of George Lucas referencing many prior pictures most assuredly stands, but really do those things matter? No they do not, because Star Wars opened up a new world of cinema, something of a portal to youngsters such as I, it got people talking and debating about the merits of model work in films (which is of an extraordinary high standard here), it nudged film makers to explore being bigger and bolder in their approach, and crucially, above all else, it got film goers hungry again, a hankering for more please if you may. Now it has to be said that all that followed 20th Century Fox\'s historic blockbuster didn\'t run with the baton, in fact most pale into comparison on impact value, but for better or worse (depending on the discerning viewers peccadilloes), Star Wars stands as a bastion of adventure laden entertainment.It is by definition one of the most successful films in history, George Lucas perhaps didn\'t know it at the time, but in what was to become an almost operatic anthology, he didn\'t just make a movie, he created a whole new world seeping with style and rich texture. Almost as amazing as the success of the series, is how it has become part of modern day pop culture, anything from religion to everyday speak has at some time or another referenced Lucas\' baby. Ultimately, though, it\'s one single thing that made (and still does make) Star Wars so great, it\'s that it has the ability to lift the audience into a rousing united feel good cheer; and that is something that few films can ever lay claim too. In 1977 it was an awe inspiring event to watch in the theatre, now here in my middle age it\'s an event that is like hugging a dear old friend, a friend that I know will never ever let me down no matter how many times I turn to it. 10/10', 'I`ve never really thought much of STAR WARS . I remember when it was released in 1977 everyone was going bannanas as to how good it was . I finally managed to see it when it was broadcast on television in 1982 and was very disappointed with what I saw , okay it was entertaining to a certain degree but I didn`t believe for one moment it deserved the hype or massive audience figures . One other thing that sprung to my mind many years later is that it`s unoriginal!!!! SPOILERS TO THIS AND LOTR !!!!I can`t help thinking that Obi Wan Kenobi has been based on Gandalf from LORD OF THE RINGS . They`re both wise old men , they both "" die "" a heroic death and both come come back as etheral beings in the trilogy and both are played in the films by Knights of the stage. However whereas Ian Mckellan gives an outstanding performance as Gandalf Alec Guinness has little impact as Obi Wan . I do not say this lightly as I rate Guinness as the greatest actor of the 20th century . In fact as one reviewer has already pointed out none of the actors give much of a performance except Harrison Ford who is the only member of the cast who went onto become a household name . Compare the performances of the cast of the LOTR trilogy who could all easily pass as Knights of the stageI`m not saying this is a bad movie - it`s not . It is entertaining and does have a sense of humour and the costume design is excellent especially the stormtrooper uniforms but what I`m saying is it`s not a great one either and certainly doesn`t deserve to be in the IMDB top ten movies . And as a footnote is it just coincidence that Christopher Lee was cast in ATTACK OF THE CLONES after appearing in LORD OF THE RINGS ?', 'Note: Italicized paragraphs describe scenes added for the film\'s 1997 special edition and updated for its DVD release.An opening title card reads:\'A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...\'It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire. During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal secret plans to the Empire\'s ultimate weapon, the DeathStar, an armored space station with enough power to destroy an entire planet. Pursued by the Empire\'s sinister agents, Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) races home aboard her starship, custodian of the stolen plans that can save her people and restore freedom to the galaxy.\'Following the opening crawl, the frame moves down in the star field and we see a pitched battle between two starships in orbit around the desert planet of Tatooine. A small Rebel blockade runner, the Tantive IV, is being pursued by a mammoth Imperial star destroyer, the Devastator. Inside, protocol droid C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) and utility droid R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) are tossed about as their ship endures a barrage of laser bolts, and ""3PO"" concludes that escaping capture will be impossible. The Rebel ship is so heavily damaged that its main power reactor must be shut down. It is caught in the Imperial destroyer\'s tractor beam, pulled into the hold of the larger ship, and boarded by stormtroopers from the Empire\'s 501st Legion.A huge firefight ensues in the corridors of the Rebel ship, with many Rebel soldiers being lost in the battle. When the smoke clears, Darth Vader (David Prowse; voice: James Earl Jones), a man dressed in a black cape, black armor, and a black helmet that obscures all his features, briefly surveys the damage before interrogating the ship\'s captain, Antillies, who claims that the ship is on a diplomatic mission to the planet Alderaan. Vader perceives that he is lying, noting that a consular ship would have an ambassador on board. (In actuality there is a diplomat aboard - Princess Leia Organa - but she is hiding from Vader, the second-ranking man in the Empire, which tends to support Vader\'s thesis that somebody on this ship is up to something.) Upon learning that ""the plans"" were not downloaded into the ship\'s computer, Vader strangles the captain. He then tells the troops to search the entire ship and to bring all the passengers to him - alive.C-3PO and R2-D2 manage to escape damage from the firefight. R2-D2 meets up with Princess Leia, who loads him with the stolen plans and records a holographic message for the small droid to take to the planet\'s surface. R2-D2 and C-3PO get away from the ship aboard an escape pod and go to the planet below; Imperial troops choose not to destroy the pod, as their scans detect no living organism on board, and presume it ejected due to a malfunction. Moments later the princess is stunned by Imperial troops and taken to Vader. He tells her that the Rebels have stolen some secret Imperial plans and transmitted them to her ship. She feigns ignorance and protests to Vader that she is a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to the planet Alderaan, but Vader doesn\'t believe her and orders her taken away. Vader\'s adjutant aide, Commander Jir (Al Lampert), insists that holding her captive is dangerous; news of her captivity would generate sympathy for the rebellion against the Empire. Vader instructs Jir to deceive the Senate and permanently erase any trace of Leia\'s whereabouts by faking her [accidental] death. Upon being notified by another officer that an empty escape pod was jettisoned during the firefight, he concludes that the Princess hid the stolen plans in the pod.C-3PO and R2-D2 land on the desert planet; R2-D2 mentions a mission to deliver some plans, but C-3PO is more concerned with staying in one piece long enough to find civilization. The two split up, and both are eventually captured by a group of diminutive scavengers called Jawas. The Jawas are junk traders, and R2-D2 and C-3PO are their newest assets. Meanwhile, a unit of Imperial Sandtroopers find the crashed pod and discover droid parts and tracks leading away from the crash site.The Jawas travel to the Great Chott Salt Flat settlement to sell droids and equipment to local homesteaders, eventually arriving at the homestead of Owen Lars (Phil Brown), a moisture farmer. The farmer purchases C-3PO for his translation skills, as he is fluent in six million forms of communication, but initially decides to buy a cheaper utility droid, R5-D4, which breaks down almost immediately after purchase. Eager to deflect accusations of selling shoddy merchandise, the Jawas offer R2 as a replacement. Owen accepts and tells his young 18-year-old nephew, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), to clean them up and put them to work. Luke had plans to meet some friends in the nearby town of Anchorhead, but his plans are put aside for work. During the cleanup, Luke stumbles across a short clip of the message stored in R2 by Princess Leia. The message is for someone named \'Obi-Wan Kenobi\', and is a desperate plea for help. R2 insists that the message is simply a malfunction (""old data""), but Luke insists on hearing the complete message, intrigued by Leia\'s beauty. R2 then states that if Luke removes his restraining bolt, he might be able to play the rest of the message. Luke removes the bolt, but R2 doesn\'t play the message and claims not to know what Luke is talking about. Luke is called away for dinner (forgetting to replace the bolt, which will keep R2 within the boundaries of the moisture farm) and asks C-3PO to finish cleaning R2.During dinner, Luke tells his aunt and uncle that the droids may belong to someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi. This news greatly disturbs Uncle Owen, but he won\'t say why. Luke asks if Obi-Wan is possibly related to a hermit named Ben Kenobi who lives several miles away in the Dune Sea area, a vast terrain of sand and rocky canyons. Owen claims that Ben is ""just a crazy old man,"" and that Obi-Wan is dead; Owen makes a comment which seems to indicate that Obi-Wan Kenobi knew Luke\'s long-deceased father, Anakin, but when Luke presses Owen for details, his uncle quickly changes the subject and instructs Luke to erase the droids\' memories the next morning. Luke - who hopes to leave home for training at a nearby Imperial Military Academy to become a space pilot - leaves the room angrily to return to cleaning the droids. Luke\'s Aunt Beru (Shelagh Fraser) tells Owen that Luke is too much like his father to remain with them, but Owen holds out hope that Luke\'s desire for adventure will subside - and expresses a fear that Luke is too much like his father... suggesting that Owen may know something of Anakin\'s terrible past.After dinner, Luke discovers that R2-D2 has escaped to find Obi-Wan Kenobi. Luke tells 3PO that it\'s too late to look for R2 because of the dangerous Sand People (also called Tusken Raiders) in the area, and that they will set out first thing in the morning to go look for him (hopefully before Owen discovers that due to Luke\'s negligence, his newest investment has disappeared).The following morning, Luke and 3PO set out in Luke\'s landspeeder to find R2. They locate him on the scanner and catch up with him. As soon as they find him, R2 informs them that his own scanner is picking up several creatures closing in on them. Luke fears the Sand People have found them, and confirms it using a set of minoculars. One ambushes them, hitting Luke over the head and knocking him unconscious. C-3PO goes tumbling down the side of a sand dune. R2 runs and hides.After stealing some parts off of Luke\'s speeder, the Sand People are frightened away by the sound of a vicious beast. The sound comes from a mysterious hooded figure. The figure checks on Luke and takes his hood off to reveal his features. He is an old, bearded man, who gently touches Luke\'s forehead. Luke quickly comes to and recognizes the man as Ben Kenobi (Alec Guinness). Luke tells the man that his droid claims to belong to an Obi-Wan Kenobi. This knowledge startles the old man, who reveals (with a look of ancient mystery on his face) that he is Obi-Wan Kenobi but that he hasn\'t gone by that name in many years. After rescuing C-3PO, they go to Obi-Wan\'s home to discuss the matter.At Obi-Wan\'s home, Luke learns that Obi-Wan knew Anakin and that they were both Jedi Knights of the Old Republic and veterans of the talked about \'Clones Wars\'. Luke had been told by his uncle that his father was a navigator on a spice freighter; Owen had been trying to protect Luke from the truth about his father, or perhaps simply trying to keep him safe. (Note: it\'s not clear that Owen knows the truth about Luke\'s father, other than that he was killed in a dangerous line of duty). Obi-Wan then produces Anakin\'s lightsaber, an energy sword which was the chosen weapon of the Jedi Knights; he seems to have kept it safe for some time. He gives the weapon to Luke, saying that Anakin wanted him to have it when he was old enough, but Owen would have none of it. Obi-Wan explains that a Jedi receives his power from the Force, an energy field that is created by all living beings that ""surrounds us, penetrates us, and binds the galaxy together."" But there is also a Dark Side to the Force, which draws power from negative emotions and baser impulses. A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was once a pupil of Obi-Wan, was seduced by this Dark Side. Vader betrayed and murdered Anakin, then became the Dark Lord of the Sith, the most feared enforcer of the Emperor. In this capacity, he proceeded to hunt down his former comrades, and the Jedi Order is now all but extinct.At this point Obi-Wan has R2 play Princess Leia\'s complete message. The princess reminds Obi-Wan of his past service to her father in the Clone Wars, and conveys his plea to assist in the Rebellion against the Empire. She senses that her mission to bring Obi-Wan to Alderaan has failed, and tells Obi-Wan that she has embedded information crucial to the rebellion in R2\'s memory banks. She asks Obi-Wan to deliver the droid to her father on Alderaan so that the information can be retrieved, and repeats her plea that he is now her ""only hope.""Obi-Wan cannot hope to undertake such a mission alone due to his advanced age, so he tells Luke that he should learn the ways of the Force and accompany him to Alderaan. Luke is adamant that he can\'t go, and that he must stay on Tatooine and help his uncle. Obi-Wan counters that the Rebellion needs Luke\'s help, and that the young woman in the message needs Luke\'s help (though she has not mentioned any personal request for help). They decide to go to the city of Anchorhead so that Obi-Wan can book a transport to Mos Eisely space port.Meanwhile, the Devastator has docked at the Death Star, a gargantuan space station resembling a small moon. Vader rendezvous with Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin (Peter Cushing), the high ranking governor of the Imperial Outland Regions, and they enter a conference room where they meet the station\'s Command Triumvirate leaders in a high level conference: Admiral Antonio Motti (Richard LeParmentier), High General Cassio Tagge (Don Henderson), and Chief Officer Mordramin Bast (Leslie Schofield) among other Imperial officers. As the Triumvirs argue about the best way to exploit their newest ""technological terror,"" Tarkin tells them that the Emperor has decided to dissolve the Imperial Senate; giving full control of the Galaxy\'s star systems to each of the regional governors under him and use the Death Star to intimidate all of the Empire\'s star systems into submission, suggesting that fear of force is preferable to its actual use. Admiral Motti is extremely confident in the new space station, calling it \'the ultimate power in the universe.\' However, General Tagge is adamant that the Death Star is not invincible, and that the Rebels will figure this out if they have a chance to read its schematics. Vader tells them that the ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. Motti callously mocks Vader\'s Jedi heritage, noting that the Force has not helped him recover the stolen schematics or pinpoint the Rebellion\'s headquarters. Angered, Vader uses the Force to strangle Motti, until Tarkin orders him to stand down. The commanders decide to focus on interrogating Leia until she gives up the location of the Rebel Headquarters. They will then use the Death Star to destroy it, killing two birds with one stone.As Luke and his companions travel to Anchorhead, they find the Jawa sandcrawler, completely destroyed with all the Jawas slaughtered; although they appear to be victims of the Sand People, Obi-Wan recognizes signs which indicate an attack by Imperial stormtroopers. Luke realizes that the only reason Imperial troops would kill Jawas is because they are looking for the droids which escaped the battle, and he races home, over Obi-Wan\'s objections that he is likely endangering his own life, hoping to warn Owen and Beru.However, Luke is too late. The Imperials have apparently come and gone, burned the homestead, and killed his aunt and uncle. Luke returns to Obi-Wan (who has used the opportunity afforded by Luke\'s trip to accord the massacred Jawas some measure of dignity), saying that with no reason to remain, he wants to go with him to Alderaan. More importantly, he declares his wish to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like his father once was.Luke, Obi-Wan and the two droids now travel to Mos Eisley, the spaceport and capital city of Tatooine. Before entering the city, Obi-Wan warns Luke and the droids that Mos Eisley is a hotbed of crime and near-lawlessness. Luke assures Obi-Wan that he knows how to handle himself in a fight. Upon entering the spaceport they are approached by Imperial troops at a roadblock asking questions about the two droids they have with them. Obi-Wan appears to induce a trance-like state in the lead guard, persuading him that these are not the droids they are looking for. When Luke is puzzled by the ease of their passage, Obi-Wan explains that the Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded.At the Mos Eisley Cantina, Luke gets into a scuffle with two criminals, a deformed human named Dr. Evazan and his alien companion Ponda Baba, who threaten to kill him. When one of the creatures pulls a gun on Kenobi, the old Jedi Knight defends himself with his lightsaber - slashing off the creature\'s gun arm before it can shoot. Moments later they meet smuggler Han Solo (Harrison Ford), captain of the Millennium Falcon, and his first mate, Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), a 7-foot-tall, 200-year-old Wookiee. Upon learning that Obi-Wan and Luke are trying to avoid Imperial capture, Captain Solo gives his price as 10,000 credits for the trip. Luke balks at that price, stating that they could almost buy their own ship for that, but Han is dubious that they could fly it themselves. Obi-Wan tells Solo that they will pay him 2,000 credits now and 15,000 more once they reach Alderaan. Han agrees.After Luke and Obi-Wan leave, Han tells Chewbacca that 17,000 credits could really save his neck. As Chewbacca leaves to make pre-flight preparations, Han hangs back to take care of their bar tab, and is stopped by Greedo (Maria De Aragon and Paul Blake), a bounty hunter working for feared crimelord Jabba Desilijic Tiure, aka: Jabba the Hutt. Apparently some time earlier, Jabba had hired Han to transport a shipment of glitterstim spice (an illegal narcotic), but Han had to dump the shipment due to an unexpected Imperial boarding. As Greedo points a blaster pistol at Solo and forces him toward a secluded section of the bar, Han insists that he has the 8,000 credits he needs to cover the loss. Greedo suggests that Solo give it to him as a bribe not to turn him over to Jabba, forcing Han to admit that he doesn\'t actually have the money yet. Realizing that Greedo will either turn him over to Jabba or kill him for the bounty that Jabba has placed on him, Solo quietly removes his heavy pistol under the table, and when Greedo admits that he would just as soon see him dead as alive, Solo pre-emptively fires and kills him. On his way out, Han throws the bartender a few coins, apologizing for ""the mess"" he left.At the docking bay, Han is confronted by Jabba the Hutt and several other associates. Jabba expresses frustration over Greedo\'s death, and reminds Han of the nature of their business; he cannot ""make any exceptions"" of those who fail or cross him, lest he appear weak. Han insists that he will soon have enough money to pay off his debt, with interest, he just needs more time. Jabba reluctantly agrees, but warns Han that this is his last chance.Luke sells his landspeeder to raise money for their initial payment to Captain Solo. They head to the docking bay where the Millennium Falcon is being prepared for flight. Luke is somewhat perturbed to discover that the Falcon is a 60-year-old, run-down YT-1300 freighter, but Han assures him that he has made extensive modifications to ensure that she can run rings around any modern capital ship. Meanwhile, Imperial troops believe they are hot on the trail of the two droids when a local informant tells them the whereabouts of the fugitives after recognizing Luke and Obi-Wan.No sooner do Luke, Obi-Wan and the droids board the Millennium Falcon than the Imperial troops come running into the docking bay, hoping to arrest Luke and Obi-Wan and capture the droids. The troops fire at Solo and the Falcon, but the ship manages to escape. Once they clear the planet, they are immediately pursued by two huge Imperial star destroyers. Solo remarks that his passengers must be of particular interest to the Empire. They jump to light speed, escaping the Imperial ships.Princess Leia has been tortured by the Imperials and undergone a mind probe in an effort to extract the location of the Rebels\' home base. They have found nothing. Tarkin, Vader, and Motti shift tactics, threatening to destroy the Princess\'s home planet of Alderaan if she won\'t reveal the Rebels\' location. She reluctantly tells them that the Rebel base is on the planet Dantooine. Tarkin then orders his officers to proceed with Alderaan\'s destruction, noting that Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration of the Death Star\'s power. Alderaan is destroyed by a single blast from the Death Star\'s enormously powerful laser blaster while Leia is forced to watch.On board the Millennium Falcon, Obi-Wan is training Luke in the ways of the Force when he is greatly disturbed by a tremor in the Force. He feels that millions of people have died in an instant amidst great suffering, though he doesn\'t know how. He decides to meditate on this further as Luke continues an exercise in allowing the Force to guide his reflexes. Han is not impressed, and explains that he does not believe in the Force. Luke, however, manages to use his lightsaber to deflect four laser bolts in a row from a remote droid - all while wearing a helmet which covers his eyes.Back on the Death Star, Tarkin and Vader receive a report that there once was indeed a Rebel base on Dantooine but it has long since been abandoned. Outraged at Leia\'s successful trickery, Tarkin orders her scheduled for execution.Luke realizes that he is learning how to sense the Force. One of the Falcon\'s signals informs them that they are approaching Alderaan, but upon exiting light speed, they find the Millennium Falcon is in an asteroid field instead of Alderaan\'s orbit. Han confirms that they are in the right location but that the planet is missing; Obi-Wan quietly states that the planet has been destroyed by the Empire, but Solo laughingly insists that all the Empire\'s ships combined wouldn\'t have enough firepower to destroy a planet. Moments later they are overflown by an Imperial Twin Ion Engine (TIE) snubfighter. Obi-Wan concludes it is too small for long range flight, so there must be an Imperial base or ship nearby. As they chase after the fighter to keep it from notifying the Empire of their location, they see the fighter heading toward a small moon - the Death Star. They are caught in the Death Star\'s tractor beam and, helpless to resist, are pulled aboard the station into a docking bay. Obi-Wan tells them that neither fighting or surrender are viable choices, but a third option is available to them.Imperial troops board the Falcon, but its crew are hiding in smuggling compartments below the floor. Vader orders scanning equipment to be brought aboard to look for life signs. While standing near the Falcon, he senses a presence he has not felt for some time. Vader leaves the hangar, pursued by the frustrating sense he is overlooking something of great importance.When a scanning teams boards the Falcon to set up their equipment, Luke and Solo manages to overpower them and lures the two guarding stormtroopers just outside on board as well to kill them both and steal their armor uniforms. The helmets conceal their identity and allow them to infiltrate a troop command center outside the docking port. Inside the command center, R2 plugs into the station computer system and discovers the location of the tractor beam generator. Obi-Wan sets out to shut down the generator so that the ship can leave. Luke wants to accompany him, but Obi-Wan orders Luke to stay, noting that Luke\'s destiny now splits paths from his own. Perhaps sensing that this is the last time he will see Luke in this reality, he tells Luke, ""The Force will be with you... always.""After Obi-Wan leaves, R2 discovers that the princess is being held prisoner on board the station. Luke suddenly takes the initiative, sparing no effort to convince Solo and Chewbacca to assist him in what is surely going to be a very risky rescue. Han, initially scared for his own neck, eventually agrees, but only after Luke suggests that a great monetary reward would surely follow her rescue. Luke and Han take Chewbacca ""captive"" and assume their trooper identities in order to infiltrate the prison block. In the prison block, the officer in command becomes suspicious of their arrival since he was not notified about any prisoner transfer. As a result, Luke and Han\'s escorted ""prisoner"" escapes and a firefight erupts between the Imperials and Luke, Han, and Chewbacca. They manage to take out all the Imperials, but set off an alarm in the process. A squad of troops are sent to investigate. Han and Luke know they have only moments to find the princess\'s cell and escape.They find the princess, but the arriving troops cut off the only escape route. Leia shoots a hole in a garbage chute and tells everyone to dive in. They escape the Imperials, only to find themselves trapped in a large garbage compactor. To make matters worse, the compactor also houses a large, serpent-like creature - the dianoga - which yanks Luke under the murky, stagnant water in the compactor, almost drowning him. The creature inexplicably lets Luke go, but just as they catch their breath, the compactor activates and the walls begin to move in, threatening to crush Han, Luke, Leia, and Chewbacca. Luke calls 3PO on the communicator and orders him to have R2 shut down all garbage compactors in the detention level. R2 complies just in time to save them and then open their compactor\'s door to let them out.Meanwhile, Vader informs Tarkin that he senses through the Force that Kenobi is aboard the station. Tarkin is doubtful, but the discussion is soon interrupted by an emergency report: Princess Leia has escaped! Vader tells a shocked and bewildered Tarkin the true explanation for Leia\'s impossible escape - ""Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him."" Sensing that Obi-Wan wishes a final showdown, Vader sets off to find him. Unbeknownst to anyone, Kenobi has deactivated the tractor beam generator.After their escape from the compactor, Luke and Han dispose of their stormtrooper armor, but keep the troopers\' utility belts and weapons. On their way back to the ship they\'re cut off by more troops. They are split up, with Han and Chewbacca fighting together and Luke and Leia running on their own.After being cornered between a great air shaft and a group of troopers, Luke shoots a blast door\'s controls with his blaster, locking the troops on the other side of the door. Unfortunately, the blast also destroys the controls that extend the bridge across the air shaft. After a gunfight with stormtroopers on the other side of the shaft, Luke uses a cable and grappling hook from his freshly confiscated Imperial utility belt to swing himself and Leia safely across the gorge.Obi-Wan, on his way back to the Falcon, encounters Vader. They exchange barbed comments. Vader boasts to his former master that he is so much more experienced and powerful than he was the last time they met that the tables have now turned, with Vader the more powerful of the two. Obi-Wan replies that Vader\'s turn to evil has made him oblivious to the Force\'s true power. A ferocious lightsaber duel ensues.Luke, Leia, Han and Chewbacca meet at the entrance to the docking bay. The lightsaber duel on the other side of the bay distracts the troops guarding the ship, allowing the four of them, along with R2 and 3PO, to sneak across to board the Falcon. As Kenobi and Vader continue to fight, Kenobi informs Vader that if Vader strikes him down, he shall become even more powerful, beyond what Vader could possibly imagine. Kenobi, seeing that the four heroes and two droids are safely boarding the Falcon, takes one last look from his comrade\'s son to the man who betrayed him, and smilingly withdraws his saber, allowing Vader to slice through him. His body instantly disappears. Vader is stunned and confused by this, as he determines that no one is in Kenobi\'s now-empty cloak on the floor.Luke, appalled by the sight of his mentor being struck down by Vader, lets out a shout of horror, alerting all of the troops to their presence. Another firefight immediately erupts, and they barely make it aboard the ship with their lives. Luke stays behind, attempting to shoot every Imperial soldier in the hangar, despite his friends urging him to join them on the ship so they can escape. Finally, he relents, hearing Obi-Wan\'s voice telling him to run, as Vader catches a glimpse of him through a rapidly closing set of blast doors. When the Falcon flies out of the docking bay, the Imperials are unable to activate the tractor beam, thanks to Kenobi.Having blasted their way out of the station\'s defense range, they are confronted by four Imperial TIE fighters. Luke and Han man two large gun turrets on the top and bottom of the Falcon and manage to destroy all four ships. Han starts to boast to Leia about his amazing abilities during her rescue. She insists that the Empire let them escape in order to track them to the Rebel base. Han is doubtful of that as she explains to Han that R2 is carrying the technical readouts to the Death Star. She has high hopes that when the data is analyzed, a weakness can be found in the station.Back aboard the station, Leia\'s fears are confirmed as Vader and Tarkin discuss their plan to track the Falcon to the hidden Rebel base. The Falcon makes it to the base, located on the fourth moon of the gas giant Yavin Prime. After R2\'s data is analyzed, it is determined that the Death Star does indeed have a weakness that can be exploited; a small (two meters) exhaust port not protected by any shielding, through which a well-placed proton torpedo could reach the main reactor and destroy the station. The port is situated in a narrow trench protected by General ARea Defense Integration Anti-spacecraft Network (GARDIAN) turbo-lasers. The Rebel commander, General Dodonna (Alex McCrindle), theorizes that since the GARDIAN array is designed to repel large scale assaults from capital ships, it could easily be outmaneuvered by smaller and faster snubfighters. A plan is devised in which a squadron of Y-Wing assault bombers (Gold Squadron, led by Captain Jon ""Dutch"" Vander (Angus MacInnes)), will skim the trench. A second squadron (Red Squadron, commanded by Captain Garven Dreis (Drewe Henley)), comprised of the faster, more maneuverable X-Wing snubfighters, will attempt to draw enemy fire away from the bombers. Luke will be flying one of the X-Wings, under the call sign Red Five. Fellow pilot Wedge Antilles (Denis Lawson) is skeptical about succeeding, but Luke is confident that the task can be accomplished, noting that he used to shoot at animal targets on Tatooine which were not much bigger than two meters.The Rebels set out to attack the Death Star just as the station enters the Yavin system. The Death Star will have to orbit to Yavin\'s far side in order to have a shot at the moon on which the base is located. The approximately 30 Rebel fighters have less than 30 minutes to fly to the station and destroy it.As Luke heads to the hanger, he is reunited with Biggs Darklighter (Garrick Hagon), who used to fly with Luke on Tatooine. Biggs congratulates Luke on finally making it off Tatooine and tells him that the coming battle will be just like old times.Having apparently collected the balance of his 17,000 credits payment for delivering the plans to the Rebellion (plus some unspecified reward for helping Leia escape from the Death Star), Han refuses to join the fight, stating that his reward will be useless if he is killed, and that he would rather take his money and go pay off his debts. Luke is disappointed, but boards his fighter and takes off, right after R2 is loaded into the rear of the fighter to provide technical assistance. Upon departure, he hears what sounds like Obi-Wan\'s voice speaking to him, saying ""The Force will be with you."" He quickly dismisses it.Both squadrons approach the Death Star and Wedge Antilles briefly marvels at its size before Captain Dreis cuts off the idle chatter and orders the squadrons to attack speed. Red Squadron initiates a strafing run on the station\'s surface to divert attention from the bombers, and Luke makes a run that detonates a mammoth fire within part of the Death Star - a fire so large his own ship suffers minor burns. When Vader is informed that the GARDIAN turbo-lasers are having trouble targeting the small rebel ships, he orders fighters led by Black Squadron, his personal elite TIE fighter squadron, to engage the X-Wings individually. In short order, six TIE fighters join the battle, soon followed by others, and Red Squadron scrambles to keep them away from the trenches. Dreis warns a wingman of an attacking TIE fighter but the X-Wing is immediately shot down before Biggs himself comes under attack; Luke swings behind the attacker and shoots him down.Vader notices Dutch and his Y-Wing group breaking away from the primary attack. He assigns two Black Squadron pilots, Mauler and Backstabber, to escort him as he boards a TIE Advanced x1 fighter to engage the bombers himself. Before this command group launches, the sky battle rages on and Luke himself comes under attack; Wedge rescues him by shooting into the belligerent TIE fighter literally nose to nose, just as Dutch and Gold Squadron commence the attack into the trenches.Vader and his two wingmen easily outmaneuver the Y-Wings, methodically dispatching them one by one; first pilot Tyree is killed, as Dutch begins to panic despite angry urging by his surviving wingman. Dutch is then killed and the surviving Gold Squadron ship aborts his run before he himself is destroyed.With Gold Squadron effectively wiped out, Dreis orders the surviving X-Wing pilots to start a second attack run down the trench. As they approach the exhaust port, Dreis turns on his targeting computer as two other ships cover his tail from enemy fire. The escorting ships are destroyed, but they buy enough time for Dreis to take a shot at the exhaust port. His shot misses and merely impacts on the surface. Moments later he loses an engine to Vader\'s gunnery and his fighter spirals into the surface of the station.Now nominally in charge of Red Squadron, Luke decides that it is his responsibility to try to destroy the port. R2 is preoccupied trying to keep the ship running, despite all of the damage they are sustaining. With Biggs and Wedge flying his wing, they start down the trench. Moments later, they are pursued by Vader and his wingmen, who partially disable Wedge\'s ship. Luke tells Wedge to disengage, seeing that he can\'t be of any help in a crippled ship. Vader allows Wedge to withdraw, ordering his men to continue to pursue the two ships in the trench. Vader fires again, hitting Biggs\' ship and destroying it. Luke is grieved by the loss of his friend, but presses on.As Luke gets closer to his target, he hears the voice of Obi-Wan, telling him to ""use the Force"" and rely on his instincts more than the technology in his ship. Heeding that advice, Luke switches off his targeting computer and continues flying down the trench. When asked by Mission Control why he switched off the computer, Luke responds that nothing is wrong.Meanwhile, the Death Star has completed its run around Yavin and is cleared to fire on the Rebel moon. The countdown for the firing sequence begins. Bast tells Tarkin that he has analyzed the attack and concludes there is a real threat to the station. Tarkin scoffs at evacuation and insists the Empire will prevail. He remains on the station while some of the Imperial officers and troops evacuate as a precaution.As Luke draws on the power of the Force to help him hit his target, Vader senses the strength of the Force in his prey. He takes a shot, which misses the ship but hits R2-D2. Just as he locks on to Luke\'s ship to finish him off, Backstabber\'s ship explodes unexpectedly. Out of nowhere appears the Millennium Falcon, which has just destroyed the Imperial fighter - diving vertically towards Vader and the remaining wingman. This sudden turn of events distracts Mauler; he loses control of his ship and crashes into Vader\'s. Mauler\'s ship ricochets into the trench wall, destroying it, and sends Vader\'s ship spinning out of control, up and away from the Death Star.Han informs Luke that he is all clear to fire. Luke, having drawn upon the power of the Force, releases his proton torpedoes, which enter the exhaust port perfectly on target. Luke, the Falcon and a few other fighters race away from the Death Star just as the Death Star prepares to fire on the moon. Only seconds before the station fires, it explodes into a huge fireball, sending millions of fragments into space. Tarkin, Motti, Tagge, and most of the senior Imperial staff are killed. With that triumph, Kenobi reminds Luke that the Force will be with him, always.Vader, having been thrown into space during his collision with the wingman, is now apparently the only one to have escaped the station\'s destruction. He eventually manages to regain control of his wildly gyrating fighter, and when he finally stabilizes, he flies off to meet the Imperial Fleet as the Rebels head home to their base. When they reach the base, Luke is clearly delighted that Han returned to help him. Leia is thrilled to see both of her friends alive. And everyone is ecstatic that the Death Star has been destroyed. Their celebration is briefly interrupted as R2 is pulled from Luke\'s ship. He is heavily damaged from Vader\'s gunfire and does not respond to C-3PO. The golden robot is terribly concerned, but Luke and two mechanics assure him that R2 is repairable and will be fine.Later, an awards ceremony is held in a huge hall. Hundreds of Rebel soldiers, officers, and pilots are present. A door at the rear of the hall opens to reveal Luke, Han, and Chewbacca. They walk down the aisle to where Leia awaits, along with several Rebel leaders and dignitaries.Also present are a freshly polished C-3PO and a freshly overhauled and looking better-than-new R2-D2. Upon reaching the front of the great hall, Luke and Han are awarded medals for bravery by a smiling Princess Leia. The hall erupts into thunderous applause.']"
1,Star Wars,The Empire Strikes Back,80684,"[""Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980) is an excellent timeless classic that it is the best sequel of all time. I love this film to death, it is my second favorite film and the best sequel in the Star Wars franchise that I love. The Empire Strikes Back is a movie that it is one of the best sequels I can think of, it is right there with Aliens (1986), it is right there with Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) it is an excellent sequel and it really does establish The Empire as a value treat. Empire Strikes Back is still and excellent film which I really believe is a timeless classic. This is my second favorite film from director Irvin Kershner. Number 1 favorite Irvin Kershner film will be RoboCop 2 (1990) which is very underrated action flick. I still have to review those movies someday.Empire Strikes Back (1980) is the best one of the series, because it's deeper, darker, more philosophical. It's great because Darth Vader and the Empire are at their most menacing, the direction is creative, the characters feel real, the nature of the Force is explored more without losing its mysticism, and the pacing is, as George Lucas would put it, faster and more intense than any other film in the saga.The plot is actually more a rescue mission that Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is coming to rescue his friends Han Solo, Princess Leia Organa, C-3PO and Chewbacca are captured on a planet Bespin in Cloud City from villainous Darth Vader. Han Solo's friend Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) set the up and with Darth Vader he set a trap for Luke. Also Luke studied the Force under Jedi Master Yoda to become a full Jedi Knight but in the end he must confront Darth Vader (David Prowse) by him self. The origins of Luke Skywalker are reveled.Empire Strikes Back was released in 1980 it is directed by Irvin Kershner this time and not George Lucas. Because George Lucas decide that he want to make this sequel independent one, so he ended up coming with his own, founding for the film. Getting a loan and money he earn from the first movie and it success, so he decided he wanted, to found the film him self, and he wanted to be more an executive producer to keep an eye on the lamp, he moved to a bigger studio in Orange County, California, so he diced to be more a producer he did not want to direct Empire Strikes Back. So his first choice was Irvin Kershner, who was a professor at UC in the UC film school, that George attended too and he always liked Irvin Kershner and of course he was a former professor and it was a hard way talk him to do it and the first time Irvin Kershner didn't want to do it, so George called Irvin's agent and his agent said to Irvin take it so he did and the rest is a history. This stands the test of time, the best film he ever directed! I love John Williams score still the same, but I think John Williams changed the music score for a little bit, but that's just my opinion.Things that I love in this film: I love the battle with Rebels fighting with the Imperial AT-AT walkers on the ice world of Hoth. That is my favorite scene on ice world in the film. The Imperial AT-AT walkers are incredible well made with classic special effects.I love that the origins of Luke Skywalker are reveled, that Luke is the son of Darth Vader, who is actually Anakin Skywalker, before he become Darth Vader and went to the dark site.For the first time ever, we see an Emperor in a Hologram talking to Darth Vader.The Falcon with Han Solo, Princess Leia Organa, C-3PO and Chewbacca hiding in the rocks try's to eat a monster.Luke faces with Darth Vader him self face to face and get his arm cut off and then he jumps off the bridge, because he didn't want to join his father in a dark force. The lightsaber duel throughout the chamber between Luke and Darth Vader was excellent and it was epic.The training sequence with Luke and master Yoda were excellent and epic. A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back are my favorite films in series, that are in the franchise, this film get's a perfect 10 score for been the best sci-fi adventure sequel of all time."", ""The Rebellion has struck an important blow to the power of the Empire by destroying it's Death Star, however the power of the Dark Side of the Force remains strong and continues to hunt the rebellion. While the Rebellion base on Hoth is under treat, Luke has gone to a distant swamp planet to receive further Jedi training from Master Yoda. However the power of the dark side should not be underestimated and many dark truths are revealed as the threat of the Empire looms large.Following Star Wars was never going to be easy but this is actually better. Empire retains the same characters and the same sense of fun that the first had \x96 the battle on Hoth is just one of THE moments of the series. However what gets added to that is a much darker strand. The Empire is not beaten by the destruction of one ship \x96 it's power is barely dented in fact. This sees some startling revelations (I won't spoil it in case you've been living under a rock!) but also sees significant blows to the rebellion. In fact the ending of this film could not be more different from the end of Star Wars.Like the recent episode two this follows two strands \x96 the more pedestrian scenes with Luke and Yoda and the more action based scenes with Han and company. The scenes with Yoda add depth to the film and hint at the truth. Meanwhile the other half is a lot more action orientated and has comedy and good new characters such as Bobba Fett. The two work well together and come together well for a great finale. The addition of a dark strand to the film makes it all the better as it can be enjoyed as a story and not just a fun sci-fi film with good effects.The characters are better here than the first. The strong characters from the first (Han, C3P0 et al) are all still good here. However we also get a much more interesting version of Luke as he continues his journey into becoming a full Jedi. Yoda is a good addition (despite sounding like Fozzie Bear!) and Darth Vader becomes a lot more than just a good villain \x96 we learn his past, a revelation then, but a thing of common knowledge now.Overall this is as good as Star Wars at it's heart, but the darker nature of the film makes it much better. Where the first one was a victorious uprising this is, as the title suggests, the time in history where the Empire strikes back against the uprising. All the music, characters and things that make Star Wars Star Wars are here and it's simply one of the best of the series to date."", ""My five children were all pre-teens when 'The Empire Strikes Back' came to the theater. While there had been other Sci-Fi movies with a theme of conflict in outer space, the 'Star Wars' trilogy filled our imaginations like no other movies before them. The fantastic, strange worlds were presented almost like we were there too. Aliens sitting around a tavern, enjoying drinks and speaking in all sorts of languages. Nothing before had approached the sheer size of the space ships depicted here, huge cities traveling all over the galaxy. And how about the jump to hyper speed, then disappearing from the screen as the speed exceeds light speed! And the light sabres of the Jedi Knights. The Jedi Knights, a striking parallel to the Japanese Samurai.It is fruitless trying to argue 'which is best' in a trilogy, because the first one, in this case 'Star Wars', starts it all and has to be the 'father'. However, an argument can be made that 'The Empire Strikes Back' (now on DVD called Episode V) is overall a better-made movie which has more excitement, and grabs your imagination,than the other two original installments (now called parts IV and VI). The DVDs finally came out last month, and they are near perfect, as we should expect from Lucas Films and THX. The bit rate is high, and the picture is nothing short of superb. As is the Dolby EX surround track. My wife and I watched all three of the movies on DVD this week -- Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi -- compliments of our local public library. It was an appropriate reminder how good these movies are, and still ahead of their time. Nothing else has been made to compare to them."", ""`It avoids having the standard shoot-'em-up ending,' says a friend of mine, `by not having an ending.' I suppose this is what most people think, but all the same the film manages to form a satisfying whole; or at least, a whole that satisfies me. I'm therefore inclined to think it DOES have an ending. Obviously, I can't discuss this without giving things away to those few who don't know what happens. If you're one of those few, then believe me: your ignorance is precious enough to be worth guarding until you see the film. Stop reading now.After the surprise attack on the rebel base, Luke Skywalker splits with Han, Leia, et al. Han's party gets away first (is it just me, or is the shot of Luke watching the Falcon flying off while he stands stranded on the ground, a poignant one?), but thereafter they face one narrow escape after another, while Luke slinks off quietly and safely to train with Yoda.The training scenes are many and Yoda talks a great deal of rubbish. But somehow it doesn't matter. The film is ambivalent in its attitude towards Yoda, anyway. Our sympathy clearly lies with the entirely non-spiritual concerns of Han, Leia and the adolescent Luke. The main story concerns the understanding that builds between Han and Leia. In the end they are honest with one another; and if Han's being frozen and shipped back to Tatooine is the price to pay for this, well, it's the price to pay. It was very important NOT to end with the dashing rescue that opens `Return of the Jedi', which would be dramatically beside the point. Instead we end with the promise that the rescue will some day occur. That's enough.As for Luke: he abandons Yoda to rescue Han and Leia, and achieves NOTHING WHATEVER. This was my favourite touch. All five Jedis - Luke, Obi-Wan, Yoda, Vader, and the Emperor - find that their conflicting instincts are all entirely wrong. The film is really about the temporary triumph of human impulses over the mystical Force. Luke's human idealism is vindicated, but his supernatural powers, just this once, are not.When George Lucas gave his Star Wars trilogy a fresh coat of varnish in 1997 he felt he had to justify the expense by making needless changes. You'll notice he made precious few changes to episode V. There just wasn't room. He added a few extra shots of the ice monster, which of course weakened that one scene; but even with those changes in place the Special Edition is virtually identical to the original edition. Since Lucas was so keen on making changes wherever he could this is obviously a tribute to the tightness of the story and the direction. It's also a tribute to the perfection of the original special effects, more innovative than the effects in the first Star Wars movie and better than the effects in any subsequent one."", ""In a film like The Empire Strikes Back, especially a few years on the heels of such a mind-bogglingly great film like the original Star Wars, there is something that comes immediately to mind that would at first seem to count against the film, but instead only winds up increasing the respect that it commands. In the 1977 Star Wars, there is a clear reliance on simplicity in some parts. Obviously, it is much more than a simply made science fiction film, but like I said in my review of it, there was a lot of highly effective reliance on things that were not put on screen, such as Obi Wan's description of The Force to Luke. In The Empire Strike Back, the first thing that we are treated to is the traditional scrolling text along a background of stars, depicting what has happened between the last film and this one, and reminding us of the things that were mentioned in the last film but never explained.At first, this would almost seem to be a way to save money to get more information across to the audience without having to actually put it on screen, but this is really an ingenious way of furthering the story. The very fact that we are so willing to read all this information and forgive our inability to actually see it is a testament to the quality of the series, even at this early stage in its presentation, and we know the story so well from the first film that we are glad to see such a large change in what's happening in the films, not for a second lamenting the fact that we have obviously missed so much action. And besides that, if and when George Lucas runs out of new prequels to release, and maybe if he someday begins to run low on how many hundreds of millions of dollars he has, he could go right back and make these in-between scenes into full length films. What would he call these, if he did that? Introquels? Who cares! The names themselves would be interesting enough, and if you go back and read the stuff that introduces this film, it's obvious that there's an entire film there just waiting to be made. I guess the question of actors would be a formidable one, though.The Empire Strikes Back is the film where we are first introduced to the great Jedi master Yoda (`Away put your weapon!'), as well as some of the most thrilling battle sequences of the entire Star Wars series, and that includes the prequels. The battle scene where the rebels fight the Imperial Walkers on the ice planet is an incredibly well-made battle scene, not only in the way that it was put together so convincingly using models, but that the machines themselves are so creatively made. Indeed, the Imperial Walkers are some of the most recognizable machines from the entire Star Wars saga, right up there with the Millennium Falcon and the Death Star. I have just watched this film again, having already seen Episode I and Episode II, and not having seen any of the original Star Wars films for maybe 10 years (except for the original 1977 Star Wars, which I saw and reviewed a few days ago - and these aren't even the Special Edition versions!). When I first saw Yoda when watching The Empire Strikes Back again, I was really struck by how different he looked from in the newer movies. Obviously, he's completely computer generated in the new films, but here in Episode V he looks like a muppet! Even so, I would like to express my opinion that Yoda is more realistic and more interesting here as a puppet than in the newer films as a computer generated image. At least here in the older films you know that he's actually THERE, and that he's not just added into the film later.Oh yeah, speaking of Yoda, can I just complain for a minute? What the hell was up with the Jedi training? Yes, I realize that I'm just a lowly IMDb reviewer, while The Empire Strikes Back is a part of the greatest science fiction series of all time, but would it have killed George Lucas to write in a little more creative training for Luke? The thing that struck me first about the Star Wars films when I first started watching them was how incredibly imaginative they were, but then Luke started his training. You know, when I was in high school I played football. I was a wide receiver/tight end and I hardly ever got to play because I was too tall and too skinny, but part of my workout was to carry the linemen up and down the stairs to the weight room. Some of these guys weighed 100 pounds more than me, and I still almost never saw the field, and here's Luke Skywalker. He carries Yoda around this boggy swamp and he gets to be a Jedi! What the hell!There is also the addition of a surprisingly fitting love story. First of all, anyone who has ever read my review of a Jerry Bruckheimer movie will know that I am not the biggest fan of cramming a love story into a movie where it doesn't belong. I can't seem to write anything about Bruckheimer movies without complaining about the idiot love story, and now it's even worse because here's this movie that was made so long before, from which Bruckheimer could obviously have at least learned a LITTLE bit about how to do it right. Han Solo and Princess Leia maintain the personalities that they developed in the first Star Wars film and there is now a sort of love/hate relationship between the two of them, where neither one of them wants to admit their feelings for the other. This romantic subplot is characterized perfectly in the scene just before Solo is carbon frozen, when Leia risks approaching a cheesy romantic moment by saying `I love you' just before Han is lowered into the freezing chamber, and he saves the moment by responding, `I know.' Han Solo. Smart-ass to the last drop.Before I end I would like to point out that the goofs that can be found on the IMDb for this film are some of the most blatant that I've ever seen in a film. The scene where you can see someone giving a woman at the tactical maps a cue to deliver her lines is amazingly obvious, and some of the other ones, such as the stage hand swinging the light saber prop briefly into view as he switches it for an `off' prop with Luke just after he knocks Darth Vader over backwards, are just as much fun to look for. I have one question about the goofs, though. There's one where Luke looks off into the fog just after R2-D2 is eaten by the sea monster, and you can CLEARLY see a person running to the right a little ways off in the fog. Is that meant to be Luke? It seems that it's supposed to be him running in his search for R2, because you can even hear the FOOTSTEPS of the person running. I can't even IMAGINE how they could have missed THAT!!It is, however, a testament to the quality of a film when such tremendous oversights in editing do nothing to take away from the overall quality of the film. The Empire Strikes Back remains an extremely powerful and well-made installment in the Star Wars series, not taking even a single step backwards in the sheer breathtaking adventure of the original film. It's not often that a film as good as Star Wars can be released and then followed up with a sequel that is just as great, as is clearly the case here. Star Wars was a gigantic film upon its release, and with The Empire Strikes Back, Lucas has begun the formation of one of the greatest film series' in cinematic history."", ""So much amazing action and beautiful cinematography makes for such an enlightening experience! In The Empire Strikes Back you know who everyone is which is great plus Yoda is introduced! I love this movie the music is soothing, there's romance, more of Darth Vader, and introduces Emperor Palpatine what more can you ask for? A lot to relish and get excited about; it's such a classic gem."", 'SPOILERS Three years after ""Star Wars"", creator George Lucas released the second part of his trilogy. Giving scripting credits to Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasden, as well as directing to Irvin Kershner, Lucas made his smartest ever decision and as a result was able to release the finest film of the trilogy by a mile. Considerably darker and more mature than it\'s predecessor, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is a masterpiece of modern film. It is an intense, powerful, entertaining film with the ultimate cinema twist and with a script worthy of it\'s potential.After the events of the first film, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and Han Solo (Harrison Ford) are now members of the rebel alliance. Hidden on a frozen planet, the rebels hide from the domineering glow of the Empire. All is not well however as the evil Darth Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones) is on his way to find them.Easily the best of the trilogy, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" has so much going for it. A wonderful plot, an equally good script with some brilliant lines (even actor Harrison Ford joining in with a line or two of his own) and special effects to match, this film is a glowing example of why people love the trilogy so much.Since George Lucas passed on the major responsibilities for this film, we are given a more professional, well made film for our attention and Lucas\'s vision is better off for it. With it\'s recent remastering, it is also the only film in the trilogy to not be damaged by Lucas\' tampering. Extra images are added, graphics are honed, but nothing major is changed. As a result the film appears to us to be no different from it\'s original self.Darker and more mature as well, this sequel is better than the original ""Star Wars"" because it isn\'t so black and white. Presenting the evil Darth Vader as a more balanced individual, we don\'t quite have the confused Vader of the final chapter, but we are beginning to get signs that he isn\'t quite as we expected.This second part also gives us the finest performance ever by one of the universes most important characters. Still a rubber puppet with bendy ears, Jedi Master Yoda is introduced in this film as a creature of wit and intelligence. Voiced by Frank Oz, Yoda is brilliant because of his lines. Legendarily possessing of an obsession for splitting sentences up and rehashing them together, Yoda very often speaks normally throughout this film. Occasionally demonstrating his penchant for bad English, he does make a few minor errors, but ultimately it is up to the later scripts of George Lucas to corrupt Yoda\'s style and turn this wonderful character into an annoying figure of fun.There\'s no real way to fault ""The Empire Strikes Back"". The finest part of the original trilogy, this film is amazing because it is professionally done. Nobody would ever deny that George Lucas did something wonderful when he thought up ""Star Wars"", but unfortunately for a lot of the films, Lucas always insisted on too much control. A dire writer of scripts, Lucas can destroy his films by making them infuriating to watch. In this part though, Lucas didn\'t get involved and as a result, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is a masterpiece in it\'s own right.', ""The original trilogy of Star Wars contain three films, all of which are sophisticated, imaginative and enormous fun. I feared it wouldn't be my thing, but it was exactly that. I loved the original trilogy for all those reasons. Empire Strikes Back maintains all the fun of its predecessor, while even darker and more mature. Visually it's a marvel to look at, with the stunning special effects and highly imaginative-looking sets. John Williams's score is just outstanding, epic and monumental in every way. The story is darker than that of New Hope and perhaps more sophisticated, and I loved the fact the filmmakers made the romance between Leia and Han more developed. The battle sequences are mesmerising, the beginning is bound to have you on the edge of your seat, but the battle between Luke and Darth Vader was simply out of this world. The script is still as affectionate as ever, the pace is fast and the acting is great. Mark Hamill is ever as likable as Luke, and Carrie Fisher still has her spunk and vivacity. Harrison Ford is noticeably more subdued, but he is still terrific, and Frank Oz is a perfect Yoda. Chewabacca is hilarious, and Darth Vader is a fantastic villain, especially when voiced so magnificently by James Earl Jones. All in all, a perfect successor to an already brilliant first film. 10/10 Bethany Cox"", '(Note: This review contains some spoilers.)Movie novelty quickly wears thin, which is why so many sequels pale in comparison to their originals. ""Star Wars: Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back"" is the best of the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy, darker and deeper and even more powerful than the first film. Granted, the original pioneered an endless saga of imitators and somewhat imaginative knock-offs, and is still one of the greatest films ever made, but ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is a tiny inch ahead in the race.It is the dark middle chapter in an almost perfect trilogy, crammed full with imagination and special effects. It is simply one of the most visionary movies of all time, which is rare for a sequel -- any sequel -- especially in the case of a sci-fi film. Just take a look at ""Predator 2"" for an example of an idea running out of steam, or a director who cannot cope with his script.The film generally picks up where the last left off: Luke (Mark Hamill) saved the day by blowing up the Death Star, the heroes were awarded with medals by the princess (Carrie Fisher), and peace was temporarily restored. But Darth Vader (voice of James Earl Jones) is still alive, and the Emperor\'s fury grows stronger as Luke begins his Jedi training under the help of Yoda. Meanwhile, Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Leia flee to Cloud City to escape an attack from the empire, where they are taken under the wing of Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), an old pal of Han\'s who is secretly working for Vader, somewhat against his own will.The movie is strong in its morals and Biblical metaphors, just as the original. Luke is the savior, Calrissian could be considered the equivalent of Judas, Han Solo is one of Luke\'s good disciples and Vader represents pure evil. And of course, there\'s the truly iconic line, ""I am your father,"" that is relevant to the devil, who -- according to the scriptures -- was an angel before being cast into the bowels of hell and becoming Lucifer. Lucas admittedly used these various metaphors to strike a nerve in the subconscious of his viewers. Like all good fables, of fantasy or reality, ""Star Wars"" is a trilogy that relates to just about everyone, in one form or another, and is -- at its roots -- a story we are all very familiar with. It is the ever-familiar notion of good-vs. -evil at its core that helps propel these movies into the hearts of many. Yes, ""Star Wars"" is the quintessential nerd\'s film, engulfed in an entirely different dimension, but the film\'s bad rap for this is undeserved -- it\'s still a wonderful story, and you don\'t have to be a die-hard fan to appreciate its fine points (and it has many).One of the most popular legends (and misconceptions) regarding the ""Star Wars"" phenomenon is that George Lucas helmed the entire Star Wars trilogy, when in fact he only directed the first and wrote the screenplay for all three combined. ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is directed by Irvin Kirshner, who also delivered us the disappointing ""RoboCop 2."" How could one sequel be so great, and the other so bad? Simple: Kirshner\'s darkness in ""The Empire Strikes Back"" had a point, and a high value. In ""RoboCop 2,"" it was just excessive and silly, not to mention totally unnecessary. What Paul Verhoeven was able to do with the original ""RoboCop"" was something not many films can accomplish, and Kirshner tried to add on to this with a darker narrative, which only ended in a frustratingly empty motion picture.""The Empire Strikes Back"" has a point amidst the action, and is the most important of all three ""Star Wars"" movies. It has the famous introduction of the creature Yoda, who sits tucked away in his hut on a swamp planet, at first startling Luke with his strange features, and then with his subtle wisdom. It is Yoda who trains Luke in the ways of the Jedi, and eventually leads him towards his destination: The showdown with Vader, when the infamous secret is finally revealed.The movie is expertly crafted, both in terms of a a narrative and literal context. From beginning to end it is darker, fiercer and more powerful than the original film, which is not an easy feat. All trilogies have their dark areas, and this is usually the middle chapter (""Back to the Future Part II"" is a good example), yet in ""The Empire Strikes Back"" the darkness seems very appropriate given the material. It is a film that dwells long and hard on betrayal, murder, revenge, and unrecoverable mistakes. By the end of the movie, we know what Luke is feeling: There is still much to be done, despite an overwhelming emotional downpour of attachment and confusion. For us, as an audience, we know everything must come to an end within the next installment. For Luke, it could be an eternity of struggle. But we all know there will be an end to the epic saga, and we have always known this, ever since we first caught a glimpse of a younger, more innocent Luke working for his uncle on that deserted planet, so many years ago, when he could only dream of having adventures in other galaxies far, far away...5/5 stars.John Ulmer', 'That\'s what I called this when I was too small to reach the movies in my house. My poor mother had to decipher that description.Just as important as A New Hope was to movies, Empire Strikes Back is to sequels. And why? Because Lucas paid for this himself. No one has ever been in his position before. To make huge movies that are financed by the creator. No studio would ever allow a movie like this, it took risks: It\'s not a rehash, its darker, a realistic puppet was a serious main character and a lot of the story is left in the air.But while this movie is darker than it\'s predecessor it\'s not a dark movie, its just darker. People seem to forget that. It\'s a more serious story but it\'s still able to maintain the fun feel of 4. It also continues the speed from 4 as well. Instead of getting in huge fights they are just small scuffles. This doesn\'t feel for a second that it\'s trying to outdo the original. The story and the characters are expanded and deepened.Yoda was a huge risk, it\'s hard for us to think of a puppet not being taken seriously, but no one had ever attempted to make a life like puppet before. And sequels weren\'t a sure cash in either. In order for this movie to break even it had to be the most successful sequel of all time. It\'s these things that Lucas gave us. He not only knows how to tell a story and make a great movie but he takes risks to do it at the same time. He did this his whole career. If this movie failed not only was Star Wars dead but so was Lucas\' career. That\'ll motivate you.My favorite SW set is in this, the carbon freezing chamber. I don\'t know if it\'s the steam, the orange light or the vastness but I love this room. Everyone looks cool here. Especially the Stormtroopers, their white really illuminates the orange well. And you get Vader and Boba in here too.The snow troopers are very cool. I can\'t figure out if I like them or the Episode 3 clones best.Lando is a great addition because he\'s the Han that could have been. And Lando gets crap for being bad but he really does make the best call. He appeases Vader to save his life while still giving himself the freedom to save Han in the end. And he hasn\'t seen Han in years maybe he\'s become a real , the last time he saw him he was a smuggler after all. And Billy Dee is great, I don\'t know if anyone is as effortlessly smooth as this guy.3P0 in pieces is a great addition that provides endless jokes.I love Han\'s love story with Leah because she\'s given him no indication that she\'s interested. And he acts like they have this dating history. But he is right because she does want him.And the best part of the movie: Yoda/training. Not only is Yoda the most powerful Jedi of all but you hang on his every word of wisdom. Lines repeated for my entire life. I have always loved the fact that the most powerful Jedi was the smallest. There\'s just something about that idea that really gets me.And there\'s really something to be said for the fact that Yoda is not actually real. We all know that Frank Oz did the voice and puppeteered Yoda but the fact that Yoda is not actually real really helps to make his character real. it\'s not necessarily Frank Oz as Yoda, what you see is the little green puppet as Yoda. There aren\'t pictures of him at studio 54 or news of him getting married. Yoda is Yoda. when he is not being the puppet on screen he doesn\'t exist which really helps to his reality.The biggest complaint since Lucas finished the saga was that ""I am your father,"" is now not a surprise any more. Which is true, you do know, but watching them in order you\'ll probably be surprised that Anakin turns to the dark side. And it might be a surprise that Vader tells Luke this because as far as we know Vader doesn\'t know who Luke is. He doesn\'t even know that he has a kid. And we think that Anakin is dead. I don\'t know... Only time will tell with people who watch these in episode order', ""The Empire Strikes Back is the best film in the original Star Wars trilogy. It has all the great qualities that the original Star Wars has: great effects (at the time of its release), appealing characters, and lots of spellbinding action. It also has eliminated some of the problems that plagued the first: the storyline is tighter, and goes much deeper into character development. The performances are terrific, especially by Harrison Ford as Han Solo, and Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian. George Lucas has also remembered to include a spellbinding battle sequence with the snowspeeder sequence near the beginning of the film. The conclusion, with a lightsaber duel between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker, is truly one of the most suspenseful and dramatic scenes in the entire series. This is a truly wondrous film, and serves as a constant reminder that just because a movie is expensive and a blockbuster doesn't mean that it has to be shallow and two dimensional. This film will undoubtedly entertain viewers of all ages from start to finish."", ""''Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back '' is my favorite one from all the star war series.Things are getting more and more complicated for the Rebels.Spite of the fact that the Death Star was destroyed, the Imperial troops had success expelling the Rebels from their secret base, and now they are being hunted in all galaxy. The new secret base is localized in Hoth, a very cold world even for the native animals. Darth Vader wants to find Luke at any cost, and now he sent many remote probes to find him in all space. Luke is attacked by a big animal and almost dies, by stays lost in the ice. He sees the ghost of Obi Wan Kenobi talking with him, and he says that Luke needs to go to a system called Dangoba, where Yoda will teach and explain to him all the steps to become a Jedi. Han Solo goes after Luke and they both are saved by their rebel team.The system Hoth is discovered by the Empire(since it should not have any human form living in there) and consequently the Rebel Base. Darth Vader decides to attack the Rebels by the surface,and the Rebels really stay in disadvantage. Han,Leia,C3pO and Chewbacca escapes from Hoth,but after many attacks from the Imperial troops and even asteroids fields, they arrive in the Cloud city that Lando,an old friend of Han,rules.Luke goes with R2 to Dangoba,and there he finds Yoda. The problem is, Yoda does not want to teach him how to become a Jedi,since he finds Luke extremely impatient, old to be trained and also with many anger inside of him,like his father Anakin. Obi Wan tries to change Yoda's mind, but only when Luke promises to really gives his best that Yoda accepts the challenge.The Emperor talks to Vader about a disturbance in the force that comes from Luke Skywalker. He finally says that Luke is son of Anakin and that Luke should never be trained as a Jedi,because of the risk in destroying the siths,that are very high. But Vader has other plans: He always imagined that his offspring died when Padme died, and now he thinks about making Luke a sith,to they both rule the galaxy together and also kill the Emperor.In the city of the clouds, Lando betrays Han and gives them all to Vader.It's all a trap to take Luke that Vader did, and while he tortures Han, Lukes see the vision of his friends suffering,and gave up his training. Yoda alerts him that the risk of turning to the dark side is high, and that he should not stop his training, but Luke is so worried with his friends that he cannot think about anything else. Vader call the award hunters and Boba Fett(the clone of Jango Fett,remember?)is the one who takes Han Solo to Jabba,to win a big prize.We are now in a risky situation, where Lukes needs to confront his dad without be tainted to the dark side, and someone needs to help Han,Chewbacca,Leia and C3po.Ps: *In this movie we can see the first demonstrations that Leia and Han likes each other,and when Leia wants to let Han with jealous and kisses Luke is kind of a funny moment. Another nice moment with Leia, is when we see the connection between her and Luke, when he has his hand cut and is in a dangerous situation after fighting with Vader.*I really like the big Imperial robots called 'walkers': I think they are one of the most impressive artilleries the Empire has."", ""An excellent sequel to Star Wars, this is easily the darkest and most serious out of all the Star Wars films, at least until Revenge of the Sith comes out. This movie benefits from the introduction of Yoda, a diminutive yet wise Jedi master who helps Luke prepare for his showdown with Darth Vader. It also introduces Lando Calrissian, Han's old gambling and smuggling buddy played very well by Billy Dee Williams. Empire is more character driven than the original and relies more on comic relief to help lighten the mood, but it doesn't go overboard with the humor. The story is more refined and the acting is better as well. Despite all of this I can't really say that I enjoyed Empire more than the original. The original Star Wars has a certain charm to it that none of the sequels (or prequels) have captured. I'd say that it is at least on par with the original though and is a fitting follow up in what is probably the greatest series of movies in the history of cinema."", 'The sequel to Star Wars is argueably the best of all the Star Wars films.This is much darker than the 1st one.Look for the Super Star Destroyer,it is a awesome ship.Boba Fett makes his fist appearence here.The chase scene the M.Falcon is being chased down by the Star Destroyers and Tie Fighters is really a cool scene.I f you like the 1st Star Wars then you will love this one!Note: The special edition has added scenes,special effects,sounds,and creatures. To ME the highlight of this special edition is seeing the Wampa monster!', 'The rebels\' new base is hidden in the icy planet Hoth and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) commands a unit with Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew). During the investigation of a meteor crash, Luke is wounded and captured by a creature but succeeds to escape. While dying on the snow, he has a vision of Obi-Wan Kenobi telling him to go to the Dagobah system to be trained by the Jedi Master Yoda. Later he is saved by Han and they are rescued in the morning by the rebels. Meanwhile Darth Vader (David Prowse) sends probe droids through the galaxy to find the location of the base. The rebels are located and they need to leave the planet under the attack of the Imperial Fleet. However Luke heads to Dagobah to find Yoda while Leia, Han, Chewbacca and C-3PO travel to the planet Bespin to meet his friend Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) and repair the Millennium Falcon. However, they are betrayed by Lando and captured by Darth Vader. Meanwhile Luke has a premonition with his friends in danger and he decides to interrupt his training with Yoda to save them, despite the warning of Obi-Wan and Yoda. Will Luke be ready to face Darth Vader and save his friends? ""The Empire Strikes Back"", later retitled ""Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back"" is a fantastic sequel of Star Wars, with a great story. The plot has adventure, romance, comedy and betrayal and is engaging until the very end. The characters now are more experienced and bonded. The mannerisms of C-3PO recalls Dr. Smith, from ""Lost in Space"". This is the type of sequel that keeps the high quality of the original film. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""O Império Contra-Ataca"" (""The Empire Strikes Back"")', ""Congratulations have to go to line producer Gary Kurtz and director Irvin Kershner in pushing the production to out-perform A New Hope, even though the consequence was a film that came in massively over budget, and almost cost Lucas his hard fought independence from the Hollywood system.The plot moves quickly, from an interesting script by Leigh Bracket and Larry Kasdan, focusing on exploring two key relationships. The first is the relationship between Han Solo and Leia Organa, which is touched upon in a New Hope, but is fleshed out more in this film. The other is the more central relationship between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker. This relationship is also linked in to the main supporting character in this film, Yoda, who is fantastically well realised by the film crew and performed brilliantly by Frank Oz. There are other characters, but whereas C3P0 and R2D2 were a central part of the story in the previous film, they are more on the sidelines.What makes this film so great though is the involving and effective way the relationships operate within the broader story. The banter between Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher is highly effective and amusing, operating through the classical love-hate relationship. One senses that Kershner, as a director of character driven films, worked very effectively with the actors and gave them the space to develop their characters which meant plenty of choices for the director in terms of their performances. The same goes for Mark Hamill's interaction with Yoda(Frank Oz). This is totally convincing and builds up the confrontation with Darth Vader very well. It was time well spent in getting these performances right. Kershner is very good at keeping the performance naturalistic, but reduces the level of broadness in the characters, making them more complex and interesting. Darth Vader benefits from this with scenes in the film that add to the mystique of the character. The confrontation with Luke Skywalker is riveting and dramatic and elevates the film above the level of its predecessor. Technically the film is even more impressive than its predecessor. Credit has to go the Oscar nominated Art Direction team. John Barry, who had worked on the previous film, passed away during the production, but Norman Reynolds led the team superbly, with the excellent creations of Dagobah and Hoth, albeit Bespin in the original does feel a bit like a set, and the digital embellishments in the special edition were helpful in creating a bigger feel to those scenes. However, I was disappointed in the reworked scene with Palpatine in the special edition - while putting the excellent Ian McDiarmid was supporting continuity, to show him face on was, in my view an error and the reworked scene would have played much better with his face shrouded, or at the least partially obscured. The whole point of the scene was that the dialogue as strong enough without the need to ram an unsubtle visual at the audience. Editing is excellent, led by Star Wars veteran Paul Hirsch, but it is known that both George Lucas, and his then wife Marcia were also heavily involved in putting the film together. Peter Suschitzky's photography is more conventional and low key in approach than A New Hope, but is particularly effective on the Dagobah scenes in Elstree Studios, and the location scenes in Norway. ILM's visual effects were outstanding, and rightly won an Academy Award. The crew consisted of the following: Oscar winning A New Hope veteran Richard Edlund, working with British effects supervisor Brian Johnson (who had just won an Oscar for Alien), effects photographer Dennis Muren (who would become an award winning and digital effects pioneer for ILM for ET, Return of the Jedi, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Innerspace, The Abyss, T2 and Jurassic Park) and compositor Bruce Nicholson, who would go on to win an Oscar for his work on Raiders of the Lost Ark, and work on a wide variety of films in Hollywood. George Lucas took a strong interest and influence in the special effects and also has to take credit for some of the excellent sequences in the film, which also work because they help drive the story along. Again, like a New Hope, sound work was first rate and Oscar winning. In most cases the sound has to be recorded in a studio and added many months after filming has been completed. Sound re-recordist Bill Varney would win another Oscar for Raiders of the Lost Ark. Steve Maslow and Gregg Landaker also worked as sound-recordists and are both prolific contributors to many high profile movies. They would also win Oscars for their work on Raiders and then some fourteen years later win again for their work on the Keanu Reeves hit movie Speed. Peter Sutton won for his on–set work and has a large body of work in film since this movie. Also credit has to go the Ben Burtt's sound design work, which creates a fabulous sound-scape for the film.However, despite the above outstanding technical contributions, which serve to enhance and exciting and interesting story, it is composer John Williams who, yet again, takes this film to another level with another astounding musical score. Working with the director and producers, Williams develops and expands original themes. He creates a new and unforgettable theme for Darth Vader, with strong militaristic overtones, and clever themes for Leia and Han, and for Yoda. He weaves the score into the film expertly, giving moments of tension, excitement, thoughtfulness, mystery and tragedy with aplomb. The score feels more operatic than a New Hope, and helps cement this as one of the best adventure/fantasy films ever made. Congratulations to Mr Lucas for delivering a remarkable sequel, but also to Gary Kurtz and Irvin Kershner for having the courage to push everyone out of their comfort zones so as to reach this level of excellence."", ""After the destruction of the Death Star, the Rebel Alliance has been hounded by the Empire.

Meanwhile, Luke goes to the Dagobah system and finds Jedi Master Yoda.There are superior popcorn movies in the Star Wars franchise although there is plenty of eye-popping action in this one. This is the best overall film in the series. The dialog is snappier. The combative romance between Leia and Han is the best. Everything looks great. It introduces Yoda and Lando. There are great legendary twists. It is a Star Wars movie for film fans. Even the Special Edition is the best of the original trio. There may be one or two stiff additions but most of them actually help. There are so many incredible moments in this."", ""This film changed the game forever. The people behind the scenes took an exciting science fiction adventure film with a happy tone where the heroes have a happy tone throughout and throwing that on its side. Throughout the film the rebels are in a constant rush and panic, pushing the viewers to the edge of their seat wondering if the heroes would make it to the end okay. This is done brilliantly by splitting up the heroes putting them in a worried state for one another. As well as that the rebels are all tested as they go through their own personal trails and try to find their way through. Even though this might put you on a constant worry for the characters the movie is paced perfectly with breathers and amazing storytelling by the characters to fill in anything we need answers for. That is just the story, the film also has gorgeous cinematography, going from the AT-ATs on Hoth, to the Imperial pursuit of the Falcon through the asteroid field, all the way down to the beautiful shots of the final battle in Cloud city. Even though we as viewers are worried for the rebels, the imagery is jaw dropping. The imagery is further enhanced by the most popular score of all time, John Williams delivers his best work ever as it has stuck with people their entire lives and is recognizable by even those who haven't seen the film. The film was released in 1980 and all of the set design and special effects still hold up to this day as they are just as convincing now as it was apon first watch for everyone in the past 38 years."", ""From it's opening scenes on the bleak ice-ball that is the planet Hoth, to its exciting finale on the cloud city of Bespin, The Empire Strikes back is a worthy sequel to the magnificent Star Wars. Taking over the directorial reins from George Lucas, Irvin Kershner steers the movie into darker territory to deliver a more mature movie than its predecessor.The Empire is still licking its wounds after the destruction of the Death Star, and evil Darth Vader is intent on finding the rebels responsible for destroying his new toy. Luke's aim, meanwhile, is to become a fully fledged Jedi knight, whilst Han sets himself a more difficult target: he plans on getting into Leia's knickers.With more incredible FX packed action scenes than you can shake a light-sabre at (highlights include the fantastic battle on Hoth, a chase scene through an asteroid field, and the Luke/Darth light-sabre duel), and THAT moment where we learn the truth about Luke's father, it's no surprise to find that this episode is often said to be the best of the series. Personally, A New Hope will always be my favourite (for sentimental reasons), but The Empire Strikes Back is a very close second."", 'I cannot believe some people out there didn\'t like this film, yet claim to have enjoyed Episode One. No comparison whatsoever. ""The Empire Strike Back"" is George Lucas\' best contribution to human history, and it will be remembered long after most other science fiction films have gone the way of the Do-Do Bird. The optical effects still stand the test of time, and the acting is superb. Harrison Ford, Mark Hamil and Carrie Fisher are all better than they we in the original Star Wars, having fully developed and grown into their characters, and the story just keeps going and going, from asteroid fields to swamp planets to cities in the sky, everything in this film works.

But this one is best! It was the most exciting, it kept you on the edge of your seat and your mind the whole way through. Although, I have to say, Lucas has become very lazy in the Star Wars saga since the Phantom Menace, which was quite poor. This is vintage Lucas and this your vintage space movie. Star Wars (any of the original 3 and Episode 3) is a must see! It includes many household names. Some, though, hate Star Wars with a vengeance. Those people lack in creativity and are subject to boring, lack-luster films. All I can say is have fun because I know you won't for missing out on this 5-star, one of a kind classic.

Billy Dee Williams is a welcome addition in a effortlessly charismatic performance. John Williams' musical score is perfect once again. It's expertly paced and Irvin Kershner's direction is incredible. The action sequences are extremely thrilling and it has the best lightsaber fight in the franchise so far, in my opinion. It also has one the greatest twists of all time."", 'The SonI am convinced that movies are about other movies more than life. The original ""Star Wars"" was a success in my opinion because it had three things: \x97 a collection of images from other films, distinctly referencing them. Some were film- schoolish like the Kurosawa quotes. But most were like what Kurosawa himself referenced: already deeply embedded visual touchstones, not having lost their power in becoming clichés. These were collected in one large form, the Flash Gordan form let\'s call it, which all of us slightly knew. It could be recalled with enough familiarity to register but not enough to set expectations, so Lucas could fill the bucket with whatever he found and liked.\x97 a notion of a complete, understandable cosmology. Its the noir notion that laws of the universe exist and cannot be seen, and if they could they wouldn\'t be comprehensible. This notion is deep in film, so deep that when a movie comes along that posits a cosmology that is whole, and revealable, it shocks. What that movie did was give us enough of a glimpse into this to believe that we could understand the world, at least THIS world of the ""galaxy far away."" Remember when that original came out? The images were impressible, but what people talked about wasn\'t what they saw, but about how the world worked. It settled first in an ersatz religion among geeky kids and now has been swallowed by the ""simple"" US religions, and its presidential representative.\x97 the notion of a quest. Its an old form, but cast in the above noted situation, it takes new power. The traditional form, the Goethe-Lytton form was there to remind and reveal mysteries. Here it is clearer, to explain. There was a lowbrow professor at the time of a women\'s college that a TeeVee interviewer made popular. It was sort of a metaquest. This simple man said that we could actually understand the nature of trying to understand nature. It was a lucky break for Lucas, because it meshed with this shocking notion of a grand cosmology that we know our hero (check out the name: ""sky walker"") will grasp, master and show us.That was the first film. A huge success, just huge. It did change many things, but from my perspective the key thing was how it reset that great American invention of noir, as important as jazz, and liberty which form a sort of trilogy of contradictory, three-way tension.Okay. Now the second big Ted idea, the necessity for the equal size of steps in abstraction when you have two steps. It seems this is hardwired in the brain, a sort of human quantum mechanics. If you look back along the abstraction, say a cartoon in a cartoon, the distance between the two will be precisely the same as the surrounding cartoon.So, when they made the second Star Wars movie, they could reference the previous one in the way that it referenced its cinematic background. It had a writer in Kasden who knew how to do this. And it had a director in Lucas\' film school teacher who did also. Neither had a huge hit other than this because it was such a cool setup, having such a thing to build on.You\'ll read lots about trying to humanize, and how faces were used. But all that is simply in the service of abstracting closer to us from the original, in equal portion. This is the son. Why did the franchise fail after this? Because there was no step left to abstract to and maintain the brand.(This comment is a replacement of one deleted for unknown reasons. This was requested by a reader.)Ted\'s Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.', 'Although called ""Episode V,"" this was second movie in the Star Wars 6-part installment and I\'ve always thought one of the better entries in the series.If you watch the first Star Wars and then this one, you\'ll immediately see a vast improvement in the special-effects department. There is a much more polished look to this one, and improved sound In fact, the DVD transfer is outstanding considering the age of this film.While the first Star Wars was a bit subdued, this one picks up the action right from the start, although lulls are really appreciated because the first 40 minutes are pretty hectic. The most notable of those scenes are the gigantic robots which were awesome when this film first came out, and are still pretty good. The movie calms down after that opening land war but retains the viewer\'s interest with other things.The second half of the movie features two stories going on at once: the battle in space with most of the cast involved, and ""Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) in a swampland involved in his training sessions with the Master Yoda.Some of the movie\'s dialog is still corny, especially between Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) with their love-hate relationship, but it\'s not overdone. What is overdone is constant bleating noises emanating from ""Chewbacca,"" the wookie. That sheep-in-heat noise can get annoying after awhile. The ""Rambo"" action continues as it did in the first film, with the villains firing everything at our heroes and never hitting them. Ludicrous, but part of the deal. Those things you just put up with as the film, overall, delivers another interesting adventure, far more than the first Star Wars and leading up to the next one, which was even better.', 'In this sequel to the previous Star Wars movie, Episode IV: A New Hope, the opening crawl reveals that after the destruction of the Death Star, the Rebels were forced to evacuate their base on the Yavin moon and the dreaded Imperial Fleet of the Galactic Empire has pursued the Rebel Alliance across the galaxy, forcing them to establish a secret base on the remote ice planet Hoth. Dark Lord of the Sith Darth Vader (David Prowse/voice: James Earl Jones) sends robotic probes in search of the base and its commander and hero, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).While Luke is patrolling near Echo Base, he sees what looks like a meteor hitting the ground near his location. He reports to Han Solo that he plans to investigate the fallen object but before he can ride his mount to the site, he\'s knocked unconscious by an indigenous, polar bear-like predator, the wampa. Back at the base, the smuggler-pilot Han Solo (Harrison Ford) announces his intention to leave the Rebels and pay the debt he owes to the gangster Jabba the Hutt, much to the displeasure of Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher). After Han discovers that Luke has not returned from patrol and with the temperature dropping rapidly, he delays his departure and leaves the base to search for him on an ostrich-like creature called a tauntaun.Meanwhile, Luke escapes the wampa\'s lair, using the Force to retrieve his nearby light saber and wounding the beast, but is overcome by the cold outside. He sees an apparition of his late mentor, Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness), who instructs him to receive training from Jedi Master Yoda (voice: Frank Oz) on the planet Dagobah. Han finds Luke and gives him shelter, using his own tauntaun\'s carcass to keep Luke warm, until he can build a sturdier shelter. The two are rescued the following morning by a Rebel patrol. Luke is taken to the medical bay to heal from the wounds he received from the Wampa. In his recovery room he\'s met by Leia, Han and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew). Han jovially reminds Luke that he\'s rescued him twice from certain danger.Sometime later, when ground scans detect an object outside the base perimeter at Zone 12, Han and Chewie, investigate, and find an Imperial probe droid that transmits the location of the Rebel base to the Imperial fleet before firing upon Chewie. Han hits the droid with a low-energy blast but the droid activates a self-destruct function and explodes. On the bridge of Darth Vader\'s massive flagship, the droid\'s transmission is picked up by Captain Piett, but his superior, fleet Admiral Ozzel, dismisses the message until Vader sees the transmission and realizes it is the Rebel base. He overrules Ozzel and orders the Imperial Fleet to the Hoth system.Later, as the Fleet emerges from hyperspace, Vader is informed by his infantry commander, General Veers, that the Rebels have set up infantry trenches and a powerful energy shield to protect them from the Empire\'s orbital bombardment. Ordering Veers to launch a surface attack, Vader is furious that Ozzel has clumsily given away the element of surprise by bringing his ship out of light speed too close to the planet, and he communicates this displeasure to Captain Piett as he promotes him to admiral while Ozzel is given Vader\'s own fatal brand of reprimand.On the surface, the Imperial forces land their ground assault troops, a unit of over a dozen four-legged AT-AT ""walkers"" (along with a few dozen two-legged AT-ST walkers) beyond the energy shield and Luke leads his squadron of flying speeders into battle. Realizing that their blasters cannot damage the heavily armored walkers, Luke devises an attack plan that has his squad using their towing cables to bind the legs of the walkers to trip them, making them more vulnerable. A few walkers are destroyed but the Imperial forces eventually overpower the Rebels and destroy the generator powering the energy shield, capturing the Rebel base. Han Solo, Princess Leia, Chewbacca, and their droid C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) flee on board the Millennium Falcon. Luke makes it back to the base after personally destroying one of the walkers and speeds off in his X-Wing fighter with astromech droid R2-D2 (Kenny Baker).In space, Han discovers that the Falcon\'s hyper-drive is damaged and it cannot escape the Imperial blockade in space. During the confusion, they enter the nearby Hoth asteroid field, pursued by four Imperial TIE-Fighters; Han Solo pilots the Millennium Falcon deeper into the field, and the four pursuing fighters are destroyed by the flying rocks. Han lands the Falcon inside a crater on one of the larger asteroids to hide and make repairs.Meanwhile, Luke and R2-D2 make a crash landing on the swamp planet of Dagobah. Frustrated at his X-Wing having landed in a bog, Luke makes camp and begins to eat his rations. Luke muses about how the surrounding area seems familiar when he\'s startled by a strange voice behind him, a wizened, green little creature who acts obnoxiously, demanding to keep a small power lamp of Luke\'s and criticizes the rations Luke eats. Telling Luke that he knows where to find Yoda, Luke goes to his small house to eat. While there, Luke quickly grows impatient, wanting to meet Yoda immediately. The small creature begins to talk to the spirit of Obi-Wan, saying that Luke is too old to begin Jedi training and that he hasn\'t learned the patience a Jedi requires. Luke realizes that the creature is Yoda himself. Yoda insists that Luke harbors much anger like his father, Anakin. Obi-Wan assures Yoda that Luke will learn patience and will complete his training. Luke tells Yoda that he is not afraid, to which Yoda gravely replies, ""You will be.""The Star Destroyer \'Avenger\' moves through the massive asteroid field, searching for the Millennium Falcon. A group of TIE Bombers moves across the massive asteroid where the Falcon is hiding, and they release high-yield concussion bombs on the surface, trying to scare out the Falcon. The noise awakens Leia, who has fallen asleep in the cockpit.Inside the asteroid cave, Han Solo and Princess Leia argue while repairing the ship, eventually leading to a tender kiss. At the same time, Vader orders the Star Destroyer \'Avenger\' to continue searching the asteroid field for the Falcon, despite it\'s captain\'s assumptions that the ship was destroyed. Vader later confers with the powerful Galactic Emperor Palpatine, about a new threat to the Empire - Luke Skywalker. Darth Vader suggests that if Luke could be turned, he would become a great ally to the Imperial cause. The Emperor asks, \'Can it be done?\'; Vader simply replies, \'He will join us, or die, my Master\'.While resting in the Falcon\'s cockpit, Leia is scared by an ugly creature on the ship\'s windows. Han, Leia and Chewbacca all venture outside the ship in breathing masks to investigate. Leia notices that the ground has a strange consistency and Han suddenly shoots one of the beasts Leia saw off the ship. As he suspected, they are mynocks, parasitic creatures feeding on the Falcon\'s power cables. When Chewie tries to shoot one and misses, the whole cave rocks with a loud rumble. Suspicious, Han shoots the ground and the cave becomes more unstable. As they board the ship and race out they see that the mouth of the cave is actually the jaws of a titanic space slug. Han manages to escape as the creature takes another hungry snap at the ship.On the bridge of the Avenger, Darth Vader gathers a small group of intergalactic bounty hunters, the most feared of whom is Boba Fett (Jeremy Bulloch). Vader promises them a large payoff if they can find the Millennium Falcon.In space once again, the Falcon is again chased by a Star Destroyer, but Han evades pursuit cleverly and stealthily: after soaring into an attack position, he flies directly over the bridge of the star destroyer and hides the Falcon on the massive ship\'s surface, attaching to it with the Falcon\'s landing claws. They go undetected while Han figures out an escape plan. He surmises that the fleet will dump their refuse before jumping to hyperspace and they can float away unnoticed. Han checks his navigational log and realizes he\'s been in the area before and that a planet called Bespin is nearby and that they\'ll find one of his old smuggling buddies there who will offer them refuge. Unfortunately, their escape is not unanticipated; following just behind him is a smaller ship, Slave I, piloted by Fett who is working out where the Millennium Falcon is likely going. Han\'s escape plan works and he sets course for Cloud City, a gas mining colony on the nearby gas planet of Bespin, which is run by Han\'s friend, Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams).On Dagobah, Luke undergoes Yoda\'s rigorous lessons about the metaphysical nature of the Force involving levitating objects, performing acrobatic feats and meditation to promote calm and see possible visions of the future. Yoda brings Luke to an old, gnarled tree that sits atop a cave. Yoda tells his apprentice that the cave is powerful with the dark side of the Force and that Luke must explore it. Somewhat distrusting of his master, Luke takes his light saber with him. Inside the cave, Luke encounters a vision of Darth Vader, whom he fights. Luke cuts off Vader\'s head with his light saber, but then the mask bursts open, revealing Luke\'s own face behind it. The cave is another test, one that carries a warning for Luke to control his impulses and anger or he\'ll end up like Vader himself.Luke has a vision of Han and Leia in danger and agony. Luke wants to rescue them, but Yoda and the ghost of Obi-Wan warn of the dangers of rashly leaving, because Luke is still susceptible to the powerful temptation of the Dark Side. Nevertheless, Luke departs from Dagobah and promises Yoda he will return to complete his training.Upon their arrival at Cloud City, Han\'s party is welcomed by Lando Calrissian. After agreeing to help Han repair his ship, Lando invites him and the others to a meal. C3PO is distracted from the group when he hears the familiar beeping of an R2 unit. Entering a small room, he is suddenly confronted by an unseen person why he\'s in the room. A laser blast cuts C3PO down as he babbles to his attackers. Only Chewbacca is suspicious, but he arrives on the scene too late to see what happened.When Han\'s party enter the dining room, they are captured by Darth Vader, along with Boba Fett who had tracked them to Cloud City. Lando insists he was forced to conspire with the Empire to prevent them from occupying (or likely destroying) the city.In captivity, Han is tortured to lure Luke to the city. Chewbacca is also tortured in his holding cell by an amplified screeching sound. As Vader prepares to wait for Luke to be lured to him by his friends\' agony, he tells Lando that the rebels must never leave the city. Lando, disgusted by Vader\'s treatment of Han and his friends, protests that the deal they struck never included that as a condition any more than handing Han over to Boba Fett. However, when Vader threatens to leave a garrison in the city if Lando keeps complaining, Lando is forced to realize how helpless he is.Vader orders a carbon-freezing chamber prepared to freeze Luke, which will hold him in suspended animation for transport to the Emperor. The process is tested on Han Solo. As Han is lowered into the machine, Leia declares her love for him. He is frozen in carbonite and alive in hibernation and handed over to Fett, who intends to return his quarry to Jabba the Hutt for a large reward.Meanwhile, Luke lands at Cloud City and is lured into the carbon-freezing chamber. Luke meets Vader and a ferocious lightsaber fight ensues. While escorting their prisoners, Vader\'s Imperial troopers are intercepted by Lando\'s private security force, who set Lando and the others free. Lando, despite nearly being killed by a furious Chewbacca, insists that there is still a chance to save Han, and along the way they find R2-D2. The group pursues Boba Fett and Han\'s frozen form through Cloud City, but arrives just as the bounty hunter\'s ship flies away. After a desperate chase from Imperial troops, Leia, Chewbacca, Lando, and the two droids make their escape on the Millennium Falcon.As the Falcon leaves Cloud City, Luke is trapped on the bottom level of the carbon-freezing room. As he heads down a dark hallway Vader ambushes him, stepping out of a doorway and swinging his light saber down. Vader and Luke\'s fierce light saber duel brings them to a narrow platform above the city\'s central air shaft. The Dark Lord corners Luke on a catwalk, threatening him; \'You are beaten! It is useless to resist!\' Luke resumes the fight; Vader suddenly cuts an instrument panel apart. As Luke unwittingly glances at it, Vader slashes off Luke\'s right hand at the wrist, disabling him and sending Luke\'s light saber tumbling into the huge shaft. With Luke cornered and defenseless, Vader informs Luke that he does not yet know the truth about his father. Luke claims that Vader killed him. Vader answers:""No, I am your father.""Luke screams in denial. Vader tries to persuade Luke to join him, embrace the Dark Side of the Force, and overthrow the Emperor with him. Luke refuses, lets go, and falls off the platform into the abyss, signifying that he would rather die than join him. In free fall, Luke is sucked into an air vent, shoots out of the underbelly of the floating city, and lands on an antenna hanging beneath. Luke tries to pull himself back into the exhaust pipe, but with only one hand and no strength left, he is unable to pull himself up and the hatches close over his head, trapping him on the weather vane. He pleads for help from Ben, but the old Jedi Knight will not appear. Luke then attempts to reach out to Leia, using the Force.On the Millennium Falcon Leia senses Luke\'s distress through the Force and orders Lando to pilot them back to Cloud City -- Lando protests immediately but Chewbacca\'s roar convinces him to do so. As they approach the underside of the city, Lando spots Luke hanging on to the weather vane and opens the Falcon\'s outer hatch. Luke falls off the weather vane and Lando pulls him in just as the three TIE fighters from the \'Executor\' appear, and start a rapid pursuit. As they leave Cloud City, they are pursued by Darth Vader\'s flagship. R2-D2, who discovered that the hyper-drive was merely deactivated while searching the city\'s central computer, reactivates it and the Falcon escapes into hyperspace. Aboard the flagship, Admiral Piett fears Vader will kill him for this failure, but the Sith Lord simply walks away silently.In the final scene, the fugitive and defeated rebel fleet has assembled in a point beyond the galaxy to decide their next move. Aboard a Rebel medical frigate, Luke is fitted with an artificial hand as Lando and Chewbacca set out in the Falcon to locate Han Solo with Luke arranging to join them when he is released from medical care. Luke and Leia watch the ship speed off toward the galaxy.']"
2,Star Wars,Return of the Jedi,86190,"[""I noticed that A NEW HOPE and THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK are in the TOP 10, but that this one isn't even in the TOP 100.This movie has a bad reputation because of Ewoks, but there are so many reasons to love this movie:-The Rescue of Han Solo from Jabba: This official wraps up the Han Solo in debt sub-plot that was established when we first met the character in A NEW HOPE.-The Emperor was Finally Revealled: Well alright this might not work as well now that the prequels are out but this was the first time we saw The Emperor as kids.-The Speeder Bike Chase: Alright, so this was a special effects moment. But it was definitely one of the most memorable and exciting moments in all the films!-The 3 Part Climax: 1) The Battle of Endor (Led by Han and Leia) 2) Luke Confronts his Father & The Fall of the Emperor 3) The Destruction of the Second Death Star (Lando's Moment)-The Final Celebration with Our Heroes: Like I said, this movie gets a lot of crap because of the Ewoks but I think it's kind of cool that while the entire galaxy celebrates the FALL OF THE EMPIRE, our heroes are having their own private party in the woods with each other.All in all this was a great final chapter for our heroes and a fitting end to the STAR WARS story."", ""This movie might not be as flawless as the first two but everything involved with those throne room scenes were some of the highest points in the entire saga, the conflict between luke and vader, the emperor himself finally showing up for the first time and he's so good at being this manipulative evil, the final lightsaber battle is just breathtaking with that amazing music by john williams and the beautiful ending of the film that brings everything together, those moments alone makes this one of the most underrated in the whole franchise and in my opinion it's the second best movie behind the empire strikes back."", ""Totally should've won at least some of the awards it was nominated for! A very different adventure story with lots of adorable characters, more truths and the epic Emperor Palpatine! I love all the majestic forest aspects. Still crazy to me that they filmed so many parts especially the chases. The bulk of this art in cinema is done so well and always entertaining. Quite lovable many years later and not many movies have that kind of force!"", 'A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away.....There was a boy who was only two years old when the original ""Star Wars"" film was released. He doesn\'t remember first seeing the movie, but he also doesn\'t remember life before it. He does remember the first ""Star Wars"" themed gift he got...a shoebox full of action figures from the original set. He was too young to fully appreciate how special that gift would be. But years later, he would get what to this day goes down as one of the best gifts he\'s ever received: another box full of action figures, ten of the final twelve he needed to complete his collection. It\'s now legendary in this boy\'s family how the last action figure he needed, Anakin Skywalker, stopped being produced and carried in stores, and how this boy went for about ten years (until he got into college) trying to track one down and finally bought it from someone on his dorm floor for a bag of beer nuggets (don\'t ask...it\'s a Northern Illinois University thing).I can\'t review ""Star Wars"" as a movie. It represents absolutely everything good, fun and magical about my childhood. There\'s no separating it in my mind from Christmases, birthdays, summers and winters growing up. In the winter, my friends and I would build snow forts and pretend we were on Hoth (I was always Han Solo). My friends\' dad built them a kick-ass tree house, and that served as the Ewok village. They also had a huge pine tree whose bottom branches were high enough to create a sort of cave underneath it, and this made a great spot to pretend we were in Yoda\'s home. I am unabashedly dorky when it comes to ""Star Wars"" and I think people either just understand that or they don\'t. I don\'t get the appeal of ""Lord of the Rings"" or ""Star Trek"" but I understand the rabid flocks of fans that follow them because I am a rabid fan of George Lucas\'s films.I feel no need to defend my opinion of these movies as some of the greatest of all time. Every time I put them in the DVD player, I feel like I\'m eight years old again, when life was simple and the biggest problem I had was figuring out how I was going to track down a figure of Anakin Skywalker.Grade (for the entire trilogy): A+', 'I\'m sick of people whining about Ewoks! True, they\'re not the best thing that ever happened to Star Wars, but they DID happen, so deal with it! Besides, they ARE cute, and I don\'t care if they\'re marketable. Yubb Nubb!This movie always leaves me in tears. It\'s perfect. The end could not be better. I\'m excited for The Phantom Menace because it will suddenly throw the focus of the whole story from Luke to Anakin. I love how he is revealed at the end - it would be too unresolved any other way. So those of you who are complaining that Vader\'s helmet was removed, take a moment to think about it. It\'s very effective. Vader, the man who hid behind a mask for 20 years, is finally revealed as a sick-looking man. He is not entirely machine - he\'s vulnerable.I don\'t know how the casting director happened to pick such good actors in A New Hope. They all do so well. They are believable characters. Hamill does an excellent job with his dramatic character development. Fisher does a fine job being a female role model (I mean, come on! She killed Jabba even when so many others had failed!). Harrison Ford - need I say more?The music is once again brilliant. It\'s so very touching and significant when you can pick out character themes at different parts of the movie. The best climax is when Luke shouts ""NOOO!"" and jumps out to fight his father in the Final Battle. John Williams is nothing short of a genius! What an amazing man!Already, the movie has so much more meaning for me because of Episode I. I can\'t wait to finally see it in the theatres (CAN I WAIT???) and then watch the original trilogy yet again.Bravo!', 'They used to make films that were this good. It is shockingly good despite it being a sequel, which is why it does not feel like a sequel. Watch and re-watch.', 'Star Wars: Episode VI – Return of the Jedi (1983) is a third sequel in the original Star Wars trilogy it is flawed, yet very entertaining solid third sequel and an epic conclusion to the original Star Wars trilogy. Honestly in my opinion Return of the Jedi is far way better film than The Force Awakens, that movie was a disaster and it sucked, I rather watch this movie any time. It is not my favorite film in the series and I don\'t love this movie that much like I love the first two movies, but I like it and it think it is very good at some points. The film has a lot of problems, that hurts the movie. I still have enjoyed this movie and I had a lot of fun. Return of the Jedi (1983) is directed this time from Richard Marquand a different director than it was directed from Irvin Kershner and George Lucas. This movie was released on the same year that I was born in 1983. The film is pretty good on it is own way, but on the other thing it suffers from problems and flaws.Things I like in this movie: The first hour is set back on planet Tatooine which is a rescue mission which I like, the story is set where the first movie begins and ends here.Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker, Chewbacca, Lando Calrissian, Princess Leia Organa, C-3PO, and R2-D2 return to Tatooine to rescue Han Solo (who was encased in carbonite at the end of Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back) from the gangster Jabba the Hutt (voice: Larry Ward).A battle on ship, with Luke steadily taking the fight to Jabba\'s men. During the battle, Leia strangles Jabba to death with the chain around her neck and with R2-D2\'s help escapes from her bonds. The heroes destroy the ship, kills the bad guys and save Han solo. I love the explosion, the rescue and than they are all save.I love that we find out from ghost of Obi-Wan ""Ben"" Kenobi (Alec Guinness) that Leia (Carrie Fisher) is the sister of Luke ( Mark Hamill). I love that Luke revels to Leia that she is his sister.I like the battle on the Endor, Leia, Han, Chewbacca, C-3PO, R2-D2 and Ewoks are battling Stormtroopers to destroying the shield generator for the second Death Star and they do the destroy it. Lando and his assault team destroys the deaths tar on the end.Luke face Darth Vader and the evil Emperor and fights both of them, while they where both trying to bring him on a dark side of the force to join them.I love when Vader toys with the notion of turning Leia to the dark side, Luke gives in to his rage and furiously gains the upper hand in the battle, slicing off Vader\'s right robotic hand in a rage in one swift cut, and makes his father succumb to defeat at the mercy of his son\'s blade.Realizing that Luke cannot be turned, the Emperor uses Force lightning against him to torture and attempt to kill him. Deeply affected by the sight of his son dying before him, Vader repents and turns on the Emperor, throwing him down a reactor shaft to his death.Luke try\'s to save Anakin but he dies before he could save him.I feel that Luke\'s transition from a teenager to calm and collected warrior of the Force feels very authentic. His conflict between Darth Vader and the Emperor contains some of the best scenes in the entire saga.Things I don\'t like: The film has a few problems that are really unnecessary and I really hate it: This movie\'s biggest flaw is the pacing, the Ewoks and their role in the film. Star Wars been in a forest, aren\'t Star Wars suppose to set in the Galaxy and not in the forest? Personally I don\'t mind the Ewoks, but their introduction causes the movie comes to a screeching halt. Another fault of this movie is its attempts at humor. It feels often unnatural and forced a lot of the time. The Phantom Menace has been notorious for having this problem as well, but they most likely originated here.Master Yoda dies in this film! Why? Watching Yoda in the prequels I have really enjoyed him much more than I have watching him in the last two movies. Little guy grove up in to my heart. So I disagree about him dying.I am giving this movie an 8, I watch A New Hope and Retun of the Jedi on TV as a kid I don\'t remember watching The Empire Strikes Back, but I have saw those tow movies and still I like Return of the Jedi a lot.', 'Legendary all-encompassing, complete a great final.star warsa not after starting 6 movies 60 movies you would watch, you never want to end this series in this series. .Because all of them are very friendly, cute and warmly created characters.But unfortunately we have to finish the series with the return of the jedi.As Luke enters into a war of will with his father and emperor, the rebels are struggling both in the woods and in space, especially the dialogues between the emperor Darth Vader and Luke are well written and immersive, and the Ewok are so sweet and especially fun to think of 3CPO as a god.', 'After ""Star Wars: A New Hope"" redefined science fiction, and ""The Empire Strikes Back"" redefined ""Star Wars"", it\'s hard to believe that the third and final film of this trilogy can manage to be as good as the other two, but this one really does a nice job. The first part of the film resolves the cliffhanger left by the previous one, with an elaborate escape plan that is in keeping with the incredible suspense and action of the first two films. Then the film moves back to the rebel alliance and what\'s going on in the war. There is a lot of action in the scenes building up to the rebellion\'s final confrontation with the Emperor. When the battle begins, the audience is already on the edge of their seats from everything leading up to it, and this final battle is even more intense than those from the other films. This climax is definitely more dense with action than any other part of the trilogy, with the most at stake for the rebellion. This is continually changing between a ground battle between the rebel strike crew on land (including Han Solo, Chewbacca, and Leia), the battle raging on in space (including Lando), and a confrontation between Luke and the Emperor on the new Death Star, which leads up to another duel with Darth Vader. It is really intense since the rebels constantly seem to be losing the battle that will determine the outcome of the war, and there seems to be no escape. Although I think the idea of Ewoks overpowering stormtroopers is a bit far-fetched, it didn\'t seem very unrealistic since they were more of a distraction that the rebels could use, rather than an actual threat to the stormtroopers, although they did have some luck fighting them. There is also a twist or two at the end that nobody saw coming, which may not be quite as stunning as that of ""The Empire Strikes Back"", but still complete a very spectacular trilogy very well. With the light tone of ""A New Hope"" and the more sinnister tone of ""The Empire Strikes Back"", this film really completes them by combining the two in this grand finale. The Special Edition for ""Return of the Jedi"" concentrated on what would have been nice to change, since not much of the original really needed it. Fifteen years of technology advancements didn\'t seem to make up for fifteen years of deterioration as far as the rancor scene is concerned, and there still is the occasional disappearing TIE fighter, but other than that it was good. The gaping non-threatening Sarlaac\'s mouth was given moving tentacles and a huge fly-trap looking head that emerged, which definitely added to the suspense. Also, the disco was taken out of Jabba\'s palace, and the lame ending of the original was replaced by a huge victory celebration spanning the entire galaxy, instead of just a small Ewok village, which was the case of the original and that didn\'t really end a story this big the way it deserved. It\'s hard to say which of the three films was the best, but since it\'s all part of the same story, the over-all trilogy is like one big, outstanding film. A THIRD must-see for film fans.', 'Up until the sixth and last episode of the Star Wars saga, which finally ended in 2005, I had always looked at this 1983 entry as my favorite film of the long-running series. The varied action scenes and really different characters (Jabba The Hut, furry woodland creatures, etc.) made this a particularly appealing movie.None of the action ever focused too long in one spot, either. The last half hour exemplifies this the most as the scene switches every few minutes from the woods to the battle among space ships to the individual laser-duel between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader.Another nice characteristic this film had that the two previous did not was the absence of in-fighting between two of the stars. Gone was the incessant bickering between Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford. Finally, everyone was on the same page! It was nice to see.In the end, this was simply a wonderful adventure tale, more than anything else.', 'Perspective is a good thing. Since the release of ""Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace"", claims and counter-claims of just how Episode\'s II and III will eventuate has taken the spotlight off the \'original\' Star Wars films, making them part of a cohesive whole, rather than segregating the older and new films into separate trilogies. What the new films have done is allow fresh perspectives to be placed on the older films. This new outlook allows us to greater appreciate what has often been viewed as the weakest of the original trilogy: ""Return of the Jedi"". Often derided for its overly \'cute\' factor, ROTJ is in a sense as strong as the original and only slightly less impressive than the nearly perfect ""The Empire Strikes Back"". Indeed the \'cute\' element of ROTJ, namely the Ewoks, remains a weak link in the entire series. Did George Lucas place the furry midgets in the film purely for the merchandising possibilities? Only he can answer that question.This cute factor aside, the film is a brilliant full circle AND evolution of the saga. Following on from the conclusion of ""The Empire Strikes Back"", Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) follows his Rebel Alliance friends to Tatooine, his home planet, to rescue Han Solo (Harrison Ford), the space pirate turned Rebel hero who was captured by Jabba the Hutt for overdue debts. Skywalker is a changed man since leaving Tatooine with Ben \'Obi Wan\' Kenobi (Alec Guiness) to fight the evil Empire. Now swathed all in black, Luke\'s discovery of his origins have left him confused and torn. His psychological make up is not as strong as his outward appearance would suggest. While he might aim to always assist his Rebel friends, he yearns for another chance to confront the evil Darth Vader again, despite his unassuredness as to whether he will destroy him or eventually turn to the Dark Side and join Vader at the Emperor\'s side.Early scenes in Tatooine are impressive, from Jabba\'s lair, to his floating palace and the \'almighty Sarlac\' - an intenstine that lives in the sand. Lucas\' CGI enhancements to the film in 1997 actually worsened the overall effect of the Sarlac, making it look fake and overdone. The battle scene on Tatooine is outstanding, and is one of the more memorable of the saga. Luke almost singlehandedly anihiliates Jabba and his cronies, proving his prowess as a Jedi is now almost complete.When Luke returns to the Degobah system to visit the ailing Yoda one more time, the viewer is let down by Yoda\'s distinct lack of screentime. Undoubtably the star of ""The Empire Strikes Back"", Yoda is all but erased from the story as the progression of Luke\'s destiny is played out on screen. ROTJ really is Luke\'s film, perhaps even more so than the original. His journey carries the movie as he moves closer to his confrontation with Darth Vader and his fate. The other Rebel characters certainly work in his shadow. The romance between Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Solo is all but non-existant, unlike in ""Empire"". In fact only Leia\'s character is developed in ROTJ, Solo\'s character seems to fade as the facets of his personality have become too familiar in the first two films.Their roles are consigned to working alongside the Rebels to destroy an all new Death Star that nears completion. This time the Emperor himself is overseeing the final stages of construction. The Empire intends to crush the Rebellion once and for all, while the Emperor himself schemes to bring the now powerful Skywalker to his side to work alongside (or is that replace?) Darth Vader. The Emperor is a different kind of evil for this film, less cunning than Governor Tarkin (Peter Cushing) from ""Star Wars"", more deeply psychologically dark than anything else. Played brilliantly by Ian McDiarmid, the Emperor is just one of those characters you love to hate.All the other actors are well entrenched in their roles. Hamill surprises as the more wisened Luke, making his character\'s progression from whiny teenager, impatient student to enlightened warrior one of the few real character developments of the series. Ford\'s role is waring thin, as all his charm and charisma was spent in the first two films -- he was the REAL star of the first film after all. Fisher\'s Leia is more of a prop, at least unti the end of the film where she learns things about herself that she was never sure about... Add in favourites like Alec Guiness as Kenobi, Yoda and the loveable Chewbacca, C-3PO and R2D2 and the series resembles a family more than a cast.Despite the film\'s corny forest battle involving the Ewoks and the Empire, it ends well and includes a three way battle sequence: on Endor, in space and on the Death Star, each with very impressive special effects. The music, as always, is brilliant and captures the mood perfectly in every instance. Just as the \'Blue Danube\' worked perfectly for ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", John Williams\' score is as much a part of ""Star Wars"" folklore as light sabers and the Force.Lucas left the ending open to interpretation, meaning there could have been more episodes made. Indeed sci-fi fans have created their own versions of Episodes VII, VIII and IX in their heads over and over again. ROTJ works when given a chance, and furry cute animals aside is a good finish to the series.When all six episodes get to be viewed together, this saga could well be the best ever made. Is it already? The addition of Episode I changed the landscape of the series. This is why ""Return of the Jedi"" can now be viewed in a different light and be given a whole new appreciation nearly 20 years after its release.', 'The original Star Wars series was brilliant and should have been left there, especially the ending of this film as It was a perfect ending to a perfect trilogy. Original, ahead of its time and great writing/story.', ""My five children were growing up but all still at home when 'Return of the Jedi' came to the theater. While there had been other Sci-Fi movies with a theme of conflict in outer space, the 'Star Wars' trilogy filled our imaginations like no other movies before them. The fantastic, strange worlds were presented almost like we were there too. Aliens sitting around a tavern, enjoying drinks and speaking in all sorts of languages. Nothing before had approached the sheer size of the space ships depicted here, huge cities traveling all over the galaxy. And how about the jump to hyper speed, then disappearing from the screen as the speed exceeds light speed! And the light sabres of the Jedi Knights. The Jedi Knights, a striking parallel to the Japanese Samurai.After the fantastic 'Star Wars' and 'Empire Strikes Back' (now called parts IV and V on DVD), the last episode 'Return of the Jedi' was bound to be somewhat of a let down, but not much of one. It was made to achieve resolution. Of the rebels' battle with the evil Empire. The relationship between Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker, and the Princess, and her relationship with Han Solo. We witness Luke's Jedi training at the hands of Yoda, as Luke becomes the Last Samurai, I mean Jedi. The DVDs finally came out last month, and they are near perfect, as we should expect from Lucas Films and THX. The bit rate is high, and the picture is nothing short of superb. As is the Dolby EX surround track. My wife and I watched all three of the movies on DVD this week -- Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi (now on DVD called parts IV, V, and VI) -- compliments of our local public library. It was an appropriate reminder how good these movies are, and still ahead of their time. Nothing else has been made to compare to them."", 'I like the bit when the ewoks crush an ATST with two logs on a rope', 'This final entry in George Lucas\'s STAR WARS movies is often regarded as the weakest of the lot. However, this is not to say that it is a totally worthless entry in the series. On the contrary. Sure, it\'s not as groundbreaking as its predecessors and a bit more slow-going at times, but RETURN OF THE JEDI still offers a lot to warrant the price of admission.The first third of the movie, where Luke and his friends rescue Han from the palace of Jabba the Hutt, is a classic. Jabba, a truly disgusting blob of bloated flesh who speaks in his own language, not only makes a great villain, but a memorable one, too. It must have been a nightmare to construct this giant puppet, much less give it the spark and life that we see on the finished product. Actually, what also makes this sequence fun is the clever use of puppets for the various members of Jabba\'s court, including the intimidating, slavering Rancor and scary Sarlaac pit monster. It builds masterfully to its climax and pulls punches all the while.Things get a little bit slower around the second act, where Luke discovers that he and Leia are related by blood and when we travel to the forest planet of Endor, home of the cuddlesome yet stalwart Ewoks. Most of the complaints about RETURN OF THE JEDI that I\'ve read seem to be centered on these furry creatures, in that they somehow disrupt the tone of the saga. I don\'t totally agree with that, although this moment is probably played out a bit longer than it should. However, their leader, Wicket (played by Warrick Davis) is a delightfully memorable creation, and watching how they handle the Imperial Troops\' technology with their simple, natural weapons provides a nice contrast.By the time we get to the third act, though, the pace picks up again, as we intercut between the Ewoks battle against the troops, Lando and the Rebel Forces launching an attack against the Empire\'s all-new half-completed Death Star, and Luke\'s final showdown with Darth Vader and the Emperor. The latter ties with the Jabba Palace sequence as the highlight of the movie. Mark Hamill flexes his acting chops once again as Luke Skywalker in these scenes, and watching him as a fully matured Jedi Knight makes for an unforgettable performance. Also, as iconic as James Earl Jones\' voice as Darth Vader is, he is rivaled only by the shriveled, crone-like Emperor, played with deliciously raspy, frightening evil by Ian McDiarmid. The tension between this trio heightens the excitement of this climactic moment, which is appropriately darkly lit and menacingly underscored.The STAR WARS movies have always set standards for special effects, and the technical work in RETURN OF THE JEDI can easily hold a candle to its predecessors. The space battle fights are as exhilarating as always, and the speeder bike chase through the forest is a knockout. Of course, given that this movie was made after A NEW HOPE and THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, it probably shouldn\'t be so surprising that the special effects have reached an even greater level of excellence. The acting is classic STAR WARS fare; Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher all mature and deepen into their roles, and Anthony Daniels provides more hilarious moments as C-3PO. Frank Oz\'s Yoda only appears in two scenes, but he makes the most of it. And yes, there\'s also John Williams\' music.All told, while RETURN OF THE JEDI falters a little bit in the middle, the first and third acts deliver in style, making this a rather satisfactory finale to one of the greatest sagas ever.In 1997, George Lucas re-released the classic STAR WARS in digitally restored (and revamped) ""Special Editions"", which featured added-in effects and/or shots as well as some enhancements. Of the three, RETURN OF THE JEDI appears to have caused the most commotion with STAR WARS fans. Perhaps it can be due to the jarringly out-of-place (albeit funny if you\'re not so easily offended) ""Jedi Rocks"" musical number in Jabba\'s Palace, which, although technically amazing, does disrupt the flow of the film. However, I DID like the ending montage scenes where we see victory celebrations occurring on the various planets of the galaxy. This DVD version features yet more tweaking--we get to see more montage finale scenes (notably on Naboo, where we hear what sounds like Jar Jar Binks screaming, ""Wesa free!""), and, in what is probably the most controversial change, Hayden Christensen as the specter of Anakin Skywalker in the closing scenes. Probably due to the intense (and unfair) disdain fans have for his somewhat shaky work in EPISODE II: ATTACK OF THE CLONES it seems inevitable that fans would put this edition down for that alone. However, if you\'re watching the STAR WARS saga chronologically (and contemplating about it), chances are you may react a little differently. Nonetheless, it is an issue that fans have raised, so it\'s probably best to be warned beforehand.As nice as it would be to have Lucas release the original versions of these three classic films, he nonetheless stands by what he said about these revamps being the ""definitive"" editions of his classic trilogy, and, when viewing the STAR WARS movies altogether as one complete saga (as Lucas intended), it actually makes sense to keep them technically and aurally consistent. The original films will always be engraved in our memories, but these new incarnations are just as much fun, if one can give them a chance.', 'Despite the feelings of most ""Star Wars"" fans, in my opinion ""Return Of The Jedi"" is the greatest cinematic film ever created. Ever since the first time I saw it, it\'s depth, intensity, special effects, and moving story have overwhelmed me. The film was so well put together that it has been able to stand the test of time over the last 20 years. Filled with powerful action, as the climax of the original trilogy, George Lucas gives us a rousing finish of the ""Star Wars"" saga in ""Jedi"".Film Summary (Contains Spoilers For Those Who Have Not Seen It)After ""The Empire Strikes Back"" left us hanging for 3 long years we finally find the end of the story in ""Return Of The Jedi"". Darth Vader, in emotional turmoil makes a surprise visit to a new uncompleted Death Star to oversee it\'s construction. The Emperor is first seen in this film as he has the ultimate plan to destroy the Rebel Alliance and bring young Luke Skywalker to the Dark Side. Luke, Lando, Leia, Chewie, and the droids all travel to Tatooine to rescue the frozen Han Solo from the crime Lord; Jabba The Hutt. After Han has been rescued, and Jabba defeated, Luke returns to Dagobah to find a dying Yoda where he learns the awful truth; Darth Vader is in fact his father. The rebel heroes regroup with the Rebel Fleet. Now joined by other species and races including the Mon Calamari the Rebels must make a all-or-nothing plan of attack to destroy the Death Star before it is completed. While Lando heads the space attack in the Millennium Falcon, the Rebel heroes must disable the Death Star\'s shield generator on the Forest Moon Of Endor. It is here that the Rebels happen upon the furry, but mighty Ewoks. During the the two part intense battle, a third battle must take place as Luke willingly delivers himself to Vader in an attempt to convince him to leave the Dark Side. In emotionally charged sequences Luke must face his father as the Emperor lures out his dark emotions. As young Skywalker is about to face his death at the hands of Palpatine, Vader turns on his wicked master to save his son\'s life. Filled with a deep timeless story of good vs. evil, ""Return Of The Jedi"" is a spectacular, emotionally charged film that redeems the good in all of us.', ""Return of the Jedi is certainly the most action packed of the series, and is a fine conclusion to the Star Wars Saga. With Han Solo imprisoned by Jabba the Hut and the Empire building a new Death Star, the rebel alliance is facing an uphill struggle against the dark side, and only our favourite heroes can pull it off.The Opening sequence, set on Tatooine, we see Jabba's palace, a pit of slavery and scum, and new home to Han Solo, as Luke and the gang prepare for his rescue, and with Luke's Jedi powers, they have the edge.We also witness a tremendous triple battle at the end. Han, Leia and Chewy battle it out on Endor, desperate to deactivate the shields protecting the Death Star. The Rebel Fleet led by Lando, battle with the Imperial Fleet while they wait for the shields to go down, and Luke has a final showdown with Darth Vader. An Epic end to a Classic Saga, and it's only just off the pace of the first two.10/10"", 'In many ways, Return of the Jedi cut firmly against the brilliant grain set by Empire Strikes Back. The reason Empire was so effective was that it showed us the rebels were still losing, you can\'t just destroy the Death Star and have everything go away. But here, Lucas rounds out the trilogy with another climactic space battle and everything wraps up really nicely with no questions ask. Return of the Jedi is clearly the least impressive of the original trilogy. It is full of holes, tonal inconsistencies and plot implausibilities. I\'d chalk this up to Richard Marquand not being half as competent as Irvin Kershner, and the departure of Gary Kurtz from the project. Kurtz reportedly left because he and Lucas couldn\'t agree on whether story or spectacle should take priority (Lucas was obviously in favour of spectacle), and you can tell because Return of the Jedi\'s story makes absolutely no sense in places.The opening sequences in Jabba\'s palace entertained me to no end as a child, but now it just confuses me. How long has it been since Empire Strikes Back? Didn\'t Lando and Chewie go in to try and rescue Han? Chewie and the droids are turned over to Jabba, but Leia seems ready to get Han out of there and leave them behind. Was it the plan to get captured? Was Luke\'s plan to get captured? Since when can Luke do Jedi mind tricks? Did Luke go back and train with Yoda for a year, and if so, why wasn\'t ""is Vader really my father"" not asked then? The film\'s screenplay is quite messy and doesn\'t flow on from the rest of the saga. In one typical scene, Yoda admonishes Luke for rushing off to face Vader without proper training, then says he doesn\'t need anymore training and only when he confronts Vader will he be a Jedi. Again, maybe some concrete evidence on how long has passed would help. This film is the point where the story meant little to Lucas and the details even less (Solo is promoted from Captain to General where all he did was get frozen in carbonite, and Calrissian walks off the street into the role of General!). I\'ve always regarded Darth Vader quite lowly on my list of movie villains, and watching Star Wars and Empire Strikes Back I found myself wondering why. I now realise its because Return of the Jedi completely nukes him. The idea of there still being good in Vader comes completely out of nowhere - he tortured his son with the knowledge that his father is the most evil man in the galaxy and then chopped his hand off and let him fall to his likely death. The addition of Emperor Palpatine also relegates Darth Vader to a side character - during the conversations between Luke and the Emperor, Vader sort of stands diffently to the side and chips in with the occasional ""yeah. what he said."" Palpatine\'s character development pretty much begins and ends with ""evil"" - he seems so sure that Luke will join him, yet Luke\'s battle with the dark side emerges only as a plot point in those scenes. Even if Luke turns to the dark side, what will make him join Palpatine? The expanded universe implies more information about this, but its not very well established here. The execution is pretty inconsistent - Luke goes from being Alec Guinness-style calm to flailing his lightsaber around like he\'s never held one before. Now that I mention it, Mark Hamill seems to be playing two characters simultaneously. I\'ve covered what I didn\'t like, but this is a Star Wars film and there\'s so much to love. The epic space battle at the second Death Star only reminds me how much I missed it in Empire Strikes Back. Ford is having a lot of fun in this movie, and the rest of the cast delivers pretty solidly as well. The gorgeously shot introduction of Red Guards in stark contrast with the white stormtroopers is a beautiful throwback to Vader\'s black/white contrast in the original Star Wars, and once again, it tells us the bars have been raised. The sound editing/mixing is always in good form in Star Wars - my favourite scene being a harsh lightsaber ignition sound just as Luke says Vader won\'t hurt him or turn him over to Palpatine. The Battle of Endor walks a narrow line between cheesy and genuinely exciting, and Marquand keeps the Ewoks just shy of the Gungans.Return of the Jedi is a really fun movie, but its not a cinematic artwork like its predecessors. I grew up watching this film, but when I read about where the story would have gone were it not for Lucas\' toy revenue - the death of Han Solo and a tired Luke walking into the distance like an old Western - I\'d be lying if I said the film\'s sickly sweet dance party ending didn\'t stick in my craw just a bit.', 'Spoilers: I remember looking so forward to this as a kid after loving the first two movies. They had previews for new characters on the back of the action figures boxes I\'d get at Toys-R-Us and I\'d eagerly wonder what the blacked out Ewok characters would look like. Must have really been something special! I even remember how they switched the name around as ""Revenge of the Jedi."" This was just going to be THE movie of the summer, and waiting in line to get in while hearing the thunderous noise of the climactic battle as the audience of the screening just wrapping up applauded enthusiastically, I was just SO excited. When I saw it even as a kid I knew it was somewhat of a disappointment, watching it now as an adult...Uhgg! Now I see how Lucas went so wrong with the abomination of the prequels, all the threads started to unravel with this Turkey. (Though Return of the Jedi is still much superior to those aforementioned prequels which had a plot harder to follow than Dune.) First of all are notoriously unbearable Ewoks, even as a kid I HATED them. No adult could possibly find anything watchable about the whole Ewok sequence on Endor. The Emperor is ridiculously ""comic book"" evil, tyrants usually have charisma and are more like gangsters than lunatics. The choice to add another family revelation by making Leah Luke\'s sister is stupid and ruins the relationship from the first two movies. The original Cantina scene with the various aliens was creative, here Lucas has gone overboard with a new bizarre rubber masked actor or puppet cropping up every minute. In some respects this whole thing is nothing more than a commercial to sell action figures to eight year olds. And the Climax: Another Deathstar? Lucas, you already did that before, but considering the fecal ideas he spewed out in the prequels, perhaps a rehashing of the end of the first movie was the best we could hope for. After all, to sum up the cinematic ideas going through Lucas\' head during this period: Howard the Duck. Don\'t even get me started on the vandalism Lucas did to the Original Trilogy with the CGI additions to the new copys of the Star Wars movies for sale. The original 1977 print is a piece of American History, to alter the imagery that swept the nation that summer is akin to someone painting over the Mona Lisa.Still Return of the Jedi it did have it\'s moments. The Jabba the Hut character is ubiquitously reknown and to this day everyone knows what your talking about if you refer to any gluttonous tard as ""Jabba the Hut."" The chase scene through the Redwoods is also quite memorable although the excitement came to a quick end with the ridiculously infantile Ewok scenes beginning moments later. The final showdown between Luke and Vader was also a glimpse of what this movie could have been had the same people who worked on The Empire Strikes Back had control over this thing. On the whole, a disappointing, childish end to the first two movies.', '...Maybe my personal take? The original Star Wars (1977) was genre changing. The second Star Wars (1980) was an unexpected sequel, a blockbuster in every sense of the word. This third one....well, it made it easy to say goodbye for 16 years and to have lowered expectations when the prequels started arriving in 1999.It just takes itself too seriously. ""I know he\'s OK....I can feeeel it!"". Oh, brother. Talking about The Farce being with you. And no I did not just misspell that word. Obi Wan returns in spirit form to rewrite some history so Luke did not just get thrown over for Han Solo because girls just love the bad boys, but there is some reason and purpose behind it. ""So you told me a bunch of lies?"" Luke asks his one time mentor. ""Well that depends upon what your definition of the word ""IS"" is""...being the gist of how Obi Wan answers him.And we have a fairly meaningless chase through a rain forest, and the most commercial purposeless creature ever created in cinematic history up to that date - the Ewok. Be sure to ask for a miniature for your kids when you order a Big Mac and fries.I\'ve been hard on Episode VI in light of how great IV and V were. I\'m giving it a seven because compared to other films, that is what it is. Compared to its two predecessors it is probably a six. Compared to what Disney has done to the franchise, though, it is probably an eleven!', ""After watching A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back, it's time to watch the final chapter of the Star Wars film franchise, The Return of the Jedi.It stars Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Billy Dee Williams, David Prowse, Frank Oz, Anthony Daniels, etc.The Empire is more than halfway through construction of a new Death Star - almost twice as big, but more than twice as powerful. When completed, it will spell certain doom for Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and the Rebels. Han Solo (Harrison Ford) is a prisoner of crime lord Jabba the Hutt, and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) soon finds herself in the gangster's hands. Luke Skywalker, aided by C-3PO and R2-D2, makes his way into Jabba's palace, hoping to secure his friends' freedom. But the Hutt has no intention of doing so and tries to kill them all. After escaping from Jabba and the sands of Tatooine, they regroup with the Rebel fleet, which is massing for an attack against the new satellite battle station at Endor. Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) is pressed into action to lead the Rebel fighter attack, while Han is put in charge of a group of soldiers to take out the shield generator protecting the Death Star. Luke, however, surrenders to Vader's soldiers on Endor, and is taken in front of Vader's boss - the Galactic Emperor - on the Death Star for final corruption to the Dark Side of the Force. The fleet of Imperial Star Destroyers ambushes the Rebels, cutting them off. Worse, the new Death Star begins turning its giant laser on the Rebel carriers. It appears that nothing will stop the Empire's triumph - unless things start to change quickly.I thought it was a great end to the Star Wars series.But in 1999, the story took itself back into the beginning with Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace and ended with Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith.So far, I'm finished with the Star Wars original trilogies, and there will be more reviews in the summer.Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi gets 10 stars."", ""Long ago, in a Galaxy far away came a film which saved FOX studios from bankruptcy. It was conceived by a 16 year old George Lucas after he saw the 1959 film Ben Hur. This gave him the ideas which are now lynch pins of the entire series - an all powerful force, an evil empire, emperor, a purpose for our universe.This is the best of the series & not just because of the victory over the Empire. It springs a surprise in Luke having a sister, & completes Luke confronting what is left of his father. It destroys an empire & an emperor. It introduces Ewoks & then has them join in an alliance to create the victory. It even makes C3PO a God, & you can't top that.While it does not have a miracle create the complete victory, like Ben Hur does with Christs Crucifixation & events erasing Ben Hur's mother & sisters Leprocey, it does create a man made miracle alliance which ultimately destroys the evil Empire. This really counts big in the scheme of things.There is an ultimate satisfaction in the victory, especially when everyone including Ben, & Darth seem to be a part of it. That is what makes this the ultimate celebration."", 'This is such a great ending to not only the first 3 but all 6. The empire is defeated, Luke becomes a Jedi, Han and Leah get together, the emperor\'s plan back fires and Anakin proves that he is the chosen one.The force does prevail but not how the Jedi thought. Anakin\'s ""mistake"" is what makes him see the error of his ways when Luke is dying. Why? Because we see the world through our kids eyes. And Anakin is still there feeling empathy. If he didn\'t have kids he wouldn\'t have turned to the dark side. And if he didn\'t have kids he wouldn\'t have come back from the dark side. If he was able to express his love he wouldn\'t have had to hide his human nature and could have openly talked with friends and not turned to the dark side.Because Luke proves that love wins in the end. I wonder if Anakin\'s purpose wasn\'t just to kill the emperor but also to bring balance to the force by screwing up so the Jedi could go extinct so they could start fresh? Because they were going wrong as an order. I guess they always were by surpressing people\'s natural urges, as history has shown doesn\'t go so well.The three most innovative Jedi are the ones that break the rules: Qui-Gon, Anakin and Luke. Not to say that the Jedi are bad but they aren\'t doing things as well as they could, they are flawed. Their method created an opening for Anakin to fail, when in the end he was doing the right thing by falling in love.Luke doesn\'t listen to Yoda and Obi and goes to save his friends, which was the right thing to do. His love for his friends is the right choice. He delays his training but saving his friends does so much for the future. And he never wants to kill Vader, he couldn\'t and because his refusal to be an assassin and to trust that his father was still good he won. Because even if he killed Vader he wouldn\'t have killed the emperor and everything that he fought and suffered for would have been for nothing. Yoda and Obi are using Luke to kill Vader and don\'t want to tell him the truth. But the truth makes him do the right thing.It must be said that Mark Hamill did a great job in these movies. It kinda seems like he\'s not acting in 4 because he\'s so natural, but when you get to 6 you see how different he has become and that he was infact acting the whole time. He really transitions Luke very well and matures him nicely.I really love the Ewoks. They are the fiercest things in the Galaxy, only problem is that they\'re three feet tall. But that doesn\'t stop them. I really like how willing they are to help the rebels. A joke I read long ago that has always stuck with me is that they ate the Stormtroopers. Think about it there\'s helmets everywhere and they were going to eat Han and the others.The first half an hour is awesome because it\'s a little self contained story that is only about saving Han. Which of course you want to see. It\'s really a short on its own and a celebration of Star Wars really because no plot comes from it. We get to see our guys have an adventure of saving their friend. There\'s great monsters and action scenes.Jabba is great, so gross and evil. And such a work of art as well. So much work to get him alive, but it paid off because he\'s so real.The Emperor delivers in every way. You thought Vader was evil, no way, this guy is pure evil. And since 3 he has been living as his true self and his evilness is out in the open. I also love now that 3 told us that he has a lightsaber up his sleeve so during these scenes you know it\'s there.Just like with Revenge of the Sith there weren\'t really any innovations here, just perfection of what had been started with the first movie.The best change from the Special Edition for all 3 was the end song to this movie. The Ewok song was fine for an Ewok song but this new song really has such a reflective, end of the road, sad and happy feel to it. It feels like an ending, bitter sweet. It always pops into my head when something in my life is ending. It really says it all and nothing needs to be said because the music conveys the mood perfectly.A perfect end to the saga. You get everything that you want but it\'s not cheap.', ""So what made this movie a step down than its two predecessors? Well, forgive me for nit picking, but I didn't think the humour is as strong as it was in New Hope and Empire Strikes Back. Plus, while it was evident, the romantic elements weren't as developed either. However, putting these flaws aside, it is still enormously entertaining, thanks to the elaborate set pieces and the well choreographed battles(the final battle especially was a knockout). And I will say that it is a vast improvement over the prequels. The plot is still fast paced and sophisticated, and the screenplay while not as fun still is as imaginative as ever.I have heard many complaints about the Ewoks. I think it depends on your perspective whether you like them or not; maybe a delight to younger audiences, maybe too sickly cute to an adult. Being a 17 year old female, I thought they were very cute. The acting is still very impressive, with Mark Hamill spontaneously likable in the lead. Frank Oz is a perfect Yoda and his death scene is heart rending, and Ian McDairmund also steals his scenes as the Emperor. Harrison Ford, in an inspired bit of casting is great again as Han Solo, Carrie Fisher is still vivacious and Alec Guiness the great actor that he was is brilliant as Obi Wan. But my favourite is James Earl Jones as the voice of Darth Vader, his majestic booming voice is very ideal for a dark menacing villain. And I must mention John Williams's music, brilliant and innovative, unquestionably one of the best film scores of all time. All in all, while my least favourite of the original trilogy, Return of the Jedi makes for essential viewing. 9/10 Bethany Cox."", ""This is the film that pretty much answers all the questions. One thing that I did notice is that it dealt with the theme of redemption. Luke pretty much wanted to redeem his father's good name and at the end Vader regains his humanity just in time not only to save his son Luke, but to destroy the Emperor, the man who cost Vader his soul. I also liked the scene in the film where 3PO summarizes the events of the previous chapters for the Ewoks. This also helps to tie everything together as far as the saga is concerned. Also, even though many have called this the weakest film in the trilogy, it still has enough of a story and great special effects to put it on a par with the previous films."", 'The opening crawl reveals that Han Solo\'s friends are engaged in a mission to rescue the smuggler from Jabba the Hutt and that the Galactic Empire is building a new armored space station which is even larger and more powerful than the first Death Star.Near the forest moon of Endor the new Death Star is being constructed in orbit, and a command star destroyer arrives and launches a shuttle with a fighter escort -- a shuttle bearing the Dark Lord of the Sith. Fearing his arrival, the commander of the new Death Star informs Darth Vader (David Prowse, voice: James Earl Jones) that the station will be operational on schedule, but when Vader challenges this ""optimistic"" appraisal of the situation, the commander admits that he needs more men to accelerate construction. Darth Vader, however, informs the commander that the Emperor (Ian McDiarmid) will be arriving soon, and that he is most displeased with the commander\'s progress. Shaken, the commander commits to redoubling construction efforts. Vader, pleased, remarks, ""the Emperor is not as forgiving as I am.""Jedi Knight Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), Princess Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher), C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), and R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) return to Tatooine to rescue Han Solo (who was encased in carbonite at the end of The Empire Strikes Back (1980)) from the gangster Jabba the Hutt (voice: Larry Ward). Luke sends C-3PO and R2-D2 to Jabba\'s desert palace to deliver a message: In a hologram projected by R2, Luke offers to bargain with Jabba for Solo himself -- if Jabba does not, he will be destroyed. Jabba laughs at the message and refuses to give up his ""favorite decoration:"" Han, frozen in carbonite, hangs on a wall in Jabba\'s court. The two droids are sent to EV-9D9\'s workshop where C-3P0 is given the job of Jabba\'s translator and R2 will be a drink-server on Jabba\'s sail barge.Disguised as a bounty hunter named Boushh, Leia arrives in Jabba\'s court with Chewbacca in cuffs. She offers him to Jabba for a sizable bounty. After Leia dickers with Jabba over the amount and threatens him with a small thermal detonator, Jabba happily agrees to pay, impressed with the bounty hunter\'s nerve, and Chewbacca is imprisoned.That night, Leia sneaks into Jabba\'s court and frees Han from the carbonite. However, she and Solo are both captured by Jabba. Solo is imprisoned with Chewbacca and Jabba keeps Leia on display in a metal bikini and chains. Luke arrives with a final ultimatum to release Solo. Jabba again refuses and drops Luke through a trap door into a pit below his throne that houses the rancor, a fearsome beast that Jabba keeps for executions. As Leia watches in horror, she sees Lando Calrissian disguised as a palace guard. After a brief battle, Luke defeats the rancor, enraging Jabba, who declares that Luke, Solo and Chewbacca will be slowly consumed by the sarlacc -- a huge, shark-toothed, tentacled maw at the bottom of the Great Pit of Carkoon.The group is taken to the pit on Jabba\'s sail barge fleet, and Jabba sadistically attempts to draw out the spectacle by inviting them to grovel for their lives. Han and Chewbacca refuse, but Luke calmly notes to the gangster that he is about to pay dearly for his arrogance to Jabba\'s scoffing amusement. The group is prepared for execution: Luke is the first, pushed out onto a thin plank over the pit. Luke gives R2 a short salute and drops off the plank, only to spin and grab the plank to launch himself back on board. At that moment, R2 catapults a small object, Luke\'s new lightsaber, to the Jedi\'s hand. A battle erupts, with Luke steadily taking the fight to Jabba\'s men. During the battle, Leia strangles Jabba with the chain around her neck and with R2-D2\'s help escapes from her bonds. Solo accidentally knocks Boba Fett (Jeremy Bulloch) into the sarlacc pit. Lando is also thrown off one of the skiffs, hanging by a few cables until he\'s rescued from the sarlacc itself by Han and Chewbacca. Luke, having fought his way onto Jabba\'s sail barge, has the escaping Leia aim the deck cannon at the vehicle and sets it on automatic fire; the sail barge soon blows apart. Our heroes manage to escape before it explodes, retrieve R2 and C-3PO and zip off into the desert. Luke flies off Tatooine in his X-Wing fighter and the rest of the band fly away in the Millennium Falcon to rendezvous with the Rebel fleet near Sullust.A massive fleet of fighters completely surrounds the boarding bays of the Death Star at the arrival of the Emperor. As Red Guards slowly descend from the Imperial shuttle and flank its ramp, Vader and the Death Star commander kneel to their master, the last to enter the hangar. He insists that Lord Vader will soon capture Luke Skywalker, and Luke will learn of the dark side of the Force when brought before Palpatine himself.Luke returns to Dagobah to complete his Jedi training, but he finds Yoda (voice: Frank Oz) is ill. He tells Luke that no further training is required and all that remains to be done is to confront Darth Vader. Luke attempts to get independent confirmation of Darth Vader\'s claim to be Luke\'s father, but Yoda is evasive. Finally, Luke begs Yoda to tell him the truth, and Yoda, emotional torture clearly evident on his normally serene features, confirms Luke\'s darkest fears. He correctly infers that Vader has used this information as an emotional weapon against Luke, and criticizes Luke for having faced Vader prematurely, with nearly disastrous consequences. He reminds Luke of the true nature of the Force, and of the soul-corrupting nature of the dark side. Yoda then issues a dark warning, telling Luke how his father fell to the shadow: he was corrupted by the powers and influence of the Emperor. If Luke allows himself to be manipulated by this dark mind, then he too shall become what he most fears.Finally, Yoda charges Luke with keeping alive the teachings and knowledge of the Jedi and the Force, urging him to start with his own family, with whom the Force is unusually strong. With his final breath, Yoda tells Luke that there is ""another Skywalker."" Yoda dies at peace, and before Luke\'s astonished eyes, his body vanishes, passing with his spirit into the Force. The spirit of Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) confronts a distraught Luke, confirming that Vader was once Anakin Skywalker, a Jedi who was turned to the dark side of the Force. Obi-Wan confesses to Luke that he made mistakes in Anakin\'s training, especially by not deferring to Yoda, and takes responsibility for indirectly creating the evil Darth Vader. Luke counters that even now, all is not lost, that some part of Anakin remains, if only someone can reach it. When Luke asks about the other Skywalker, Obi-Wan tells him that Luke has a twin sister, hidden from Anakin and separated from Luke at birth to protect them both from the Emperor. Luke intuits that his sister is Princess Leia. Obi-Wan confirms it, but warns Luke that in the eyes of the Empire, all bonds of love and caring are potential weaknesses to be exploited.Meanwhile, the entire Rebel Alliance fleet is massing their near Sullust, meeting to devise an attack strategy on the uncompleted Death Star. As part of the attack, Han and his companions must land on the forest moon of Endor and deactivate the generator that projects a protective shield up to the orbiting Death Star. The team, led by Han, will use a stolen Imperial shuttle and confirmation code to infiltrate the heavy security measures protecting the construction site before the rest of the Rebel fleet arrives. Luke arrives at the meeting and tells Han and Leia that he\'ll join them on the dangerous commando mission. The fleet\'s assault on the Death Star will be lead by Lando Calrissian, piloting the Millennium Falcon, which will fly into the core of the space station and destroy the main power generator.The team arrives at Endor in the stolen shuttle and uses the confirmation code to sneak past the Imperial fleet. Luke senses that Vader is aboard the Imperial fleet\'s largest ship, the super-star destroyer Executor, and believes he\'s endangering the mission. Han tells him not to worry.When they arrive on the moon, the team happens across a small unit of Imperial biker scouts. Han tries to sneak up on the scouts to disarm them but draws their attention when he steps on a branch. Leia and Luke jump on speeder bikes and pursue two more scouts through the forest at high speed. They overtake them both but are separated; Leia\'s bike crashes into a tree after she jumps off and she falls unconscious. Luke jumps off his own bike and battles with the the scout he\'d been pursuing, forcing him to crash using his lightsaber. When Luke rejoins the team, he finds that Leia hasn\'t returned. The team looks for her but is captured by indigenous creatures called Ewoks -- short, furry, intelligent forest dwellers. An Ewok called Wicket (Warwick Davis) befriends Leia, but the other Ewoks who captured the rest of the Rebel party decide to sacrifice them to C-3P0, who they believe is a god. Luke, having mastered the Force, levitates C-3P0 to impress the Ewoks with the droid\'s power and scare them into giving up the sacrifice. With the help of C-3PO, Luke and his party form an alliance with the Ewoks, whose stone-age technology has unexpectedly effective military applications.Later, Luke decides that the time has come for him to face Vader. He confesses to Leia that he is her brother, and that he has to try to save the man who was once their father. She tells him to ignore his feelings and leave but Luke tells her that he must face his destiny and if necessary in the event that he falls, she must learn the ways of the Jedi to help oppose the Emperor. Luke surrenders peacefully to Vader but fails to convince his father to abandon the dark side even though Vader is left subtly shaken by his matured son\'s own mind games.They go to the Death Star to meet the Emperor, who reveals that the Rebel Alliance is walking into a trap. On the forest moon, the Rebels led by Solo and Leia enter the shield generator control facility only to be taken prisoner by a large legion of Imperial troops. Once they are led out of the bunker, however, the Ewoks spring a surprise counterattack. In a desperate ground battle, the Rebels and Ewoks fight the Imperial forces. Aboard the Death Star, the Emperor attempts to seduce Luke with the powers of the dark side. The Emperor reveals his plan: the information that Rebel spies had stolen was part of an elaborate plan to draw out the Rebel fleet and command so they could be eliminated in one battle. As Luke\'s anger builds he attacks the Emperor with his lightsaber, only to be stopped by Vader\'s crimson blade.During the strike team\'s assault, the Rebel fleet emerges from hyperspace for the battle over Endor, only to discover that the shield of the Death Star is still functioning. An intense space battle takes place as the Imperial fleet, in the second phase of the Emperor\'s plan, appears and attacks the Rebel fleet. During the battle, the Death Star is revealed to be operational; its superlaser, revealed to be relatively rapid-fire on a low setting compared to its predecessor, is fired at the Rebel fleet and obliterates a Rebel star cruiser. Though Admiral Ackbar wants to abandon the attack, Lando convinces him that they must give Han and his party more time on Endor. The fleet regroups and begins to engage the Imperial fleet of star destroyers directly.On the Death Star, the Emperor taunts Luke to give in to his anger. A ferocious lightsaber duel has erupted between Luke and his father. In the midst of combat, Vader reads Luke\'s feelings and learns that Luke has a twin sister. When Vader toys with the notion of turning Leia to the dark side, Luke gives in to his rage and furiously gains the upper hand in the battle, slicing off Vader\'s right robotic hand in a rage in one swift cut, and makes his father succumb to defeat at the mercy of his son\'s blade. Despite the Emperor\'s goading Luke refuses to kill his father, realizing that he is traveling down his father\'s path towards the dark side, and declares himself a Jedi. Realizing that Luke cannot be turned, the Emperor uses Force lightning against him to torture and attempt to kill him. Deeply affected by the sight of his son dying before him, Vader repents and turns on the Emperor, throwing him down a reactor shaft to his death. At the same time, however, the Emperor\'s Force lightning causes fatal injuries to Vader (Anakin) and short-circuits his breathing system. Stopping momentarily in a landing bay, Anakin asks Luke to take his mask off, knowing that he\'ll die, but desiring to look at his son\'s face with his human eyes. Luke removes the helmet, revealing the pale and scarred face of his father (Sebastian Shaw). Anakin says that Luke was right about him, and asks Luke to tell his sister. With those final words, Anakin dies.Back on Endor, the strike team finally destroys the shield generator. The Rebel fleet seizes the opportunity to launch a final assault on the Death Star in space. Meanwhile to by the attackers more time, Admiral Ackbar orders a concentrated attack on the Imperial fleet\'s flagship, the Executor. With a crashing rebel pilot ramming into the ship\'s bridge, not only is Admiral Piett killed, but the ship goes out of control and collides with the Death Star. Lando leads Wedge Antilles (Denis Lawson) and his fighter group into the bowels of the Death Star, where they fire at the main reactor, causing its collapse. Luke, with the body and armor of Anakin, escapes the Death Star in an Imperial shuttle. Moments later, Wedge in his X-Wing and Lando in the Millennium Falcon emerge from the Death Star just as the space station explodes.On Endor, Han tries to reassure Leia that Luke was likely not on the destroyed station, but Leia already senses that is true. Guessing Leia\'s feelings for Luke, Han offers to step aside for him to court her. However, Leia reassures Han Solo of her love and reveals to him that Luke is actually her brother, who obviously will support their own romance to Han\'s astonished relief. That evening, Luke cremates the remains of his father in a funeral pyre on Endor. The entire galaxy celebrates the fall of the Emperor and the Rebel victory over the Empire. Luke, Leia, Han, Lando, and the rest of the rebels, along with the Ewoks, celebrate the victory as well. During the celebration, Luke catches sight of the spirit figures of Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda, and the redeemed Anakin Skywalker, who look proudly upon him.']"
3,Star Wars,The Phantom Menace,120915,"['Lucas may have problems as a director and writer, but I\'ve always thought that those flaws are balanced by his great storytelling ability. The problem with ""The Phantom Menace"" is that he simply has no story to tell. The film merely adds an introductory chapter to a story that has already been told, and stretches it out into a two-hour movie. It is no accident that prequels of this kind are rare. They are very difficult to make properly. And apparently he\'s just not a sophisticated enough filmmaker to pull it off.For one thing, this project is limited by the fact that anyone familiar with the first trilogy knows the story\'s outcome, and it therefore lacks some of the suspense associated with a gradually unfolding saga. More importantly, however, this situation leaves Lucas with very little freedom as a storyteller. It also encourages him to gloss over key events; because their outcome is a foregone conclusion, he forgets to bring them to life.For example, we know there will eventually be a romance between Anakin and Padme. So Lucas has the two characters meet here and--surprise, surprise--they seem to like each other. Their developing friendship isn\'t portrayed that clearly, and their motivations for becoming close aren\'t explained. Because Lucas fails to make scenes like these believable, we can\'t help being conscious of how he\'s manipulating the plot in his effort to connect the two trilogies. Another good example of this problem is Anakin\'s portrayal as a potential Jedi. There doesn\'t appear to be anything about this kid remotely out of the ordinary, even though the other characters keep talking like there is. Our only reason for thinking he\'s special is that the plot requires it.If the story fails to be engaging, it is because we never see the important events. Lucas makes a fatal error in not showing what\'s happening on Naboo, the small planet whose capture is the focus of the plot. Numerous atrocities are supposedly being committed against the planet\'s inhabitants, but we only know about this because the characters on screen refer to the events, usually rather woodenly.The deadpan performances are a problem in themselves, but they only highlight our lack of involvement in the story. Think of Han Solo sweating in fear, then think of the emotional vacuums passing for characters in this film. Whenever any of the characters do express emotion, as in the scene where Anakin and his mom part, it still seems awfully restrained. Somehow, Lucas manages to keep the emotional reactions of his characters to a minimum, which gives the film an almost mechanical feel.It\'s true that ""A New Hope"" never showed Alderaan\'s inhabitants, but we still could feel the tragedy of the planet\'s destruction through the horrified reactions of Princess Leia and Obi Wan. Moreover, there were many other involving events which we witnessed directly, such as the slaying of rebels at the beginning; the capture and torture of the princess; and the murder of Luke\'s foster parents. Furthermore, the major plot elements were intriguing in and of themselves. They weren\'t there merely to show us how they were to be linked to later events, which seems to be the case with the new film.I suspect that Lucas was not as concerned in the first trilogy with what had to happen later in the story and was therefore able to focus his attention on the events at hand. The weakest segment was ""Return of the Jedi,"" which had the task of bringing the story to an end. Only then did Lucas start to show signs of forcing plot points. In ""The Phantom Menace,"" he gets so bogged down in the task of bringing his story from point A to point B that he ends up with only the bare bones of a plot, and none of it comes alive.This is especially true of the characterization. In the old trilogy, characters like Yoda and Han reveal distinct personalities in their first few minutes on screen. This film goes for more than two hours and the characters, including the familiar ones, come off vague and nondescript. We aren\'t given much of a chance to experience their personalities in the way they interact. We must take Qui Gon\'s word for it when he describes Obi Wan as ""headstrong."" What\'s most odd is that the cartoons seem better developed than the humans. The scenes where Qui Gon negotiates with the birdlike slave-owner Watto are amusing and well-done--probably the movie\'s best scenes aside from the stunning action sequences--but they can\'t hold a candle to the constant interactions throughout the first trilogy.One thing I cannot do is accuse the film of lacking creativity. The design of the creatures, the technologies, and the planets is impressive. Watching the film is sort of like reading a children\'s book that isn\'t very good but abounds with beautiful illustrations. There is certainly a ""wow"" factor in the movie\'s visuals, but the effect of it is short-lived.I get irked when I hear fans talk as though the ""Star Wars"" movies were never about anything beyond special effects. While the inventive visuals are part of what made the originals so revolutionary, they\'re not what made the films so fun to watch. And in no way can they explain the trilogy\'s continuing popularity today. After all, many of the original effects look primitive by today\'s standards, and their novelty has certainly worn off. Only an enduring and compelling storyline could have allowed the first three films to become the classics they\'re almost universally acknowledged to be.', ""While it received generally positive reviews upon its release, and captured the imaginations of an entire generation of younglings, The Phantom Menace has garnered an almost toxic reputation on the internet in the years since. Sure, it's not a perfectly structured film, and yes, there are more than a few dopey decisions, but the sheer spectacle and sense of fun in Star Wars: Episode I cannot be denied. George Lucas' return to a galaxy far, far away is a triumph of creative vision. A movie that overcomes any and all of its narrative deficiencies through the pure drive of its creator to wow, thrill, and inspire.The Phantom Menace is chapter one of the Star Wars Saga, and it feels very much like the beginning of a larger story. It introduces all of the important players in the saga, including Obi-Wan Kenobi, The Jedi Council, and Anakin Skywalker, the tragic hero who we know will one day become the legendary Darth Vader. On a micro level, the plot revolves around an intergalactic trade war that leads to tensions between the Trade Federation and the inhabitants of the peaceful, Garden of Eden-like planet called Naboo. Jedis Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), and Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson), are sent as peacekeepers to protect the planet's leader, Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman) from the evil Trade Federation and the ancient Sith Lord, Darth Maul, one of the most frightening and iconic characters ever to come out of the Star Wars universe. The Trade Federation plot does not have the same level of buoyant escapism as the originals', but it's not far off. The politics are kept at a minimum, and they only serve to create bad guys for our heroes to fight. The more important element of Episode I's story is the extended introduction of young Anakin Skywalker to this new Star Wars universe. The most interesting beats of the story center around Anakin and his mother, and The Jedi council's trepidation regarding the boy Qui-Gon suspects is the Chosen One. You get the sense that there is something special, yet sinister about the young podracing phenom from Tatooine. It's a great aspect of the film that largely goes unrecognized.None of the pieces of the plot really mean much for the prequel trilogy's overarching story of the downfall of Anakin Skywalker, but The actual conflict of Episode I is largely unimportant. At it's core, The Phantom Menace serves as a feature length introduction to George Lucas' new (old) Star Wars Universe. Episode I is the prologue to the Saga, telling a simple story that puts the pieces in place for later films while still standing on its own. On that level, it's kind of brilliant. Lucas takes a universe that was, as sweeping as it felt, still confined to a small collection of characters, and tears the lid off. The Phantom Menace does more to create a fictional history and detailed lore for the Star Wars universe than any other film. All of a sudden, this universe was no longer just a backdrop for the characters to play around in. It became a real place, with real politics, history, tradition, and age-old myths of its own. Remarkable if you ask me.Next to their storytelling, Star Wars movies have always been known for their special effects. With 16 years between movies, George Lucas' ILM team had the chance to perfect all of their award-winning visual effects, and perfect they did. Incorporating a litany of techniques from miniatures and animatronics to innovative use of CGI, The Phantom Menace is a breathtaking film to look at. Every single shot of The Phantom Menace is a work of art, and the sheer amount of imagination put into the world is worthy of praise. From the environments to the vehicles, the costumes, and the creatures, everything in this universe is unique, and ILM and company craft them with an unrivaled eye for detail. So strong is Lucas' vision of this world, that the plotting and dialogue are almost unnecessary. The visual storytelling of The Phantom Menace is that uncommonly strong.That expert craftsmanship extends to the action sequences. George Lucas' strengths as an editor and technician translate to more than a few show-stopping set-pieces. My favorite of which is young Anakin's bid for freedom, a kinetic and thrilling race across the vast deserts of Tatooine. The Podrace is a visually stunning and genuinely tense showcase of absolute speed. It still remains one of the most fun sequences in recent movie history. The same goes for the climactic three-way lightsaber duel at the end of the film. With brilliant visual effects, fast-paced and furious choreography, and a euphoric sense of scope, it brought something brand new to the Star Wars Universe, large-scale lightsaber duels. The battles, both in space and on land, stand out as old-fashioned, innocent fun. Despite a few silly moments, they tap into that Saturday matinee spectacle that resonates with the kid in us all.I love The Phantom Menace, despite its quirks. The script is clunky, especially in the first act where the plot seems to spin its wheels. There are slow moments and plenty of silly gags that fall flat. But my God, this movie is fun to watch! The visual splendor, the larger-than-life action set-pieces, the grand fun of the whole thing, The Phantom Menace is irresistible entertainment. An event movie with this kind of innocent charm is something unique in Hollywood, and that child-like earnestness is what makes this movie particularly endearing for me. The Phantom Menace might be different from the original trilogy in certain aesthetics, but importantly, not in feel. For the majority of this movie's runtime, it exudes the same brand of vibrant movie magic that made A New Hope a beloved classic. I won't call TPM a classic. I have my hangups with it, but I personally cannot bring myself to dislike this movie. Star Wars: Episode I works as an introduction to a brand new world, and as a stand-alone adventure that celebrates the innocent fun of the Original Star Wars.86/100"", ""Star Wars: Episode 1- The Phantom Menace is definitely worth a watch, but I do think it is one of the weaker movies of the Star Wars saga. I will admit I wasn't expecting much after reading some very negative reviews on IMDb, but I do think this particular instalment did in some ways exceed my expectations and disappointed as well. On a visual and technical level, it looks absolutely fantastic, with splendid special effects, stunning cinematography and fine scenery and costumes. The script is fairly decent, perhaps lacking the sophistication of Empire Strikes Back or New Hope, but does have some memorable lines. The action is constantly exhilarating, and Darth Maul, well played by Ray Park is a very good villain. Of course though, Darth Vader is better. Most of the performances are very good, especially Natalie Portman as Queen Padma who looked stunning and Jake Lloyd as Anakin Skywalker who shone with his confident charm. And Jar Jar Binks is okay on the most part, and you have to love Yoda. And the music score by John Williams was outstanding, definitely one of his best works. The quality of sound and direction are also impressive. However, there were things about this film that did disappoint. One is despite the awesome visuals, strong music score and good characters, the story never quite distinguished itself. It did take a while to get going, and when it did try to get going and you could tell it wanted to, it was further disadvantaged by the uneven pacing. Liam Neeson is a fine actor, his performances in Kinsey and Schindler's List are proof of that, and I do like Ewan McGregor. But as Qui-Gon Jin and Obi Wan Kenobi, both stars give unusually wooden performances, and at times looked even embarrassed. And as I said, the pacing is very uneven, there are some slow moments, and one or two scenes felt rushed. All in all, maybe disappointing for fans of the saga, but it cannot be denied that visually it is an accomplishment. 7/10 Bethany Cox"", ""I recently rewatched everything Star Wars including this, the Clone Wars cartoons etc. In preparation for seeing The Force Awakens.Well for someone who wasn't a huge fan of this initially I made a few discoveries and in light of the Force Awakens this movie is a cinematic masterpiece.The story is really quite original (except for that main reactor bit). I really quite liked it and the politics is easier to follow after a few viewings. I remember being quite shocked when I found out the 'queen' wasn't always who we thought.The sets and costumes are really beautiful.JarJar isn't really that bad, let's face it he's there to keep kids happy and that's OK isn't it? Obi-Wan is great, I really liked seeing him younger.I did feel quite sorry for Anakin this time around and I think the actor did quite well with the material he had.Yes this movie has it's issues, it can be slow at times and the bit about Midichlorians still makes me cringe but at least it's original and had a story to tell. It does remind me that Star Wars was really Anakin's story told in 6 parts. The newest 7th 'instalment' is reductive and undoes a lot of the history.Star Wars finished with return of the Jedi and most certainly after George Lucas left. the new Disney stuff has no heart.Please come back George."", ""Jar Jar Binks was such an unnecessary comedic edition to the universe. R2-D2 and C-3PO did a fine job as the comic relief in the original trilogy, without anyone else's help, so why did George feel it so necessary to bring in a whole race of jokes? I personally feel that it cheapened it and lowered the rating, making it more of a film for kids and not for everyone.With that said I do still like it. I can remember the excitement and anticipation of a new film from my favourite franchise. Yes I was nearly 20, but the Original Trilogy had such an epic place in film history and in my house growing up, that there was no way I wouldn't be excited to hear that the story would continue, not only continue, but explain how it had all come to be in the first place. I read the book and even got a pirate copy (which I would never do), before going to see it properly in the cinema. I even bought the action figures, I was that excited. And a lot of that is why I still enjoy the film now. There is a reminiscence of that feeling and the pleasure it gave me at the time, before I became a cynical old man and decided to pick holes in every film that I watch and therefore blame Binks for everything that's wrong with this film.I think the Gungan's could have been played straight and the film would still have been as successful, as well as more appealing to the hardcore fans.I did actually like the nods to the originals - The fact that R2 continues to be the one that saves the day, 3PO is created neurotic and you can see the darkness forming in Anakin even at such an early age. There is a great collection of favourite characters as well as the addition of some new ones. Personally I think that Mace Windu was totally unnecessary and certainly didn't need to be Samuel L. Jackson, in fact there are a few too many big names and they're not all that well directed. I love Ewan, but this is definitely not his best acting on display.A lot of the acting in general is exaggerated and hammy.The CGI is for the most part pretty impressive, but begs a lot of questions about the quality of the beloved 3 that came before it (1977-83) but are set afterwards. The new ships and sets show up the lesser special effects of those that we've always known.I do like the way that I now look at Darth Vader in a different way, having never stopped to think that maybe he had never meant to be a bad guy and only stumbled onto his path. Perhaps that is exactly what George was going for. Their is an alleged original concept story by Lucas somewhere that supposedly covers all 9 films, that I would love to read. I'm desperate to know how true the nonet is to that earlier idea.It's great that a film can make you rethink things after years of believing that Darth just had a dark soul and an evil personality.In the great scheme of things this is not a bad film at all, but for a hardcore Star Wars fan it comes about 7th out of the 11 (Including Solo and Rogue).974.85/1000."", ""The main line of defence seems to be: lighten up, it's just entertainment / just a kid's movie / just a special effects flick. Pausing awhile to note that people who run this line of defence have all but conceded that the film is, in fact, bad, let's take these points one by one - shall we?As entertainment it's poor. Dialogue is flat and perfunctory (don't expect to be dazzled by repartee); the story lacks the beauty of the first Star Wars film and the tension of the second ... and then there's the magical `character development' everyone complains about. We must distinguish character development from character delineation. The former is nice, but the latter is absolutely essential, and it's the latter that's missing from `The Phantom Menace'. Jar Jar, the young Obi Wan, Darth Maul, Armidala, Annakin - all are scarcely characters at all, and are very difficult to get enthused about. Jar Jar in particular is a collection of mannerisms, nothing more. This lack of character doesn't just prevent the film from becoming the darling of the intellectuals - it makes it dull. There are hundreds more entertaining films. Only those people who entered the cinema carrying plastic light sabers, grimly determined to enjoy themselves, failed to notice this.It's a kid's movie. Well, yes, in a sense - but not a good sense. Good children's movies form a proper subset of good movies - simply because adults have access to all childhood emotions and desires, but not vice versa. So in one sense a `kid's movie' is just a movie that can be understood and apperaciated by children (as well as adults). Is this a kid's movie in that sense? Maybe. But it's also a kid's movie in the bad sense: it's deeply witless, and inexperienced children might - I say, MIGHT - fail to notice just how witless it is. Children may - I say, MAY - ignore the fact that Jar Jar Binks is a deeply irritating non-character because he is all colour and movement and he speaks funny. Is this really all we want?Special effects. These aren't so hot, either. George Lucas has fallen in love with computers and failed to notice that his digital animals don't move at all in the way that real animals move - worse still, they don't move like any kind of physical object at all. Nor do most of the alleged physical objects. Compare the trundling white juggernaut at the start of `Star Wars' - a convincingly solid model - with the insubstantial collection of pixels that darts past us at the start of `The Phantom Menace'. The special effects have actually deteriorated, and to make matters worse, there are more of them.So the defence that `The Phantom Menace' is allowed to be a poor movie because it really wasn't trying to be something great in the first place, just won't wash. Especially so, given the ludicrous claims George Lucas has arrogantly made, again and again. So Jar Jar Binks is the first digitally created main character? Rubbish - the dragon in `Dragonheart' predates it (and, one might add, is at the very least a genuine character). So George Lucas is pioneering a new kind of filming-making, more like painting and less like photography, than the old? Absolute twaddle - Walt Disney did THAT in the 1930s. I'll tell you what IS new. Never before has there been so much sizzle, and so little sausage."", ""Honestly I don't get it why so many people hate this movie I can understand it is a bit too long but its not the weakest in the series, the weakest one in the series would have to be episode 2 Attack of the Clones, having too much romance in it. But I think this one is a lot more better then episode 2 in many ways. And also I think Jar Jar Binks is a rather underrated character I know he can be annoying at times but he did play a large role in this film which fans are missing the point. The pod race is problay the best scene in this whole film as it was rather enjoyable to watch over and over again on youtube. Soundtrack is amazing and very well done for this movie. I know some people hate this movie just because of one character but come on give this movie another chance it will surprised you in many ways. overall Episode 1 is rather underrated and needs another chance 8/10"", 'I know it\'s fashionable to scorn the ""prequel"" trilogy, but if one stands back a bit, things tend to snap into perspective. Compare ""Phantom Menace"" to most any other fantasy/sci-fi film, and it has to rate very high indeed.Plot: this is the more ""adult"" side of the Star Wars galaxy. The politics are remarkably credible, with the entire plot hinging on the result of a vote of no-confidence! How many adults even know what that is? (Hmm... maybe this explains the low ratings.) The relationships between the races on Naboo, the role of the Jedi... these things are established more clearly, and depicted more credibly than in any of the other five films.Technical achievement: Lucas paints on a vast digital canvas, and creates a world of wonders that have simply never been imagined by lesser talents. This is a living, breathing, believable world, that makes the world of the original trilogy seem cartoonish and contrived by comparison. Naboo, from the city, to the underwater kingdom, to the rolling green hills, is one of the great fantasy worlds, up there with those of the Thief of Baghdad (both versions), Blade Runner, or 2001. And our first glimpse of Coruscant has got to be one of the most memorable ""wow"" moments in the history of the movies.Characters: Liam Neeson\'s Qui Gon is one of the strongest characters in the Star Wars films, and Ewan McGregor\'s Obi Wan a worthy, more-dashing successor to the older version created by Alec Guinness. And Jar Jar Binks? Annoying? Not compared to the insipid C-3PO, or the insufferably perky R2-D2. Jar Jar is a fully formed character, with surprising depths. His manner is odd, perhaps abrasive, but he offers far more than the single note that Lucas used for his original comic-relief characters. And, of course, the fact that he is one of the first fully digital characters in film history has to be worth something. But Ian McDiarmid\'s Senator Palpatine is perhaps the most under-appreciated of all. This is an Oscar-worthy supporting performance, a character who is both frighteningly real and perfectly ambiguous. McDiarmid balances his performance on a knife\'s edge, managing to be both fatherly and deeply unsettling.Yes, it may be that a certain human dimension is weaker here than in the original Star Wars. We don\'t have a clear ""hero"". There\'s no Luke, no Han. That\'s a valid point, but it is not inevitably a criticism. Qui Gon and Obi Wan aren\'t the comic-book heroes of A New Hope, but they are likable, heroic, and rich in characterization. If I had a choice between seeing 10 more episodes of the life of Han Solo or of Qui Gon Jinn, I\'d choose the latter without hesitation.Story: The storyline in this film seems more real, more substantial than in the other five. We have the perfect sense of scale, from human drama to global (or interstellar) conflict. The one quibble might be the pod race. It\'s certainly entertaining, but does it go on too long? I think perhaps so. This is a structural weakness, but not a huge one. (Does Luke spend WAY too long on Dagobah, listening to warmed over Zen platitudes from that rubbery little jerk Yoda? Yes! Yet this is in the film most viewers seem to, unaccountably, pick as the ""best"" of the six. Clearly, there\'s some latitude for narrative digressions...)And then there\'s the climactic sword fight. I\'d rate the three-way duel in Phantom Menace as the second-best sword fight in the Star Wars series, close after the finale of Return of the Jedi. The latter has a wonderful mythic quality, but this one is more visceral, more scary... partly because Darth Maul is such a cold, merciless villain, and partly because you know from the outset that the outcome is genuinely in doubt, that one of the Good Guys really could die. And the staging, using three master swordsmen, each with very different technique... This is just about as good as action film gets. Only two or three other movie duels come close: Rob Roy, again with Neeson, oddly enough; Scaramouche; Robin Hood... I can\'t think of a fourth. The closing duel ALONE should raise Phantom Menace into the front ranks of action and fantasy films.Bottom line: there is so much to enjoy in this film, so much to see, so much to feel, that it is amazing how anyone can possibly rate it below a 7 or 8. This is a scale of film making that few have ever attempted, let alone pulled off so beautifully. Perhaps that\'s the film\'s biggest fault: Lucas makes it all seem too easy.But, of course, we all know the REAL reason people can\'t give this film the 10 it richly deserves. That reason lies within themselves. Viewers in 1999 (let alone 2007) just couldn\'t feel as young, as innocent, as optimistic as they did when they saw the very first Star Wars. (Especially if they saw it way back in 1977, 30 years ago). Star Wars hasn\'t changed, George Lucas hasn\'t changed, nearly so much as the audience has changed. Alas. Moviegoers who are truly so jaded that they can\'t feel the passion and revel in the breadth of vision of The Phantom Menace have my sincerest sympathy. Yes, you can be ever so-o cool by putting down the prequel trilogy, but missing one of the best movies of all time is a very high price to pay.', '""Episode I: The Hidden Menace"" is perhaps the most ambiguous film in George W. Lucas\'s ""Star Wars"" series. Met by the rather coldly stern gaze of critics, the first film of the new trilogy can cause some confusion in the viewer. There are not many action scenes in it, there are many dialogues and just a leisurely development of actions, which sometimes may seem like a forced filler with a connecting function between fights and races. But this is only at first glance, because if you look closely ...Young Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and his teacher, Qui-Gon Jin (Liam Neeson), go to negotiations with the Trade Federation, which threatens to blockade the peaceful little planet of Naboo. In Obi-Wan\'s eyes, his mind and vision are already visible, his movements are already full of courage and confidence. Confidence and powerful, unquestioning dedication are seen in the young queen Amidala (Natalie Portman) that she is ready to do anything to help her people, the inhabitants of the occupied world federation. It is in ""The Phantom Menace"" most accurately and correctly disclose the nature and fragile at the same time in BOGATYRSKY solid Padme: it is able to stand alone against the decision of the Senate, venturing recklessly brave adventures and combine intuitive dictates of the heart with equanimity of mind.Qui-Gon Jin is unshakable and calm, in whatever situation he was. His eyes radiate wisdom and strength, a smile condescendingly reasonable, and the movements are smooth and weighed. But the main feature of Obi-Wan\'s teacher is not in these, of course, the most important qualities. Qui-Gon, first of all, is a man of exceptional faith. Some of his actions seem too risky and thoughtless, but somewhere in general they can be mistaken for a desperate bluff. But for him, extremely sensitive to everything around him, holding in an unsurpassed harmony the awareness of his own forces and the sense of difficulty of the tasks set, for him, who knows how to feel the situation on many, many forward steps, faith is the main tool. With her help, he stands unshakably on his feet, seeking his own, by all means.Once having set a goal - to certainly train quite a young Anakin Skywalker - Qui-Gon will go to her persistently and steadily. He alone believes in the Prophecy of the great destiny of the boy, as if he did not hear the fears of the Jedi Council that Anakin\'s uncertain future could pose great troubles to the Galaxy. But the foresight and the unique sense of Qui-Gon\'s world allow him to see far further than to his eminent like-minded people and mentors, like Master Yoda and Master Windu. In addition, an extraordinary faith allows Qui-Gon to destroy any of his fears and doubts that can obscure his clear eyes. The moment of the film is very important, in which the wise Jedi tells Anakin about the medichlorians, micro-organisms existing in symbiosis with the cells of any living organism. Perhaps, in these mysterious media chlorians lies the human soul, elusive to the eye and non-existent for touch. Then the wise counsel of Qui-Gon Jinn and unselfish greed deprived the boy Anakin Skywalker, wanted to visit every planet in the universe, it seems quite clear and sharp, Go up to the call of the heart, and you go on the right path. And even though this road is lost in the darkness of the gathering clouds, there will always be someone who sees a little farther than everyone else, and builds on this sagacity its most powerful faith. Qui-Gon believed in Anakin from the first second and believed in him to the end; most likely he understood the suffering and upheavals that promised further training of the boy for the Galaxy and for himself, but in one thing he was certain that in the final analysis Skywalker would return the Force to equilibrium ...Finishing on the major note of universal jubilation and festivities, ""Episode I: The Hidden Menace"" at first glance does not justify its mysterious and menacing title. But, having looked a little closer, we see that the holiday is just a calm before the storm, and a sweet truce is a tricky tactical ploy. It also becomes clear with horror that all the actions of all the heroes are quite comparable with the freedom to choose the actions of puppets tied to strong threads, for which someone is confidently pulling, able to control the movements of dolls by the easy fingering.And the violent protest of Padme Amidaly at the Senate meeting, and the murder of the mighty Darth Moule, and the fiasco of the Trade Federation, and the heroic death of Qui-Gon Gin, are all foggings in the plan of the mysterious strategist who is still hiding far from the battlefields, its galactic war. And Anakin Skywalker\'s aching lead heart, which is filled with a burning, drying fear after the death of a Jedi so much loved by him, also lies in a small coin, albeit of a larger value than the rest, on a comprehensive battle map of the devilish clever and cunning puppeteer. The beginning of the saga is laid, the heroes are represented, the plot knots are tied. Star Wars Beginning', 'I loved this movie as a kid. I still love it at age 21. Sure, it can be a bit sloppy at times, and it switches from plot a to plot b constantly.The stereotypes can be jarring at times. But you know what, it is still brilliant. The characters are likable. Even jar jar is not that bad. The acting is OK. Not great, but OK. The hate seems to stem from old trilogy fans, not knowing that this film was merely trying to be something different. Yes, if you want a film that feels like the old trilogy, this is not for you. But if you are looking for a fast-paced, lighthearted sci-fi action movie with one or two smart scenes, good scenery, and interesting alien designs, then this is for you.', 'Positives: Planets designSome of the action scenesDarth MaulMusical scoreNegatives: StoryPacingCharactersActingWritingDull cinematography', ""For 6 months I longed to watch Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace, and for 133 minutes I was absolutely blown away with how well the movie was put together. I saw it on opening day of course, and I now understand why I have waited so long to write a review of it. If I had written this review right after I watched the movie, I would have written a review influenced by the months and months of anticipation. I feel now, after 17 months and countless 1000's of times watching all or some of the movie, I now feel that I can review this film free of influence.***Warning, this review is full of spoilers!***The Phantom Menace is a film that had virtually years between conception and completion and it's a horrible shame that they spent most of that time deciding whom to cast. On top of that, it now is clear to me that George Lucas spent much of the time filming this movie on certain parts, and not enough on others. For instance, the pod-racing scene is unbelievably awesome, and it is evident that Lucas spent a long period of time on this scene alone. The final battle between Qui-Gon Jin, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Darth Maul is another prime example, I mean just to think up something like the long corridor with those strategically placed force fields must have took a lot of time and imagination. On the other hand, scenes like when Qui-Gon is explaining to Anikin what the `force' is should have been a little more elaborate, and in this case re-written and re-shot. Casting was, for the most part, well thought out. In the usual \x91Star Wars' way, the main actors and actresses were not the usual $20 million dollar actors and actresses. In choosing Liam Neeson for the role of Qui-Gon Jin was anything but dull, and Ewan McGregor as the already introduced Obi-Wan Kenobi was even more brilliant. When choosing the eventual mother of Luke Skywalker (Queen Amidala), Natalie Portman was a unique choice. Even having the impressive Samuel L. Jackson in this movie was a great chance to see him along side Yoda. As I am pleased with all the previous choices, the most important of casting decisions in the past few years was not thought out well enough. Jake Lloyd was horribly miscast in the role of Anikin Skywalker. It almost hurt to listen to him present his lines.  From the first `Uh oh, this isn't good..' to the `I'm going to be a jedi knight?' his delivery is incredibly lacking of feeling. I would have to say that Jake Lloyd alone is a big part of why this movie will get a lower than usual rating from this viewer. As far as the villains in this movie, and there were many, Darth Maul must have sounded great on paper, but there must have been much lost in the translation onto the screen. He is neither terrifying, nor powerful like the eventual Darth Vader will be. Not until the final battle scene do we begin to somewhat fear him. Throughout the first three movies, we learned piece by piece about Darth Vader. We hated him since we first were introduced to him in \x91Hope', and we grew to love him by the end of \x91Jedi'. The problem with \x91Menace' and Darth Maul, is that he wasn't introduced until at least 30 minutes into the film, and we never learned anything about him. The movie was indeed full of action, and I especially liked the use of CGI alongside the natural environments. The decision to include Jar Jar Binks, and fully computerized sidekick, was not necessarily a bad one, I just think that a few of his lines were a bit irrelevant to the story. I especially like Watto, and the scene with him and Qui-Gon Jin discussing payment for the part to Qui-Gon's ship.The use of \x91wipe' transition from scene to scene is a classic \x91Star Wars' piece. The lighting is also unique to the \x91Star Wars' family of movies, as is the bland good vs. evil plot. If not for the pod racing scene (roughly reincarnated from Ben Hur), and the final three-way fight scene, \x91Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace' would have earned a disappointingly low grade due to the lack of casting, and very obvious rush to get the movie completed.Please let this be known, this is the most expensive ($115 million) independent film ever created. It was fully funded by George Lucas himself. With this said, \x91Episode I' is not a bad film by any stretch of the imagination, just an average sci-fi film that just happens to have the words \x91Star Wars' in the title. After all this I must admit that I, once again, will probably be waiting for months to see the next film on opening day; let's just hope that we wont be let down again."", ""Almost as good if not better than the original trilogy, fanboys can never be satisfied unless it's a cheap rehash of the original (The Force Awakens). Through dazzling visual effects for the time expanding the universe and including some of the best action scenes in the franchise till then, this is a thoroughly entertaining film. It does have a lot of flaws but none more than the original trilogy had, just different, fanboys ought to grow up."", 'Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace is written, produced and directed by George Lucas and stars Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Jake Lloyd and Ian McDiarmid. The fourth film released in the Star Wars franchise, it is, however, the first of three prequels that lead up to Star Wars that was released in 1977. Plot basically follows Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn (Neeson) and his apprentice padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi (McGregor), who escort and protect Queen Amidala (Portman) from Naboo to Coruscant in the hope of finding peace as an interplanetary trade dispute starts to boil over. During the journey the party stops over at Tatooine and encounter a young boy named Anakin Skywalker. The Jedi feel the force is strong with young Skywalker and enlist him into the group with the intention of training him to become a Jedi Knight. Meanwhile, as hostilities escalate in the galaxy, the mysterious Sith is moving into the equation.The most anticipated movie of all time arrived in 1999, hyped into the stratosphere, the fanfare and bunting stretched from Hollywood to the far corners of the cinema loving world. Perhaps unsurprisingly? The Phantom Menace failed to meet the expectation of Star Wars fans and critics alike. That the film in box office receipts alone made almost $930 million, has, tended to be forgotten. But that\'s not to say the film deserved such rich financial rewards, because all told it didn\'t. It\'s not a great film by any stretch of the imagination, but it is a fun movie experience, and in retrospect it can be said that Lucas and co learnt from the film to make the next two film\'s in the series better. Mistakes were made, for sure, but for action and intrigue the film scores points well enough.On a personal note, I was one of the fans who came out of the cinema after watching it the first time and hated it. So whilst I wasn\'t one of the ""fans"" who at the time accused Lucas of ruining childhood memories, I was suitably annoyed to stay away from the film for over ten years. After the prequel trilogy had run its course, I was often asked by some film loving friends to give ""Menace"" another go. Their argument was that free of hype and expectation, ""Menace"" can really be enjoyed as a sort of popcorn and beer sci-fi blockbuster. And they were right. Watching it sparkle in HD and disassociating it with those golden memories of 77, 80 and 83, it has much to enjoy. Sure the old problems still exist, dodgy acting (why is McGregor playing it so fey?), Binks (aargh), fart gags (really Mr. Lucas? Really?), close to the knuckle racial stereotyping and the absence of a Hans Solo type to stir the blood of both sexes. While of course the writing is borderline tepid, full of a need to explain things and prove itself as a reason to exist. So yes, full of flaws (many others exist for different people of course), but the whizz bangery of the action and set pieces keep it, to my mind, far away from stinker status.The pod race, a souped up extension to Return of the Jedi\'s speed-biker pursuits, is one of the series\' highlights, as is the showdown between Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan and Darth Maul (Ray Park), a superbly cool villain with an even cooler double ended light sabre. The latter of which is excellently scored by John Williams and features top notch choreography. The battles widen the eyes and the ears, notably the Droid army versus the Gungan\'s, and there\'s a whole host of new creatures and aliens to get acquainted with (check out those underwater beasties). The charge of CGI overkill is a fair one, and this issue is a more prominent problem in standard HD, never mind the Blu-ray, as the non human characters look too obviously CGI next to the human\'s. Which is just another reason to pick apart what\'s wrong with the Phantom Menace. But why do that? Sit back, relax, munch some snacks and sip that beer, it\'s not that bad a movie experience. Honestly. 7/10', ""The problems George Lucas had, when he began to piece together the prequel trilogy to the Epic Star Wars Saga are as follows - 1/ He's tied into a story that all the original fans already know, leaving him less scope for his ideas than he had before.2/ He made such a fine job of the original movies, the fans will expect more of the same.3/ He has to appeal to a new generation of Star Wars fans, and without the Impact of Groundbreaking special effects, its harder this time round. (Face it, Great special effects are seen in adverts these days)So, evidently we end up with an inferior movie, but thankfully it's still a good one. Lucas has still managed to bring in some new characters, he has created some memorable scenes (the Pod Race scene is superb) and above all he's begun to fill in some background to the characters we Star Wars fans know and love, R2, C3PO, Obi-Wan and Yoda. I believe more time could have spent on some of the new characters build up, but he only has 3 films to reach the point where Star Wars started off, and there is a lot of story to cover.There are some flaws in the film, but there is enough here to entertain you, and George is just warming up.One thing i was massively impressed with, and strangely it was the movies biggest let down at the same time, Darth Maul and his truly brilliant light-sabre battle with Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon. The question is why not have more of him in the movie? But who am i to question George Lucas's motives.8/10 Nice Effort, on a difficult first outing."", ""It's hard to take off your nostalgia glasses when going back to a movie that is such a strong memory from the past, but today, as an adult I went back and watched this movie.It's still good.And most surprisingly, my time watching it flew by. Whereas with TFA and TLJ could drag on. I think a sign of any good movie is how strongly it pulls you in, and makes you forget about the world around you. This movie didn't fail that for me. Even more so, I think the popularization of this movie and the jokes/memes around it made it even more interesting to watch. The quotes, scenes and jokes land so much better now. I could see how anyone who saw the originals would hate this shift in tone in the prequels. But I loved the cheesiness of it, but it didn't lack heart either! Anakin leaving his mother, Qui Gon Jinn's death are great emotional moments.Now the most controversial character in all of star wars, Jar Jar Binks, the epitome of a utterly stupid character. In general I did not hate his antics, my only issue with Jar Jar was the amount of times he was used in intense action scenes, especially where the Gungars face the Droids on Naboo. There would just so many scenes of Binks being clumsy and somehow disabling a ton of droids it took out the emergence of the scene. And the fact many of his own people where being killed. Aside from that he was fine as a comic relief, and it was needed as he was the only one in the movie that wasn't all too serious. He was just edited in a bit too much.Aside from that, yeah some visuals are pretty damn bad and didn't age well. But honestly it didn't at all bother me aside from 2-3 scenes. The Pod Racing cgi is still great to this day. The droids sometimes look great, other times.. not so. And the Gungars... the biggest offenders pretty much look awful..all the time. But then again, it was 2001.The editing at times was a little odd as well, mainly during the main fight with Maul. The flow in that fight was weird in some places, and definitely right before Qui died. The saber effects also show their age. Although I tried pretty hard, I couldn't see many ''phantom'' hits whilst viewing. So even though I sawa those reviews and analysis videos where they show them hitting nothing at certain points.. I didn't see it in realtime.The acting.. is alright, Padmé, Qui and Obi are great, but the others are very much flat and dry. Chancellor Palpatine had some good lines, but the memes around it might have tainted me a bit.TLDR: All in all, I was afraid going into this movie because I thought I would HATE it now as an adult versus me as a little kid loving the fantasy spectacle. But no, its still good to this day, and after seeing TFA and TLJ, this definitely still beats those two in my opinion."", ""STAR WARS EPISODE ONE: THE PHANTOM MENACE. cue the John Williams theme music.

Liam Neeson is simply the whole movie Darth Maul's evil look might've been a publicist's dream but Qui gon jinn is the heart of the movie and Ewen Macgregor simply wonderful as Kenobi. The movie never earned all the basing it got it's about as wonderful a time as you will ever have reliving your childhood or watching a grand adventure movie. The Phantom menace is one of the best in this genre ."", 'With all the voices and opinions and critical ravings about The Phantom Menace, I am sure that one more voice weighing in ain\'t gonna make that much of a ripple. But I am a committed fan (in the sense of being devoted, not insane), and I feel the need at least to declare publicly my admiration for Lucas\' latest work, and also a few of my concerns.Overall, Episode One ranks above Episode Six, about par with Episode Four, but certainly nowhere near the grandeur and wit of Episode Five. Phantom Menace reminds me of something someone said of Citizen Kane: A hollow masterpiece. PM is technically brilliant, yet it is so technically brilliant that it lacks a certain ""human"" warmth. To me, the best moments were those intimate, interpersonal moments--Padme giving Anakin a blanket, Qui-Gon placing his hands on Anakin\'s shoulders in the Jedi temple, and ESPECIALLY all those moments with Shmi Skywalker, Anakin\'s mother.In an interview in Premiere Magazine, Liam Neeson gave a telling anecdote that illustrates my point. First, he noted that Lucas was reticent to give the actors any motivation for lines, expressions, or anything. In other words, Lucas simply expected the actors to say lines devoid of emotional content, as if the post-production could somehow invest emotional motivation. Neeson revealed that it took him a long time to convince Lucas to allow Qui-Gon to place a hand on Shmi\'s shoulder after he convinces her to allow him to take Anakin away to Coruscant. That hand on the shoulder was probably the BEST moment in that film, a sign of human connection in a swirling clash of galactic politics gone awry.Traces of post-production fiddling is evidenced most forcefully with Jake Lloyd\'s Anakin. Watch carefully his scenes at the dinner table, sitting with Qui-Gon at night, and saying goodbye to his mother. Those scenes were clearly doctored in post-production; I believe Lucas took different takes of Lloyd saying lines and splicing those with Pernilla August\'s. Pay special attention to Anakin after Shmi says, ""He can help you, he was meant to help you."" Anakin\'s face is clearly digitally manipulated to turn sideways. The first time I noticed it (it was the fourth time I\'ve seen the film) I was taken aback. It was so blatant I began to wonder what other bits were modified that way.On the plus side: Lucas can weave a wonderfully rich narrative tapestry. I love that all this begins with a trade dispute. A trade dispute! Complete with procedural wranglings in a galactic senate rife with corruption and bureaucracy (watch for the cameo appearance of Spielberg\'s ETs) and a sinister Darth Sidious pulling the political strings. It\'s the perfect smokescreen to disguise the rise of an evil empire. Every step of the plot has the look of careful craftsmanship; every twist and turn of the plot had relevance.The costumes are outstanding, especially Queen Amidala\'s Asian-influenced wardrobe. John Williams has certainly outdone himself with the soundtrack, particularly ""Duel of the Fates,"" which introduces choral voices into the Star Wars musical repertoire, ominous voices that sometimes hiss and sometimes howl the forboding Sanskrit text. The production design and cinematography (both real and CGI) create vistas of unparalleled beauty and richness: from the Italianate arches and domes on Naboo, to the art nouveau-inspired underwater air-globes of the Gungans, to the dramatic cityscapes of Coruscant. I can see Academy Awards next year for all these achievements . . .Despite its many drawbacks, I am drawn continually to rewatch The Phantom Menace: for its artistry, for its lines (""There\'s always a bigger fish""), for those rare human moments, and to soak in this latest addition to the Star Wars text. Yes, the wrapper might be a tad bit flashier than the present inside, but its a gift given with a lot of heart and the best of intentions.', 'Just as older generations grew up with the original Star Wars movies, I grew up with the prequel series. Star Wars is not known for its twisted plot and complexity, nor the complex characters development and logical events, but for the epic atmosphere and charming and memorable characters; this characteristic applies to all 6 movies. I really don\'t get the hate for Jar Jar Binks; I actually liked this silly concept; silliness is being present in all the Star Wars movies anyway. For me, the new Star Wars prequel series are just as good as the older ones; I also take them on a personal level \'cause I really enjoyed them when I was... smaller. What annoys me the most is that people say this is as bad as other modern Hollywood movies that are really crappy: ""Narnia"", ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" etc; please stop or I\'ll catch the CopperCab frenzy and insult you all!!! TOO LATE! Attention haters!! I\'ll make videos on YouTube dedicated to all Star Wars prequels haters! And I mean business because I\'m not even a ginger! Seriously, stop complaining, just enjoy it without thinking too much!', ""'Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace'. A movie, which has a difficult standing in the fan community. For me, not understandable, because I really like the movie and it's a successful prelude to the formerly new trilogy.Admittedly, the movie has weaknesses. First of all, the hair-raising attempt to explain what 'the force' is. Qui-Gon tries to explain to Anakin that there are Midi-Chlorianes which are the basis and the reason for everything. Anakin replies that he doesn't understand what Qui-Gon is trying to explain to him. Thereupon Qui-Gon lets it rest and the scene is over. Of course, you wonder what that was all about. So either you explain it correctly or you leave it completely. But so the whole thing seems really unnecessary.The entire storyline is unnecessarily complex and I have to admit that I didn't really understand it. You do have the feeling that you can understand the motivation of the respective characters, but the entire political plot is not 100% clear. It seems like an overambitious attempt to get seriousness into the movie.Jar Jar Binks. Here, you realize that the movie was made for a younger audience. Jar Jar is an attempt to be funny in a childish and clumsy way. It wouldn't have needed it. However, I didn't find it really disturbing either.These are points of criticism, but they only bother me to a limited extent. Episode I has so many strong moments. The whole act of introducing Anakin, the way Tatooine is portrayed, the really well staged pot race. All these moments know how to convince.The chemistry between Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan is brilliant. And while we're on the subject of characters, Darth Maul is for me one of the best antagonists there is. The few scenes with him manage to build a mystical aura around him. The fight between these three characters is outstanding as well.Episode I is hard to compare to the first Star Wars movies. And it is precisely this comparison that is Episode I's undoing. The movie were made at a different time, have a different tone and of course it can't be denied that this movie was also made for a younger audience.For me, Episode I did what Episode IV did for many others. To ignite enthusiasm for the Star Wars universe."", ""When I was a small kid, I used to wonder what the Star Wars universe was all about. Imperial soldiers, droids, flying spaceships and starfighters, Jedi Knights, Darth Vader, etc. I was curious with all of these stuff but when I watched all the three Star Wars movies, I began to understand what George Lucas, the creator of the popular sci-fi saga itself, was trying to accomplish: explore the awe and wonders of our ever expanding universe. And now, 22 years after the release of the first movie, George Lucas and his entire crew at Lucasfilm bring the most anticipated movie of 1999, Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace. I am truly impressed with this incredible film despite its noticeable flaws. The evil Trade Federation has stopped all shipping to the peaceful planet of Naboo. To resolve that matter, the Galactic Republic decides to dispatch the two Jedi Knights, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn to the Trade Federation Battleship to arrange a negotiation with the Neimodians. Unfortunately for our heroes, the negotiation never takes place and so they fight face-to-face with thousands of battle droids, escape to Naboo, and there they meet the annoying yet kind-hearted Gungan, Jar Jar Binks as well as the beautiful Queen Amidala (ok, I know some of you out there complaint about her make-up). Later, our heroes meet Anakin Skywalker, a mysterious boy who is believed to bring the Balance to the Force. In my opinion, Anakin is such a cool person because he is a great podracer who never wins a single match until his recent confrontation with rival Sebulba (he is going to fly a Naboo starfighter too during the battle of Naboo. Bravo to Jake Lloyd!). You need to see the rest of the film if you haven't watched one yet. Episode I: The Phantom Menace is a very enjoyable movie that may even attract those who are not widely known to the Star Wars universe. I especially like the locations on some planets (the Naboo Palace and the wondrous city of Coruscant) as well as its awesome special effects. To heighten up the action, Darth Maul makes an incredible performance during the climatic battle with the Jedi Knights. However, I never say that The Phantom Menace is a 100% perfect movie. The storyline is pretty weak (gee, I wonder what George Lucas is thinking) and some characters aren't well developed. Still, this IS just only the beginning, and perhaps there will be a major improvement by the time Episode II is released."", '""Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace"" was probably one of the most anticipated movie of the last couple of decades. Because of the whole hype around it, it could only disappoint and it was no surprise that lot\'s of people eventually were disappointed. I have to admit that even I was disappointed a bit. The first time I saw it in the cinema I would had probably rated it a 7/10 but the second time I saw it in the cinema (yes, a real Star Wars fan doesn\'t watch a Star Wars movie just once in cinema :P), I already began to appreciate it more. It really is a movie that grows onto you. I\'m now at the point were I\'m loving this movie and see it as a great addition to the Star Wars saga. Granted that it\'s not the perfect beginning of the series but it certainly is a entertaining and beautiful movie. If this would had been the first Star Wars movie that had been made, I\'m sure it would had been received way better than it did now. There are two things in this movie that make me consider this a great movie; The podrace and the duel of the fates. Those two parts in the movie make this is science-fiction classic. Yes, sure the podrace was totally inspired by the ""Ben-Hur"" chariot race scene and therefor it\'s not the most original sequence in movie history but it has been made with lot\'s of profession and excellent special effect supported by the John Williams soundtrack. It should get your adrenaline really flowing. And even the biggest Star Wars hater has to admit that the duel of the fates is spectacular. It simply is the best lightsaber fight of all the Star Wars movies so far (Maybe the Obi-Wan/Anakin lightsaber fight is going to be even better?). It mainly is spectacular thanks to Ray Park as Darth Maul. His moves are incredible and something totally different than we were used to from the the other three firstly made Star Wars movies.Then why is ""Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace"" not a perfect movie? Well, there are several problems. One is the at times weak dialog. The other is of course the character Jar Jar Binks but maybe the biggest problem is Jake Lloyd as the young Anakin Skywalker. He plays very inconsistent. In the one scene he is perfect and in the other he is just simply awful. Some words of comfort for Jake; he is not the worst actor in this movie. Ralph Brown is even more horrible as Ric Olié AKA Captain Obvious but also Pernilla August was pretty awful at times. Thankfully the rest of the cast is casted very well and there are some wonderful newly added characters. There have always been lot\'s of critic on the casting of the new Star Wars movies but I don\'t think that always has been completely fair. After all the movie has several Academy Award nominees (Samuel L. Jackson, Natalie Portman, Liam Neeson, Terence Stamp) and it should get credit for casting Keira Knightley who hardly had been in any movies before appearing in this movie, in a fairly large role. Keira Knightley now is one of the biggest and fastest rising Hollywood stars of this decade. It also is great to see that some of the actors from the first made Star Wars movies are back to star in this movie (Frank Oz, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker, Ian McDiarmid). There also are some new great characters like Watto, Sebulba and the previously mentioned Darth Maul with his cool make-up and moves.The movie is very good non-stop entertainment in a good quick pace and come to think of it, it might very well the most entertaining Star Wars movie of them all. The special effects and make-up and costumes are top-class (even though Yoda looks horrible) and the icing on the cake is the musical score from John Williams. The movie is mainly fun and it has some spectacular moments. Also the lightsaber fight/droid battle/space fight ending will not disappoint you even though the space fight is the worst of all the Star Wars movies. But I think that says more about the other Star Wars movies than about this movie. Actually the fact that most people were disappointed with this movie says more about the other Star Wars movies than about this one, for this really is a great highly entertaining, nearly perfect movie for the entire family.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/', 'After a long delay (and much anticipation) we finally got the first part of Lucas\'s story, and where the trouble all began. Many other people viewed it as a rather sub-par attempt, uncreative and unsurprising. I couldn\'t disagree more. One could go with the impressive state-of-the-art digital effects, one could go with the great cast of new characters (the awesome Liam Neeson as Qui-Gon Jinn, for instance), the return of old favorites (Kenny Baker as R2D2 or Frank Oz as Yoda), John Williams\' ever-wonderful score, the complicated story (I won\'t bother discussing the plot; everyone knows what it\'s about by now) or the awesome action sequences (the light saber duel at the end of the film is the best!). It\'s obvious this film was misunderstood by many, and too many movie-goers set their expectations too high, which is unfair to Mr. Lucas to say the least. I was excited for the chance to see a new Star Wars film, but I took no expectations into the theater with me -- I went in ready for nothing and walked away very satisfied. I saw this film four times in the theater, something I don\'t do much of these days. Lucas did a great job, and since this film is really only exposition for the overall series, how can one expect it to be a topper to the original trilogy? He\'s just setting everything up! Give Mr. Lucas a break. If this film had been released first, it would have been the rage of ages just as A New Hope was when it first came out. Everything in this film was very nicely done; the cast and crew all performed their jobs exceptionally. The story was far more complex and interesting than usual, with more going on and more problems to solve. By the way, everyone, the ""Phantom Menace"" referred to by the title is so obvious that very few people truly understood what it was... the Phantom Menace was the orchestrator of the evil deeds, the driving force behind the attacks, the central villain of the picture... a character we see mainly as a hologram (only once otherwise): Darth Sidious. Darth Sidious is the Phantom Menace, and the evil single man who drives the entire plot. The movie was perfectly named. I loved this movie, and it has become one of my favorite Star Wars films (alongside A New Hope). I can\'t wait for Episode II!', ""I saw the Phantom Menace for the first time when I was 5 years old, and I remember being blown away by what I had watched. It was fantastic through the eyes of a child, something George was clearly trying to do. Now I am an adult, and watching it through the eyes of one, I can see all the mistakes, but that does not make the movie bad.For one, Star Wars has always been a series that has been aimed at children. Yes adults like it also, but Star Wars is not just popular for its films, but for its video games, toys and books. Most of which are for children. This film was great and it showed one of the best adventures of the 90s. When people complain about this film, their excuse is usually the same: too much CGI, poor acting and poor writing and poor direction.Yes the CGI is a bit dated, but it was really spectacular in some scenes. The acting was great in this film, as it was in the next two. The only actor who didn't give the best, was the young Jake Lloyd. It would be unfair to criticise the performance of someone who was a child at the time, of course he was not going to give a Al Pacino performance. The writing is OK, I guess, but really ask yourself this - what Star Wars film has good writing? None. They all have fantastic stories, which is why people love these films so much.George did a great job at expanding on his already loved saga. He gave us new worlds, new characters and showed us the Jedi Order, something we have been wanting to see for a long time. This film is a joyful adventure, with a great story.The character of Jar Jar is often another point of hate from 'older fans'. 'OLDER' fans. To a child, Jar Jar is a funny, clumsy stupid alien who acts insane, much like many Disney cartoon characters. I have a child of my own, and she thinks Jar Jar is hilarious, she is always pointing and laughing at him. THIS IS WHAT GEORGE WANTED! This film will always be criticised by people who just don't like it, or don't want to like it. But this is not a bad film. It starts of an adventure which would eventually lead to episode 6, and the future movies. Star Wars Episode 1 The Phantom Menace is a great film and a fantastic science-fiction movie.9.6/10"", ""When I went to see The Phantom Menace, I was almost uncontrollably excited. I loved the original Star Wars trilogy, and was hugely anticipating the new trilogy. To my immense delight, I thought that The Phantom Menace was a brilliant film.In some respects, I can see why people dislike The Phantom Menace. Yes, there are some wooden performances (eyes on you, Natalie Portman). Yes, the dialogue is clunky. But I don't really think that Oscar-worthy performances and exceptional writing are what the Star Wars saga is about. In my opinion, it is more about grand and epic storytelling, which this film accomplishes extremely well.The visuals are the film's best asset. George Lucas creates brand new worlds for us to gasp in awe at, with such detail and creativity put into creating the environments that it is hard to believe that you can't reach out and feel them. The crew deserve tremendous applause for such an incredibly creative accomplishment. Each world has its own individual character. Whereas Coruscant is a sprawling, busy capital, Tatooine is unfriendly and barren. The visual effects are terrific, and you find yourself indulging on almost every detail.However, it wouldn't be a great Star Wars movie without action, and Phantom Menace delivers two scorching set pieces. The first is a frenetically furious pod race, in which the racers shoot through dangerous terrain, all the time trying to avoid dirty tricks from their competitors and unfriendly fire from unhappy campers. The race is brilliantly gripping, keeping you on the edge of your seat from the heart-stopping beginning to the cheer-worthy ending. As with almost every scene in the movie, the race is also jam-packed with clever details, drawing you in closer to the action.The second is a pulse-raising three-way lightsaber fight between Qui-Gon Jinn (the excellent Liam Neeson), Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and Darth Maul (athlete Ray Park). This lightsaber duel conquers all of the previous duels in the series, and is absolutely terrific. It is fantastically exciting to finally see such a fast-paced, brutal and energetic lightsaber fight, where the combatants seem perfectly fluent and are fighting with every ounce of their strength. This sequence is a classic sword fight, which will always be in my mind when anyone mentions Star Wars.In addition to the fantastic action, there is another phenomenal score from John Williams. He provides several breath-taking new tunes (the highlight is Duel of The Fates, which is played during the lightsaber fight), yet also offers foreshadowing of future events in the saga by using tunes from the original films. Despite the fact that the performers are hindered by undoubtedly clunky dialogue, quite a few of them manage to turn in decent performances. Neeson gives a noble and powerful performance as Qui-Gon Jinn, fully emphasising the perfect image of a Jedi master. Ewan McGregor provides a few moments of brilliant emotional clarity, whilst Jake Lloyd gives a passable portrayal of future Darth Vader, Anakin Skywalker. But the best performance comes from Pernilla August, who gives a performance of great grace and vulnerability as Anakin's mother.George Lucas handles all of the proceedings with consummate skill. He has made some mistakes in the screenplay, but he has ensured to the best of his ability that he is able to grant us a compelling and engaging vision of the Star Wars galaxy. He has had some low points in his career, but on a creative scale, this certainly isn't one of them. He directs the film passionately and without remorse, which earns him my deepest respect.This is a brilliant fantasy movie. It may not be as dark as the fans were hoping for, but it is still successful in terms of its creativity, its visual effects and its action."", 'The opening crawl reveals that the Trade Federation, led by its viceroy, Nute Gunray, has blockaded the planet of Naboo in hope of resolving a galactic trade dispute. Chancellor Valorum (Terence Stamp) of the Galactic Republic, sends Jedi Knights Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) on a secret mission to meet with the Trade Federation to settle the crisis. Unknown to them, the Trade Federation is in league with the mysterious Sith Lord Darth Sidious, who orders them to invade Naboo with their immense droid army and also to kill the two Jedi. Following a failed attempt to force their way into Gunray\'s command center, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan escape and flee to the surface of Naboo, where they meet local Gungan outcast Jar Jar Binks (Ahmed Best). As Jar Jar brings them to an underwater Gungan settlement, the Trade Federation captures Naboo\'s leader, Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman). Through a Jedi mind trick, Qui-Gon secures a submarine, which he, Obi-Wan, and Jar Jar use to reach the capital of Naboo and rescue Queen Amidala and her escort. The group departs for Coruscant, the Galactic Republic\'s capital planet, to seek help from the Senate.During the escape, the ship is attacked by the Federation blockade, forcing R2-D2, one of the ship\'s droids, to fix the shields. The attack damages the ship\'s hyperdrive, forcing the party to land on the desert planet of Tatooine for repairs. While searching for needed parts, Qui-Gon and a handmaiden named Padmé befriend young Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd), a nine-year-old human slave gifted in piloting and mechanics. Qui-Gon senses a strong presence of the Force in Anakin, and feels that he may be the ""Chosen One"" an individual the Jedi believe will fulfill a prophecy by bringing balance to the Force. At Anakin\'s insistence, Qui-Gon enters Anakin in the Boonta Eve Podrace in a bid with Anakin\'s master, Watto, to gain the needed parts and Anakin\'s freedom. Anakin eludes several obstacles including rival racer Sebulba to win the race, gaining his freedom and bankrupting Watto. After hesitation, Anakin leaves his mother and his droid, C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), behind on Tatooine to go with the Jedi. As the group prepares to depart, they are attacked by the Sith apprentice Darth Maul (Ray Park), who battles Qui-Gon until the heroes escape.On Coruscant, Qui-Gon informs the Jedi Council of the mysterious, well-trained attacker. The Council becomes concerned that this may indicate the reappearance of the Sith, an opposing order that followed the dark side of the Force and had long ago disappeared. Qui-Gon informs the Council about Anakin, hoping that he can be trained as a Jedi. After testing the boy the Council refuses, worried that he is too old for training and that the fear and anger that he harbors will cloud his future. Meanwhile, Senator Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) of Naboo persuades Amidala to call a vote of no confidence in Chancellor Valorum. The vote removes Valorum from power and leads to Palpatine\'s nomination for the position, which Amidala considers too late to be effective. To stop the Federation invasion by herself, the Queen decides to return to Naboo with her security team, the two Jedi, R2-D2, Anakin, and Jar Jar.On Naboo, Padmé reveals herself as Queen Amidala and forms an alliance with the Gungans for the battle against the Trade Federation. The Gungans march into battle to divert the Federation army away from the capital, allowing the others to infiltrate the palace. Once inside the palace hangar, the Jedi free several Naboo pilots, who regain their starfighters and assault the Federation droid ship. As they make their way to the throne room, the infiltration team is confronted by Darth Maul. Qui-Gon and Obi Wan engage Maul while the others take an alternate route. Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan duel with the Sith Lord amongst the catwalks of a massive power-generating reactor core. Obi-Wan is briefly delayed, separating him from Qui-Gon and Maul. Meanwhile, Queen Amidala and her forces fight their way into the palace and capture Nute Gunray, Viceroy of the Trade Federation. Anakin - who inadvertently joined the dogfight in space - destroys the droid-control ship\'s reactor with proton torpedoes, which deactivates the droid army in the midst of taking Gungan prisoners. In the reactor core, Qui-Gon re-engages Darth Maul singlehandedly, but is mortally wounded. Obi-Wan catches up with and defeats Maul in another intense lightsaber battle. With his final breath, Qui-Gon instructs Obi-Wan to train Anakin to become a Jedi.In the aftermath, the newly elected Supreme Chancellor Palpatine congratulates Queen Amidala on her victory and promises to watch Anakin\'s career with great interest. Meanwhile, the Jedi Council promotes Obi-Wan to the level of Jedi Knight, and Yoda reluctantly accepts Obi-Wan\'s request to train Anakin as his padawan. During Qui-Gon\'s funeral, Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson) and Yoda (Frank Oz) agree that the person who killed Qui-Gon must have been a Sith, but as the Sith are known to have only a master and an apprentice, they are unsure which was killed. A large celebration is held on Naboo to celebrate the world\'s liberation and the newborn alliance between the Naboo and the Gungans.']"
4,Star Wars,Attack of the Clones,121765,"['And now, the Darth Vader origin story really begins. In fact, ""Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones"" sort of renders its predecessor useless. ""Episode I"" feels like a mostly unnecessary part of the story now that ""Episode II"" gives a better glimpse into the troubled young man Anakin Skywalker – the future Darth Vader – has become. Of course, ""Attack of the Clones"" also has troubles of its own. Although it is quite the grandiose visual effects spectacle – more so than any of its predecessors – it is the smaller, character- driven parts of the story that George Lucas absolutely botches, to almost comical effect.Central to the entire prequel trilogy is the story of how Darth Vader becomes Darth Vader and the Galactic Empire rises to power, which means Lucas has a trajectory he must follow. It\'s clear in many ways that the story and screenplay is slave to this. Everything must add up to fit with the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy and Lucas must connect the dots, even if they don\'t all want to connect.The dots that are most critical to the story are the ones that trace Anakin Skywalker\'s (Hayden Christensen) path to the dark side and becoming the father of Luke and Leia. Therefore, he must turn evil – and fall in love – at the same time.Because ""The Phantom Menace"" does very little legwork for Anakin\'s turn to the dark side, everything falls on ""Attack of the Clones"" to put it in motion. Right away, we are presented with a cocky, reckless young padowan of Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) who is nothing like little ""Ani"" in ""Episode I."" He is also extremely forward with Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman), because, well, they have to fall in love and there just isn\'t much time for them to do so in a believable way.Before ripping into this unfortunate romantic subplot, it\'s worth noting that most else about ""Clones"" is entertaining. Running through the film is a pretty solid mystery thread: As a dangerous separatist movement gains steam in the Republic, now-Senator Amidala finds her life threatened and Obi-Wan and Anakin are assigned to protect her, and if possible, identify her would-be assassin. Obi- Wan traces a poison dart to a mysterious planet called Kamino, where he uncovers a big secret and a conspiracy unfolds.Ever since Alec Guinness\' Ben Kenobi mentioned fighting with Luke\'s father in the Clone Wars in ""A New Hope,"" ""Star Wars"" die-hards have been itching to see the Clone Wars and find out just what they were all about. ""Attack of the Clones"" sets this up an exciting way and introduces some exciting villains to boot in Jango Fett (Temuera Morrison) and Count Dooku (Christopher Lee). For the first time, fans can piece together how the Galactic Empire came into power, and that\'s exciting.Interspersed with this unraveling mystery, however, is the Anakin- Padme romance, a subplot that reveals the most hideous weaknesses of Lucas\' storytelling ability, namely that he cannot write good dialogue and he most certainly cannot create a genuine romance. The feistiness of the Leia-Han backward romance accidentally worked out really well for Lucas because of Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford\'s repartee. This romance, however, is way more dramatic, serious and creepy. For one, the age gap between the two is uncomfortable, and largely because Padme says that she still sees him as a little boy. For another, he comes on to her aggressively and with a stalker-like anger that she apparently doesn\'t mind after he\'s persistent enough. And amidst it all, Anakin is having nightmares about his mother and is dealing with feelings of revenge that don\'t seem to bother Padme. There\'s just no way it had to be this ugly, but again, Anakin is Luke and Leia\'s father, and that has to happen somehow.In a film without ""Star Wars"" in the title, ""Attack of the Clones"" would\'ve warranted more scathing backlash, but the romance failure is somehow more acceptable in this instance because ""Clones"" is part of a story and a universe bigger than itself. You just have to brush it off. At least, unlike ""Phantom Menace,"" the film feels more connected to that universe in other ways (and there\'s exceptionally less Jar Jar Binks in it). With an iconic lightsaber duel at the end to top it all off, ""Clones"" skates by on adventure even though it does make it clear that no matter what happens in ""Episode III,"" the prequels won\'t have the same heart and same lovable nature as the original films do.~Steven CCheck out Movie Muse Reviews for more', 'Much like its predecessor, Star Wars - Episode II: Attack of the Clones has gained a rather sour reputation on the internet. Fortunately, many of the popular complaints about this film are either highly exaggerated or downright wrong. Chapter two of the Star Wars Saga is an energized and highly enjoyable two hours at the movies.Attack of the Clones follows Anakin Skywalker ten years after his exploits in The Phantom Menace. An older Anakin, played surprisingly well by Hayden Christiansen, is now training under the watchful eye of Ewan McGregor\'s Obi-Wan Kenobi. Searching the Internet, you won\'t find many fans who praise Christiansen\'s performance, but I found him to be very effective in the young, arrogant hotshot role he\'d been given. McGregor does similarly well in the older brother, mentor role. I enjoyed Episode I a lot, but the story is much more focused this time, with major events happening for Anakin, and an actual political conflict engulfing the Republic. The two major story lines in the film are, one, the political underpinnings that eventually lead to the start of the infamous Clone Wars, and two, the personal story of Anakin Skywalker, including the romance between him and the former Queen, Padme Amidala. The first of these story lines is wildly interesting, following the two opposing forces of the Clone Wars, The Republic and their clone army, and the Seperatists and their droid battalion, as they prepare for an imminent war. After an assassination attempt on Senetor Amidala, Obi-Wan embarks on a detective mission to a track down the people behind the plot. The political espionage and behind-the-scenes dealings make for a fascinating and focused story. The other major storyline is not as focused, but still works as a chapter in Anakin Skywalker\'s overall story. Anakin and Padme\'s love story works as a throwback to the grand, old-fashioned film romances of the 1930s and 40s (think Gone With the Wind), but for contemporary audiences, the few extended scenes of corny ""love speech"" dialogue might be pretty drab. However, these aren\'t as distracting or offensive as some claim. In fact, a couple of them actually work well, such as the meadow picnic, where Padme and Anakin discuss the futility of politics in the beautiful fields of Naboo. The actors have chemistry, and both are likable, especially Natalie Portman as Padme. Yes the love story can be a bit forced, and sometimes drab, but it fits the feel of the saga. It is a grand, sweeping, throwback to Hollywood\'s golden age.If the love story might be hit or miss, it\'s the other facet of Anakin\'s character arc that Lucas gets absolutely right. Plagued by visions of his mother in pain, Anakin takes Padme to Tatooine where he tracks down his mother, only to see her die in his arms. His response is chilling and powerful. The scene between him and Padme in a garage after he brings his mom\'s body back is perfectly executed, unveiling a dark, angry side of Anakin, while simultaneously showing his frailty and confusion. It truly is one of the very best scenes in the saga.Even if you didn\'t find the story as interesting as I did, there is no question that Episode II is an audio/visual feast for the senses. Lucas and company introduce a stunning variety of sprawling landscapes, crazy creatures, fanciful vehicles, and formidable weapons. Once again, the sheer amount of imagination contained in this world is unbelievable. While Attack of the Clones does tend to favor CGI backgrounds and creatures too much, it still looks undeniably cool. The nighttime skyline of Coruscant, the rain-drenched clone facility on Kamino, the termite mound planet of Geonosis; They all, along with the creatures that inhabit them, feel real, and look great. On these beautiful planets, we are treated to tons of terrific Star Wars action. George Lucas once again revels in directing off-the-wall fun. This film is an adventure through and through. Set-pieces range from a one-on-one battle between bounty hunter Jango Fett and Obi- Wan on the rainy platforms of Kamino to a gladiator-like fight against intergalactic monsters. The last half hour of the film particularly impresses, with a massive battle between the two giant armies, dozens of Jedis, and a helping of fantastic war machines. The whole thing ends with an epic face-off that sees Yoda battle with mind and sword against Christopher Lee\'s devilishly evil Count Dooku, a memorable villain with an air of gravitas. He\'s a classic Hollywood archetype with a Star Wars spin; an elegant villain who just happens to have a lightsaber (with an awesome curved handle) and can shoot lightning from his hands.Needless to say, Attack of the Clones is much better than its reputation suggests. Complaints of poor story, too much politics, and ""fake"" looking CGI are almost completely unfounded, and the few moments of clichéd dialogue (the only complaint I can really understand) are such a small part of the film, that I barely notice them. However, for some reason that I honestly can\'t understand, it has become increasingly more ""uncool"" to like this film. Personally, I value energy and atmosphere in a blockbuster like this, and Episode II of the Star Wars Saga is packed with it. Attack of the Clones is a grand, sweeping, large-scale adventure. The story is mostly great, with only a few stretches that drag, and as with all the Star Wars movies (especially the prequels), the special effects and action are top notch. That is, after all, why you watch the Star Wars movies; to visit unknown worlds and have a ton of fun doing so. Star Wars - Episode II: Attack of the Clones isn\'t a world-class lesson in dialogue, but between the visual spectacle, first-rate action, and heavenly John Williams score, it is entertainment of the highest degree.86/100', ""Unfortunately, Attack Of The Clones could've been a great movie if it weren't for bad acting and poor screenplay. Many parts are great, but they are overshadowed by a love story that is cringeworthy and creepy."", ""First off the movie had some good aspects about it. For one the relationship between Obi-Wan and Anakin was phenomenal. They were emotional and comedic at the same time. The second thing is the action. This movie was very action packed and the choreography in the fights were very good. The conflict was nice as well I just wish they didn't have as many sub-plots. I didn't like how unnecessarily long this movie was, it felt like 3 hours. Some scenes didn't need to be included and I didn't like how they made it seem as if Anakin was obsessed over Padme but other than that their romance was believable and cute. The acting was strong although sometimes it came off as bland. The beginning tried to be serious but ended up looking like a joke. The movie was pretty good overall but could've done better."", ""This episode of the Star wars saga was criticized by some when it came out for having wooden dialogue and too much digital landscaping to be any good. I wasn't overly impressed with it myself, but having seen all 6 films now, AOTC is actually a very important and well done section of the overall series.Lucas has said time and again that this movies are meant to be seen as one long film, not to be taken as 6 individual movies. This particular installment features so much that affects every other episode. The discovery of the clones, the immaturity and arrogance of Annakin, the beginning of the clone wars. All of these events happen in this one movie, which is actually a lot more than what happens in some of the other films. I don't consider this to be the best of all 6 by any means, but it is certainly not nearly as bad as some people make it out to be."", ""It is now 2014 and I finally got to watch both Episode I and Episode II, during a weekend visit to some friends. Since the 3 prequels were released (I believe Episode III was in 2005) I have heard a lot of bad comments for the movies and Lucas specifically. That all he is after is money and franchising, bad director, bad writer and the like.When you expect less, you get more out of it. That is a rule of life. And perhaps this is the reason I enjoyed Episode II so much. Or, more precise, one of the reasons.The other reasons are that it fully immerses you into another world. This is imperative for a movie. I would go as far as saying that movies *are* immersion, above all other things. So this one, in my book, is a successful movie. You do get the feeling of watching a world similar to ours, but orders of magnitude bigger, were countries have been replaced by planets and nations by species. And they, too, have their problems. Politics, war, greed. The political and social references of the movie are not to be taken lightly. They were well thought out and make this movie enjoyable to watch by adults as well.Technically the movie looks fantastic, the plot feels realistic and the dialogs are good. The dialogs have seldom something smart in them, but they work. I would expect a little more humor and punchlines, but anyway, I suppose dialogs are not the strong part of the movie.I could go on for hours but its late. All I want to end up with is that the movie is immersive, has good plot, decent dialogs and does not stall much, at least much less than Episode I.The one thing I did not like and God I don't know how they allowed it to happen, is that Anakin simply can not act."", ""I know most Star Wars fans were thoroughly disappointed with episodes 1-3, but I found the back up of the Trilogy to be great. Sure they weren't exactly the Trilogy, but I don't think I'd love Star Wars as much had the prequels not been made. They provided background and depth to the Trilogy, and they enable the Old Republic Era the evolve. I definitely understand why Lucas made these movies and appreciate them for what they have done for the Star Wars Universe.Attack of the Clones is by far the best of the Prequels. I believe it to have the best action and intensity of all three of the Prequels. Of the Prequels, I believe it to have some of the best acting and story line. I would advise this movie to anyone."", ""I happen to be one of the folks who really has enjoyed these films in the prequel trilogy. I also can see why people would not like the films and I don't deny people the right to their opinion. What has been bothering me has been some of the reasons people are giving for hating these new films... they are childish, they have too many special-effects, the acting is bad, the writing is bad, Lucas has sold out and has lost his touch... it makes me wonder if people are actually remembering the original trilogy correctly. Don't get me wrong, I love the original trilogy, but they weren't exactly well-acted or well-written movies. We didn't love them because they were these great Shakespearian works of art; we loved them because we were little kids totally enraptured by this exciting fantastical world. It seems that those same kids that loved the films 20 years ago have grown up into stuffy old yuppies that have no idea how to have fun anymore. Our generation has grown up and it seems that we wanted Star Wars to grow up with us, to morph into some new R-rated grown up version to satisfy our more mature needs. Well, we didn't like the original trilogy because it was all grown up and serious. We liked it because it was silly and fun and awesome to look at. I am personally glad that George Lucas did not make the prequels into a new grown up version. I like the adventure and excitement and I challenge the one major complaint that says that they do not live up to the originals. Let's look at what people have complained about when comparing these to the original trilogy.-The new movies are too childish and geared towards kids: So, somehow we're supposed to believe that the droids, aliens, spaceships swamp monsters, and warriors with mystical powers from the original trilogy were of the more mature variety.-The new movies have too many special effects: We're forgetting that the original movies were also special effects laden. Lucas has always pushed the limits of technology, even inventing new technology all the way. He has not sold out or changed or just now relied on special effects, he has always concentrated on the effects. If he had digital technology 20 years ago, he would have done the same thing then that he has now. That's what he does; he makes up worlds that don't exist and then comes up with a way to put them on film.-The writing has been bad on the new films: Does anybody recall Lucas ever receiving a Pulitzer Prize?-The acting has been bad on the new films: Carrie Fisher??? Mark Hamill??? Harrison Ford??? We're not exactly talking about Academy Award winners here. Name me one of the original main actors who was actually a great actor (other than Sir Alec). Now, Harrison Ford has had a great career, but he's no Jack Nicholson. And where are Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill now?-Anakin is just a whiny little brat: Does anybody also remember how whiny Luke was in the first two movies? I mean, he did nothing but whine and complain until Jedi. And how many times did they say that Luke was just like his father? Should anybody then be surprised that Anakin was a whiny adolescent?I think my point here is that people from my generation have taken something they loved as a kid and put it up on a pedestal so high that they are confused as to why they liked it. They think the original movies were these serious Academy Award caliber pieces of art and that's why they liked them. In fact, we liked them because they were cool and had monsters and space battles and there were toys that we could play with and have fun. The new movies are of the same mold as the original, they are unchanged. WE have changed and we're having a hard time dealing with that fact. Some would argue that these movies are not true Star Wars movies. I say, they are exactly the same... that's why I love them. If I want a serious film, I'll go find somethings starring Daniel Day-Lewis. I like action and science fiction, so I'll stick to the childish, poorly acted stuff."", ""The truth is the first time I had watched the movie I wasn't impressed. After rewatches over the years I realised this movie gets so much hate that it didn't deserve. Especially if you compare it to the new movies (episodes 7, 8,9) it is far better in script, character development and battles. Anakin is awesome in this movie and makes you feel totally familiar with yourself the way he acts following your heart instead of cold rules."", 'The lead actors are terrible.What was this?? Only deserves two stars because the Disney so-called Star Wars is 1 star.A better title for this movie: Titanic In Space - The Picnic Episode.', ""Right this is my first review, so don't slam down on me to hard! anyway... I've read a lot of comments about petty-problems with this film, but couldn't help thing'what the hell!,' this is a fun movie.First, a plot summery, Padme Amidarla is mow a senator for Naboo who deeply believes in democracy, and i travelling to couresant to vote 'no' for a Republic army. After a failed assassination attempt, Obi and Anakin are assigned to protect her. Anakin takes her back to Naboo for safety, while Obi tries to find out who's trying to kill her. Next, the special effects are great, all of it looks real and the detail to attention in superb. The Clone war is amazing, explosions and shooting. And the digital characters don't look fake at all. The plot is good too,it all revolves around the beginning of the clone wars and thats all I'm going to say. The acting is on the whole good, McGreggor, Portman and Lee are all great. Jackson's good. Christen leaves a lot to be desired but i can forgive him just this once. Finally, ignore the haters, this movie's great!"", 'It seems as though there is no way to dispel negative atmosphere once it has been started. George Lucas\'s STAR WARS trilogy was well-loved by audiences (even though critics were split) but for some reason (and I can\'t figure it out), the first entry in the prequels, THE PHANTOM MENACE, earned a HUGE onslaught of critically divided posts just about everywhere in the world, from the press to the internet to fans in real life. While I do agree that the original trilogy is a tough act to follow, I wasn\'t as grossly let down by this movie as some were.The same thing has happened to the second of the STAR WARS prequels, ATTACK OF THE CLONES, released in 2002. Many predicted that this movie would satisfy those who disliked Episode I with a vengeance, but alas, such was not the case. Once again, critics damned the movie for one reason or another, and the heated debate on whether Lucas ""trashed the original trilogy"" or not is still going on. I find it very sad that Lucas would still receive unfair critical attack, even after making a much darker, somber, and ominous movie in ATTACK OF THE CLONES. I\'m guessing that such naysayers will continue to say nay to Lucas no matter what just like rabid fans of Anime would continue to slam-dunk dubs... even if a lot of them have recently proved to be excellent.This is not to say that ATTACK OF THE CLONES is a flawless film. It actually has its share of problems that THE PHANTOM MENACE didn\'t have. The dialogue, although nowhere nearly as bad as critics and some disgruntled fans say, lacks the spark of the original trilogy. My biggest gripe with the movie is that it moves at a leisurely pace, with lots of weak, unsatisfying sequences that last too long. Most of these scenes consist of a love subplot involving Anakin Skywalker and Amidala Padme. When not interacting with each other, Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman are fine in their respective roles. (Christensen\'s monologue about his slaughtering of not only Tusken Raiders but--horrors!--women and children is frightening.) But there is a sense of awkwardness when they contribute to scenes which involve schmaltzy lines and screen kisses. I\'m guessing that they both felt uncomfortable doing these scenes, hence why the chemistry between them isn\'t as interesting as, say, Han and Leia\'s from the original trilogy.Only when the movie is in action does ATTACK OF THE CLONES become worthwhile--there\'s a dizzying chase through Coruscant on floating cars, maneuvering through a dangerous asteroid field near a planet, and a half-hour long showdown that showcases a lot of amazing CG work. Actually, what also make Episode II worth watching are the fantastic set designs. Every location in the movie, from the metropolis skyscrapers of Coruscant to the water planet where prototypes of Stormtroopers are being constructed literally bursts with imagination and eye candy.Of the performers I liked Ewan McGregor (Obi-Wan) the best; his acting is still a little shaky at times, but here he seems more comfortable with the role. Christopher Lee makes a surprise appearance as the new villain, Count Dooku, and once again he delivers first-rate evil with this character. And it\'s great to see C-3PO and R2-D2 up to their usual banter again (although sometimes some gags occur when not necessary). Ultimately, however, the film belongs to Jedi Master Yoda, played to perfection by Frank Oz. His appearances in THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK and RETURN OF THE JEDI featured him as a rubber puppet (and a delightful creation), but in this movie he really comes alive, thanks to first-rate CG effects. His mouth is perfectly in sync with every word he says, and the final showdown between him and Dooku is an absolute highlight.While ATTACK OF THE CLONES is, in some ways, a lesser entry in the STAR WARS franchise, its assets outweigh its weaknesses; most of the questions I had from the first episode seem to be addressed a little bit in this chapter, and, frustratingly enough, provides more questions for Episode III. Flawless or not, this is still a STAR WARS movie, and for what it is, it\'s still worth a look.', ""*WARNING MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* If you remember, I was one of the few who did not hate The Phantom Menace, in fact, I gave it a positive rating. If you'd like to get a different opinion on the prequels, please be sure and check that review out as well, but now, let's talk about The Attack of The Clones. This movie has a few rough spots, Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman don't have very good chemistry together, despite both of them giving decent performances in the rest of the movie. No, Hayden Christensen isn't that bad, he's a bit wooden, but I think he plays a believable confused young man who has been isolated all his life. In fact, I think that most of the hate surrounding Christensen is less about how he plays his role, and more about what role he's playing. People don't want Vader to be a bitter and over- reacting teenager, but in the scenes where Christensen is able to show who he'll become, he's great. Besides, this is all about how Anakin becomes Vader, he can't start out as Vader in Episode II. The movie also gets heat for other stuff, too boring, too much CGI, etc. The CGI effects look great, it makes it look like a more advanced culture, by having surroundings that we can't yet physically create. Now, maybe a few practical effects wouldn't have been amiss, but I think the use of CGI is a relatively minor complaint, and one that doesn't really effect the over-all quality of the film. The plot may be slow at times, but don't forget, we have lots of action in here as well. A full scale battle at the end, a high speed chase through Courscant, a duel between Obi-Wan and Jango Fett, etc. Yes there are slow stretches, but there are also plenty of scenes that are really fun. I know Yoda fighting with a light-saber, you know, a Jedi's weapon, is supposed to be just like heresy or something, but I can't take that complaint seriously. How else would Yoda have fought? With a stick? It's not like he doesn't use the force or anything! But enough with the negatives, let's talk about why this movie is genuinely good. Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan is great! He brings the right level of sophistication and intelligence to the character, while still managing to seem like a less experienced version of the character in A New Hope. Jango Fett is a really good villain, he brings in great action and is just over all a really cool character. I already said I like Hayden Christensen, who I think accurately displays youth, and provides a relate-able character for everyone who's ever been a teenager ever. The action is top-notch as well. The speeder chase on Courscant is a great start to the movie; humor, good effects, and very fast-paced. The finale is very well done also, and it's a blast to see the first full scale battle in a Star Wars movie (the gungans don't count). The story, thought admittedly a bit muddled, is interesting enough (let's be honest, Star Wars isn't story based, it is driven by characters and action). I understand very few will agree with this review, but I wanted to give my own opinion on the Star Wars movies, so, I started reviewing them. I'll try to have my Revenge of the Sith review up soon!"", 'I am a huge fan of Star Wars. I am also not the best critic, so I don\'t usually give things low ratings unless they really were bad. But I don\'t believe that Attack of the Clones was that terrible. Allow me to explain.I loved the original series. I think those movies were great. The Characters were amazing! The movies were action-packed and dramatic, yet hilarious too, and the action and comic moments didn\'t interfere! The Models looked so real, if you told me when I first saw it when I was 6 that they were CGI, I would have believed you! Everyone did their best. Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Darth Vader, etc. They were all so great!Now the new series is not nearly as good as the old series, but I believe that the prequel trilogy is SERIOUSLY underrated. They aren\'t as good as the old movies, but they are still amazing movies! It shows a new side of things. It brings something new to the plate. It shows how Anakin was able to turn from an innocent boy to the menacing Darth Vader. It showed how Palpatine set up the trap that destroyed the Republic and created the Empire. It dug deeper into what it meant to be a Jedi, and how we can be easily led astray if we let our guard down. It gives us 2 paths. The Path of Luke, and the Path of Anakin.Now that I have done some explaining, it\'s time to do what I wrote this review for. To review Attack of the Clones. I do agree it did have many flaws. I do agree that there was a lot of CGI in this movie. However, I do not think it was just to advertise its special effects. If you want a movie that does just that, go see ""2012"" or ""At World\'s End."" This was one of the weaker movies, but it was still amazing.If you look closely, you see a lot of parallelism in the trilogies. ""Phantom Menace"" and ""A New Hope"" both introduced to us the characters. A major character has a major loss (Obi- Wan/Luke). The main character destroys the ship that is causing all the trouble (Anakin/Luke). The main character comes from humble origins (Anakin/Luke). The same thing happened in ""Revenge of the Sith"" and ""Return of the Jedi"" (my 2 favorites of the series). Except there are some opposites. Anakin and Luke choose different paths. But they each fight someone close to them (Obi-Wan the mentor/Darth Vader the father). Palpatine has set his plan in order. But the results are different (Destruction of the Republic/Destruction of the Empire). In one we see great sadness (Padme\'s funeral and Creation of Darth Vader) and in the other we see great joy (Celebrations throughout the galaxy). We also see parallelism in ""Attack of the Clones"" and ""Empire Strikes Back."" We see the characters evolve from what they were in the first movie into what they will be in the third.In ""Attack of the Clones,"" we see many things. We see how Anakin struggles with the loss of his mother (Luke struggled for his friends who were in danger). We see how Palpatine sets up the plan that will slowly destroy the Republic. We see what started the Clone Wars, which Palpatine used to his advantage. We see the Jedi Order starting to crumble. It wasn\'t the best Star Wars, but it was still Star Wars.People criticize its flaws. They say that Anakin acts like a selfish brat. That is exactly what a young Darth Vader would be like! Anakin\'s anger got the best of him, and consumed him. We see that he has always struggled between good and evil (just as Luke did, on the Second Death Star). They say that there was too many special effects. I feel like the special effects didn\'t detract from the story. It\'s not like they animated all those battle scenes for no reason. They needed to show the intensity of the fight. The plot was a little confusing at first, and I feel it could\'ve been better, but it was still better than other major series installments (such as Kingdom of the Crystal Skull).All in all, it wasn\'t as strong as the other Star Wars movies, but it was still Star Wars, and I thought it was amazing! 9/10, because it had some flaws.', ""This used to be the worst Star Wars film until the new Disney 'Star Wars' came along. LMAO at the picnic scene where the hormonal teenager expresses his horniness to the so-called Senator/Queen/useless character."", 'I\'m going back and watching all six Star Wars films so I can go see ""The Force Awakens"", and last night I watched ""Episode II: Attack of the Clones"".I have to say that I find this to be a really enjoyable movie. I tried not to like it when it first came out due to its name. Seriously, George Lucas...""Attack of the Clones""? I mean, I get it, but there were lots of options for a better name than that. ""The Clone Army"" would have sufficed. But I digress...Again, I really like this movie. It suffers from a bit of poor dialogue and bad acting between Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen--their on screen romance feels very much like a bad daytime soap opera rather than something worthy of the Star Wars franchise.And yet, that bit of dissatisfaction aside, I find this to be a fantastic film overall. The storyline is great. The opening chase scene is great. Obi-Wan\'s search for the missing planet is great. The final battle is great. Most all of it is great.And, one thing that I greatly appreciate about this film is Christopher Lee\'s performance as Count Dooku. Funny name aside, Lee turns out a convincing portrayal of a lead antagonist that makes you understand what the Dark Side is all about. I found Darth Maul to be rather lacking as a villain in ""Phantom Menace"", but Lee makes up for this in profound fashion.But I suppose the most important thing that I enjoy about this movie is that it just brings so many pieces of the puzzle together. Anakin\'s story advances in a way that is plausible and believable, even if Christensen\'s portrayal suffers at times. This movie sets up his path to the Dark Side in profound fashion, and makes the six films flow together. I like that sense of continuity, and so I\'m giving this movie 8/10 stars. Again, the cheesy soap opera stuff between Anakin and Amidala is a major blow to the film--but all in all it\'s a great movie.Side Note: If I wanted to, I could get really critical about one element of the overall plot here. This whole Dark Side thing and the people involved in the plot to take over the Republic goes completely unnoticed by Yoda and Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson). That really cheapens the whole Jedi thing, in my view--the most powerful Jedi in the world are right in the midst of the people who are orchestrating the fall of the Republic, and they can\'t even sense it. Strange. Same goes for the fact that Dooku\'s back story is so wrapped up in the Jedi. How could they never sense this disturbance in the force in a way that would root it out?Whatever the case, that does bother me when I think critically about the film. But I try not to do that, but to instead watch it at face value and enjoy it for what it is, and on that merit I give it the 8/10 stars.', ""I love this film and Attack of the Clones is ranked 20th on my list of the best films for me and I also rank it 2nd on my list of the best Star Wars movie for me. I grew up with the Prequels so I'm very much part of the Prequel generation of Star Wars fans. I was 5 years old when Attack of the Clones was released so I may be slightly biased. Moving on as to why I think Attack of the Clones is such a great film, well the obvious really is the CGI, I love the CGI in this movie. The CGI in this film is commonly criticised by I think the worlds in this film such as Coruscant and Naboo were so beautiful to look at. To see those futuristic flying ships flying about on Coruscant makes it look so futuristic. Naboo looks so beautiful, I love the look of the rooms and buildings in the entire Prequel trilogy, many of those rooms and buildings wouldn't of looked so great without the CGI.I feel Attack of the Clones shows what life is like on Coruscant the most out of all the Star Wars movies, showing ordinary people just going about their lives on the futuristic capital planet of the Republic. Watching the Coruscant scenes felt like it was Earth In the year 2200 or something like that so it just felt incredible and fascinating to imagine the possibilities of all that kind of future technology. The CGI doesn't really look like it's aged at all, none of it looks fake. The CGI still looks very real to me and that's the main thing really, the CGI may not look so real to some people but the main thing is I still feel the CGI looks realistic in the old Prequel movies so therefore as long it doesn't look fake to the point it distracts you from being immersed in the film then there's really no problem with it.The Dexter's Diner and the Outlander Club buildings looked particularly great in Attack of the Clones and both hold a special place in my heart. Dexter's Diner will always be a great place to look at for me especially as it was the hub for the first Lego Star Wars game and I just love the look of the futuristic dining furniture, the weird alien cuisine, the eccentric robot waitress and a feeling of Dexter basing the diner off a 1950's American diner from Earth like as if they have knowledge of the Earth from thousands or hundreds of years ago. The thought of going to the diner to be greeted by the friendly alien Dexter and be well accommodated by great interesting cuisine, great ambience and affordable prices for the food whilst at the same time getting wise knowledgeable advice from the smart alien known as Dexter Jettster has always made me really want to go to that diner or at least a diner be made like it in real life as a replica. The bright lights, music and gambling activities at the Outlander Club also fascinated me and I imagine that would probably be the best place to get drunk if it existed, especially with their bright exotically coloured Star Wars alcoholic beverages served at the club. The extreme psychedelic and euphoric effects Death Sticks offer would give people would also be a great thing to have and really makes one want to be part of the amazing heart thumping adrenaline rushing, Female Jedi buttock pounding Star Wars universe, so yes death sticks was an interesting and very euphoric aspect of this movie which is great imagining about, just a shame they aren't very safe and highly addicting.The character line up in this movie was amazing, having great characters such as Anakin, Obi-Wan, Mace Windu and they even added some characters to this film which weren't in the Phantom Menace such as Dooku. I also thought Dooku was a better character than Darth Maul, more interesting than Darth Maul so that's one of the reasons why I prefer Attack of the Clones not just because it features more beautiful worlds but also because Dooku is a more complex character, not so black and white in my opinion as in my view Dooku was never a true Sith Lord. I believe Dooku actually only pretended to be a Sith Lord to try and stop Palpatine. Dooku never had yellow eyes like Sith Lords, never really used Dark Side powers except in duels and he was an old Jedi Master before 32 BBY.A lot of people criticise it but I really enjoy Anakin and Padme's romance in this film. A lot of people say their romance was too fast and they fell in love too quickly, but I like that aspect of it because it's more romantic and gives you a lot of hope as falling in love quickly is one of those amazing fantasies of a lot of people. Some people can fall in love very quickly in real life, it's not like it can't happen in real life though it isn't common. One of the reasons they fell in love so quickly may have been something to do with the Chosen One prophecy which would give them more reason to fall in love fast. I think Anakin's mother's death also sped up their romance for realistic reasons, Anakin's mother's death was another really great scene in this film. Padme was there for Anakin when he needed her and in a way because Padme could see how much Anakin cared about his mother, it proved to Padme just how good a person Anakin is. I don't see any real problems in Attack of the Clones, of course there is the hated line where Anakin talks about sand which gets a lot of criticism but I've always thought that line made perfect sense because Anakin came from a desert planet and he hated Tatooine, had a terrible childhood on Tatooine, sandstorms occur commonly on Tatooine so that also would've made life unpleasant for Anakin on Tatooine, it was also very hot in Tatooine so that probably would've given him sunburn at times and Tatooine is sandy so it makes sense as sand would remind him of Tatooine, a place which would've brought back terrible memories for Anakin. So to me that line made sense and I think the line is great.I really liked Hayden's portrayal of Anakin in Attack of the Clones. I like the progression of his character because in Episode II Anakin was a bit like Luke was in A New Hope where he was a whiny spoilt teenage farm boy and in Episode II Anakin was similar being whiny, spoilt and very arrogant Padawan Learner. So it really drew a good parallel between father and son so I did like that aspect and shows how similar Luke and Anakin and showcases that special father and son bond. Teenagers are after all more prone to tantrums so I thought that was realistic. I felt Anakin's anger was portrayed brilliantly, especially during the scene where he reveals to Padme he killed the Tusken Raiders, I thought that was perfectly delivered and very realistic. You could really see the anger when he said that and he was obviously trying to bottle up his anger to try not to show Padme, be less awkward and be more Jedi like but when he finally released his anger when he tells her the truth, it just made it so much more emotional, satisfying and realistic. I also think Attack of the Clones had the best duels in a Star Wars movie until Revenge of the Sith. The Clone Wars and the big battle was fantastic and was a good way to show how powerful the Jedi Order was as well as the likes of Obi-Wan and Anakin, especially as there were 200 Jedi that took part in the battle and only Anakin, Obi-Wan, Mace, Shaak Ti and a few other Jedi Masters survived so it really shows the correlation between the average Jedi, skilled Jedi and Jedi Council members so overall Attack of the Clones is a great film, great settings, great action scenes, a really complex plot, much more complex plot than the Original Trilogy movies and had a brilliant character line up."", 'Another amazing episode to the star wars franchise even the genosis colosseum battle was so epic this is a must watch', 'I personally love this movie, a lot. Most significantly: It gives us a deep, painful, believable look at the birth of Darth Vader inside Anakin. I don\'t care what anyone says, Anakin saying he killed ""not just the men"" always will be a genuinely amazing and heart wrenching performance by Hayden Christiansen. Every other aspect of the movie, I also love: The war on Geonosis is incredible, as are the lightsaber duels with Dooku. Following Obi Wan through his adventure to Kamino was a load of fun and laid the ground work for the republic\'s army perfectly. The list goes on and on!!! Yes, Anakin was a little bit creepy, and yes a lot of the CGI hasn\'t aged well. Aside from those two small setbacks, this is an awesome movie that progresses a lot of aspects of the Star Wars story, and most importantly, lays the groundwork of the fall of Anakin Skywalker and rise of Darth Vader.', ""Before seeing Attack of the clones I had seen neither the original star wars nor episode I and I didn't have any particularly strong ambitions to see them, I am a big cult fan but star wars just never really appealed to me.I happened to come across the episode II DVD going cheap while browsing in my local library and thought I might as well buy it. And to my slight amazement, I really loved it. Many fans complain that the new ones are nothing compared with the originals, having never seen the originals to compare it with I thought it was brilliant. The action, the adventure, the love story, the lightsabres, C-3PO. The chase through the city near the beginning was fast and furious and had great special effects, as did the scene when Obi-Wan first sees the clones. The arena scene is a particular favourite of mine as it flows so well passing from one piece of action to another with such ease. The fights were amazing (particularly Obi-Wan's and Jango's) and very well choreographed. The film made me laugh (which is something I almost always look for) just little lines like 'I retransmitted it to Coruscant, just as you'd requested, Master. Then we decided to come and rescue you.' [Obi-Wan looks at his handcuffed hands] 'Good job'. The whole thoroughness of it all just made me wonder about the sheer immensity of George Lucas's imagination and it made me realize why all those boys in my class used to make lightsabre noises. I admit that some of the Anakin/Padme dialogue was sickly sweet but being a typical teenage girl when it comes to love, I'm fine with that. Also overall the acting was slightly wooden but I admit that this did suit the Jedi style characters. Overall, it was my ideal film, action, adventure, romance, comedy and some nice epic not too drawn out battles. If this is bad compared to the originals, then I really should get round to seeing those originals.9/10"", 'Last night I watched SW2 for the first time and I surprised and happy at how well this movie was directed and scripted. There are tiny bits of scenes that could have been re-filmed, but I felt these nuances were minor, in fact these small issues in the film kept the same feeling as the original film, SW4; A New Hope. The musical score was awesome and the ending score of the movie was very well written. I am going to watch this movie again soon but tonight, I am watching SW3 and then back to 5 and 6. I am doing this to prepare myself for the upcoming SW7. I felt SW2 really put all the pieces together for the entire series and explained the forthcoming movies very well. It helped me understand the big picture of the overall storyline.', ""First off, don't blame the actors or the special effects. It's not their fault. Whenever someone knocks a bad movie, which Episode II qualifies as, they immediately raise the pitchforks towards the actors. If your going to lay some blame, lay it at the feet of George Lucas. It was his puerile script that brought the actors to their knees, and his lack of direction that made them stay there. It was George's unholy fascination with all things digital that massacred the screen with billions of wasted pixilated images, making the flesh and blood actors seem like they stepped into the Twilight Zone.This movie serves one purpose and one purpose only...to manually pleasure George Lucas' fanbase. The only things that seperate this wheelbarrow full of fertilizer from the average sci-fi schlock are the overinflated budget for Lucas' digital toys and the useless insertion of previous Star Wars characters.(SPOILERS ABOUND BELOW)The movie flows like a frozen sewage runoff. It goes from high speed, high altitude car chases, to boring, forced angst by the fireplace. To say that Christensen and Portman have no chemistry is to say that the Middle East might be facing some political problems. Their romance is about as believable as grass growing on the moon. Maybe they could have done better if the script hadn't been written with crayons.I thought these prequels were about Anakin's spiral downward from the path of balance into the Darkside. Is that ever going to happen or are we going to be forced to watch a third episode of video game previews for the Game Cube? We were given a lackluster hint with the slaughter of the Sand People but that barely cuts it. It wasn't even shown, thereby castrating the power of the scene. We just have to hear Anakin whine about it for about three seconds. Usually, when someone butchers a whole village of men, women, and children there's a whole lot more soul searching going on afterward. Of course, Lucas goes the pansy route and glosses over the whole thing. Most people I've talked to didn't even remember the scene until it was brought up to them.I'm probably one of the few people completely disgusted witht the Yoda fight at the end with the unimpressive Darth Sarumon (Lee plays the exact same character in LOTR: former wizard turned evil lackey=former jedi turned evil lackey). It's almost as if instead of a hand being up Yoda's posterior they've inserted a heroin suppository. Lucas has, in a brief half-minute, meaningless fight scene, destroyed the mystery of Yoda. The entire fight was unwarranted. If Yoda can raise ships from swamps and hold big chunks of pillar in the air, why can't he just pick up Count Poopoo and bang him against the wall a few times, soften him up a little, so to speak. Why? Because Lucas has toys he must abuse, that's why.The real star of this movie is the CGI. And CGI doesn't make good film. CGI is a support for a movie, that's it.There were far too many real world references, as well. Death sticks=cigarettes. Lame. Fifties diner in a galaxy far, far away, complete with sassy robo-waitress. Lame. This is supposed to be far removed from our world in the aforementioned galaxy far away. All I missed was the Fonz. Where the Hell was he? It might have been an improvement.In closing..Lucas needs to stop writing, directing and editing. Let a grown up handle these things. All that crap about these movies being for kids is a lark. These movies are for the nerds of the late seventies and early eighties who can't seem to move on in the world. The charm of Star Wars was gone before Lucas unveiled his uber-deluxe, special treatment of the films for the third time. And now he's doing it again. Maybe he'll go the Spielburg route and replace all the blasters with peace symbols. Rating 1 out of 10. I'd rate it lower, but I was never good with fractions."", ""George Lucas has finally done it. He has made a movie for the fans. This ranks as high as my favorite Empire Strikes Back in someways better. I love the themes, the music the plot. A very eree parallel to the same series of events and similar circumstances Luke went through however Anakin is having it a lot worse than Luke did in my opinion. This new kid Hayden Christensen was perfect for Anakin. He played a very convincing person I could forsee becoming Darth Vader. He better be in Episode 3. And Natalie Portman, she gets more and more beautiful in every movie. Ewan McGregor is the best Obi Wan Kenobi. I hope that the actor playing Jango returns as Boba Fett (with some growth acceleration) for Episode 3. This movie was such an excellent parallel to Empire Strikes Back. Episode 1 paralleled A New Hope, kind of their own establishing movies that weren't that in depth. You know they are going to parallel Episode 3 with Return of the Jedi, I forsee Anakin fighting and slaying Dooku taking his place at Palpatine's side.Nice Job George! This film was fantastic. I hope he keeps the momentum and story ties in Episode 3, they have alot of story to cover. A+"", ""If you listen to some fans of the original Star Wars trilogy, the new one is crap. This is, I've found out, true only with the Phantom Menace, which was very poorly directed and edited piece of film.Attack of the Clones in the other hand is in comparison a superior achievement from PM. But it does contain couple of unnecessary segments, which drag the speed of the film down. And some of the acting is, even in the standard of the Star Wars, pretty horrible. But happily all those under achievers are not in any important roles and seasoned actors like Christopher Lee (Count Dooku) do deliver what you expect of them. others deserving nomination here are Samuel L. Jackson as Mace Windu and Ian McDiarmid as Palpatine.So, the plot. Obi Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), and Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) are told to watch over senator Padame (Natalie Portman) because of assassination attempts towards her life. This soon leads in Obi in discovery of secretly manufactured clone army. Who is behind all this? Will Padame and Anakin fall in love? When does Anakin fall in to the dark side? Will he become a Jedi before all this? Some of these questions are partly answered in AOTC, but some are left waiting for the third installment of the new trilogy.But as said, this is much better film than Phantom Menace. It's not best film in the Star Wars saga, but in my opinion it does deliver. It's mostly fun to watch, action sequences are good, special effects are even better and despise some bad acting and some pretty horrible dialogs, it wasn't pain in the back side to watch.So, my advise: don't listen to roaring Star Wars fans who claim this movie to be one of the worst things ever and don't listen to those, who claim this one to be best thing since sliced bread.Attack of the Clones is above average, but not the greatest thing ever either."", 'The second episode of the new trilogy of ""Star Wars"" was much better than the first. He is much more gloomy, eventful and full of the sense that soon the customary world will collapse ... Moreover, it can be considered the most romantic film of the saga - speech, of course, about the love line of Anakin Skywalker and Padme Amidala performed by Natalie Portman. It is not only very well developed, but it also takes place mainly in very beautiful, blooming locations, which is generally uncommon for Star Wars. Even sad to realize that it is waiting for a tragic ending ...In all other respects, the ""Clone Attack"" can be considered a good film. Excellent battles on light swords, skirmishes, long conversations and flights on space ships - all this is done very qualitatively and interestingly. There are a lot of really unexpected plot twists, which will be appreciated not only by the fans of the universe, but by all the rest. For example, when a small dwarf Yoda takes a lightsaber in his hands and almost starts on an equal footing with the formidable Count Dooku, perhaps everyone was surprised ...However, in spite of this, the second episode can not be put on the same level as the classical trilogy. And it\'s not even the quality of performance, but the fact that those films evoked much more emotional response, they had the notorious ""Star Wars magic"", which is practically absent in the first two prequels.However, watching the ""Attack of the Clones"" is worth all fans of fiction - these films are shot too rarely.', 'The opening crawl reveals that the Galactic Republic is in crisis. A separatist movement, led by former Jedi Master Count Dooku (Christopher Lee), has threatened the peace. Senator Padmé Amidala (Natalie Portman), former Queen of Naboo, returns to the Galactic Senate to vote against the creation of an Army of the Republic. Upon her arrival at Coruscant, she narrowly escapes an assassination attempt, a bomb placed on her ship. As a result, Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) requests that she be put under the protection of Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and his apprentice, Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen).That night, a bounty hunter named Zam Wesell makes another attempt on Padmé\'s life. She is then pursued by Anakin and Obi-wan, but is killed by a toxic dart from an armored assailant who flies away.Following the attack on the Senator\'s Jedi Council assign Anakin the takes of escorting Padme back to Naboo for her own protection, while Obi-wan is assigned to find out more about the murder attempt. Though Padme objects to the request to go into hiding, she accepts at the request of the Supreme Chancellor. With her away, she assigns Jar Jar Binks (Ahmed Best) to represent her place in the Senate.Obi-wan\'s investigation takes him to a friend named Dexter Jettster, who identifies the item that killed Zam as a Kamino Saber-Dart. Going to the Jedi Archive to find out information on Kamino, Obi-Wan is surprised when the planet does not show up in his search. Bringing this to Master Yoda\'s attention, it is surmised that someone erased the location from the archive memory banks.Obi-Wan goes to the presumed location, and does find the planet, where he discovers that a secret clone army is being developed for the Republic. The Kaminoan Prime Minister tells him that this army was ordered some ten years ago by a Jedi Master named Sifo-Dyas, whom the Jedi Council believes to have been killed around the same time. A bounty hunter named Jango Fett (Temuera Morrison) had been hired to be the template for the clones. Obi-Wan meets Jango on Kamino, and believes that he is the killer he has been tracking. After unsuccessfully trying to capture Jango Fett, Obi-Wan places a tracking device on his ship and follows him to the planet of Geonosis.Meanwhile, Anakin and Padmé spend time together on Naboo, and Anakin reveals his love for her. Padmé resists, explaining that it would be impossible for the two of them to be together; she is a respected Senator, and the Jedi Code forbids marriage or any other form of attachment. Anakin is soon troubled by dreams in which his mother, Shmi (Pernilla August), is in danger and dying. He asks Padmé to accompany him to Tatooine. Upon arriving, Anakin learns that his mother was sold by his former master to a moisture farmer who lives outside of Mos Esley. Anakin and Padame arrive at the Lars farm where he meets his stepbrother Owen and his fiancee Beru as well as his stepfather Kleg Lars, who married Shmi. Anakin learns that his mother had been kidnapped one month earlier by local Tusken Raiders. Anakin tracks her to a Tusken camp, where he finds her in poor condition, and within moments she dies in his arms. In a fit of rage, he slaughters the entire Tusken community. Anakin brings his mother\'s body back to her home, where her funeral is held.On Geonosis, Obi-Wan learns that Count Dooku and Trade Federation Vicreoy Nute Gunray have built a new droid army and that Gunray has ordered the assassination of Padmé. Just before being captured, Obi-Wan relays this information to Anakin so that he can relay it to the Jedi Council on Coruscant. Once the Jedi learn of Dooku\'s army, Jedi Master Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson) leads a team to Geonosis. Meanwhile, Jar Jar Binks calls for Chancellor Palpatine to be given emergency powers, with which he can call the recently discovered clone army into battle.Back on Geonosis, the manipulative Count Dooku tries to persuade Obi-Wan to join him, warning him that the Senate is secretly under the control of a mysterious Sith Lord by the name of Darth Sidious. Obi-Wan refuses to believe him, saying that the Jedi would have known if that were the case. Upon learning that Obi-Wan is in trouble, Anakin and Padmé go to Geonosis, but they are captured during their infiltration of a droid factory, despite Anakin\'s valiant efforts.They join Obi-Wan in an arena-like complex where three huge creatures are unleashed on them for their execution. During their struggle, Mace Windu arrives with the Jedi, and they battle the droid army. Just as defeat for the Jedi seems imminent, Yoda arrives with the Republic\'s new clone army.The Battle of Geonosis. A large battle erupts between the Republic\'s clone forces and the Separatists\' droid army. Count Dooku attempts to escape, but Obi-Wan and Anakin track him to a secret hangar, where they engage him in combat. Dooku quickly injures Obi-Wan and cuts off Anakin\'s right arm. Yoda arrives and engages Dooku in light saber combat. Dooku, realizing he may be outmatched, causes a support pylon to nearly fall on Anakin and Obi-Wan; Yoda uses the Force to stop this, allowing Dooku to escape with the plans for a new weapon, the Death Star. In a desolate industrial district on Coruscant, he meets with his master, Darth Sidious, who is pleased that the war has begun ""as planned"". Dooku is revealed to be the apprentice Sith Lord, Darth Tyranus.On Coruscant, Obi-Wan informs the Jedi Council of Dooku\'s warning that Darth Sidious is controlling the Senate. All of them, including Yoda, are surprisingly hesitant to believe this, stating that the Dark Side is capable of creating fear and mistrust. Yoda and Windu also agree that the Dark Side is now clouding everything, and that they should closely monitor the Senate.Meanwhile, Palpatine oversees the launching of a massive clone trooper force. The great and terrible Clone Wars have begin.In the final scene set on Naboo, Anakin (with a new mechanical hand) and Padmé hold a secret wedding, to which only the droids C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) and R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) are witnesses.']"
5,Star Wars,Revenge of the Sith,121766,"['The final entry in George Lucas\' Star Wars saga, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith is one, giant climax to arguably the most popular movie franchise in history. It\'s also the most riveting of the series; A movie of such visual and storytelling intensity that it makes our typical standards for summer entertainment seem trivial. Sith has wall-to-wall action and jaw-dropping special effects, yes. By all measures, Episode III is a grand success when it comes to giving the legions of Star Wars fans any and everything they could have hoped for after Darth Vader uttered the words ""We meet again"" in 1977. The beauty of Revenge of the Sith is that it earns much more than diverting summer thrills. Strip away all the baggage that comes with the name \'Star Wars\' and what you are left with is one of the most enthralling films of 2005.Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith serves as a bridge to the first Star Wars, A New Hope, where we see the culmination of Anakin Skywalker\'s fall to the Dark Side. This is where Darth Vader is born. In addition to finally delivering on the promise of the entire prequel trilogy, Revenge of the Sith also has the gargantuan task of telling the story of how the Clone Wars ended, how an evil Empire emerged from a democratic Republic, and how Luke, Leia, Obi-Wan, and the rest found themselves where they are at the start of the original Star Wars movie. With all these massive story lines, it\'s a wonder that Lucas manages to squeeze the best out of every plot line, without straying from the film\'s most important element, Anakin\'s seduction by Chancellor/Emperor Palpatine. After having a vision of his wife, Padme, dying in childbirth, Jedi prodigy Anakin Skywalker consults with the chancellor, who expertly influences the young Jedi into turning to the dark side of the force. The entire seduction works brilliantly. With the seeds of Anakin\'s tragic flaw planted way back in The Phantom Menace, and expanded upon in Attack of the Clones, Revenge of the Sith is free to focus on the straw that broke the camel\'s back. Anakin\'s desperation to save Padme\'s life makes his eventual turn believable, and Ian McDiarmid and Hayden Christensen both do well portraying an icy relationship that turns into a destructive mentorship. Anakin\'s final fall, framed alongside the rise of the Empire is a storytelling masterclass. Palpatine\'s seduction is subtle, yet dramatic, and the numerous loose ends from the originals are all tied with a certain kind of poetry. For all his writing deficiencies, Lucas spins this fable elegantly, with a delicacy that makes you realize, he\'s been dreaming of telling this story for a long, long time. The plot marches relentlessly forward with commanding momentum, but it is only one side of Revenge of the Sith. The special effects and action are in a class of their own. Episode III is the biggest of all the Star Wars movies in terms of story, and the visual effects return the favor. Once again, Lucas and company revel in all kinds of wide, sweeping shots of new worlds such as the lava fields of Mustafar or the city-sized sinkholes of Utapau. It\'s all part of a grand, dramatic style of filmmaking that makes Revenge of the Sith look like a finale, through and through. It\'s also remarkable how certain elements like the ships, soldiers, and costumes seamlessly blend into what is seen in the originals. As sophisticated as the effects are, its George Lucas and his painterly talent for composition that propel the effects from technically well done exercises of CGI and miniatures to truly beautiful cinematic images. Lost in all this is the action. The film begins with an old-fashioned space battle on an epic scale. It\'s a feast for the eyes, and it feels distinctly like classic Star Wars. The lightsaber duels, the lizard versus mono-wheel chase scene (which includes the villain General Grievous; a half droid, half alien, wheezing wonder of imagination and digital wizardry), and the Clone War battles are dazzling on levels rarely seen in traditional summer blockbusters. The final duel between Obi-Wan and a newly christened Darth Vader is operatic and straight-up Shakespearian in its emotional complexity. Along with the Order 66 montage, the action of the last half of Revenge of the Sith is as powerful as anything in the series.As with any movie, there are things in Episode III that could be criticized. The dialogue isn\'t dramatically better than it was in the previous two movies, and the acting can be wonky at times, but none of this amounts to anything in the grand scheme of things. In the end, Sith does so much right that complaining about a line or two that was corny or delivered awkwardly is an utter waste of time. The finale to the Star Wars saga aims so high and nails so many key notes, that its minor flaws are almost completely inconsequential. Revenge of the Sith is one of the boldest works of blockbuster filmmaking ever made. I can\'t name another tentpole franchise movie that comes close to the level of operatic emotional poignancy that marks the best moments of Episode III of the Star Wars Saga. Movies like this don\'t come around often. A New Hope is still the Star Wars movie we will cherish most, but in its boundless ambition and breathtaking power, Revenge of the Sith is high art in the form of a summer blockbuster. George Lucas puts every idea he\'s had about good vs evil, fathers and sons, and the rise and fall of empires into this masterpiece of popular entertainment. Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith is a brilliantly crafted epic, one that cements George Lucas\' Star Wars Saga as one of the great achievements in filmmaking history.92/100', 'In Coruscant, the Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) rescue the Supreme Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) from the Separatist General Grievous\' spaceship and Anakin kills Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) with his light-saber after a fight; however Grievous escape from the Jedi. When they land on Coruscant, Padmé Amidala (Natalie Portman) comes to tell Anakin that she is pregnant. Soon he has premonitions of his wife dying during the delivery. Palpatine requests that Anakin joins the Jedi Council against the will of the members but his is not promoted to Master and stays Padawan; further they ask him to spy Palpaline. Anakin is manipulated by Palpatine about the true intentions of the Jedi and is tempted to know the dark side of the Force that could be capable to save Padmé. Further Palpatine discloses that he is Sith Lord Darth Sidious. What will Anakin do?""Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith"" is the final part of the saga initiated in 1977 by George Lucas. This episode is among the best ones and shows how Darth Vader was born. George Lucas in 1971, surprised the world with the cult ""THX-1138"". In 1973, another great movie: ""American Graffiti"". Then, in 1977, he directed the fantastic ""Star Wars"". Since this date, he basically dedicated his life only to the excellent Star Wars saga. With his potential, he could have contributed much more to the cinema industry. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Star Wars: Episódio III - A Vingança dos Sith"" (""Star Wars: Episode III – The Revenge of the Sith"")Note: Last time I saw this film was on 19 November 2005.', ""The first two movies in the prequel trilogy weren't horrible, but had so many flaws. This one isn't as good as any movie in the original trilogy, but if you ask me it's pretty close. This one is actually very well done and special effects don't look so fake now and give us some really epic scenes, especially in a movie's climax that will keep you at the edge of your seat. Here, George Lucas proved that he can still do it and I was really satisfied with this movie. The acting was the best the prequel trilogy gave and Hayden Christensen isn't so wooden and annoying anymore. Here he's actually pretty cool and shows that he has potential, but Ewan McGregor remains the best part of the cast. You really believe him to be young Obi-Wan and that's very well done and he also has some very heartbreaking moments with Anakin at the end. One of the biggest flaws in the prequels was all those political conversations. Just lots and lots and lots of talking that makes you want to fall asleep, but thankfully, Lucas listened to his fans and it's reduced here. It's still present, of course, but not as much. Romance between Padme and Anakin is a little bit more believable here, but still not enough and that's one of the biggest flaws here, but the blame is more on Attack of the Clones in this case. Everything is executed very well and leading up to the original trilogy is very good, even tho it does create some plot holes, but in Star Wars you can explain almost everything with the Force. And one more good thing for Jar Jar haters, he appears for only like, a second. Hooray! But there is one more thing they messed up in the ending and I'm not gonna spoil anything but that one awful line (NOOOO!). While the first two movies in the prequel trilogy were disappointing, this one makes it all better. Not everyone will like it, but as a big Star Wars fan, I must say it's a nice and intense ending for the prequels."", 'May 19, 2005 was not a simple day for fans and fans of the ""Star Wars"". It was a day when all pieces of history fell into place, finally opening a riddle that lasted more than 28 years. People imagined and thought out, wrote books and stories, collected facts and made legends, and everything for the sake of one saga, which will forever remain in the hearts of its admirers. Probably, almost every person, leaving the hall, could not convey or describe in words, what happened during these several hours in the cinema. Joyful, sad, tearful, shocked faces, slowly headed for the exit, promising to come back and see this episode again.This is the chapter of history, truly the most intense and the most powerful. It penetrates into the lungs, not allowing to breathe, touching hearts and souls. We are just spectators. But we can experience. And at some point, there is only a doomed sigh, realizing that there is no way out.Indeed, the third episode is the most cruel and tragic. There is much more pain and despair in it than in any other part. Here the republic collapses like a house of cards, turning into an empire, the Jedi perish at the hands of their ""single minded"", and the face of Anakin Skywalker forever hides the black helmet of Darth Vader. And all this inspires horror, the horror of hopelessness, when you slowly begin to understand that all this is only part of the plan, the way of a petty senator to a ruthless emperor, where everyone is just a pawn, in a huge game of the big world. And every word said accidentally becomes the key to this great puzzle, which accompanies the imperial march. But when you realize it, it\'s too late.""I swear the faithfulness of your teachings,"" whispers the future dark lord to his master with despair and devotion, asking only one thing - to save her beloved. At this moment Anakin Skywalker perishes, dies together with the republic, along with the Jedi, together with her beloved, giving birth to Darth Vader - the future tyrant, which inspires terror and fear, driven by hatred and despair, in the eyes of which something like love is reflected ... And the most terrible thing was that it was inevitable. The Jedi themselves dug themselves a pit, while the enemy stood behind them, alternately, pushing them down. This is war. Order 66. The army of clones. Padmé Anakin. Alone, these errors are not so significant, but together they form a whole madness and panic, in one hour destroying everything that the galaxy has been working on for many millennia. Therefore here the absolute evil and absolute good unite in the struggle, this cinema and consists of some contrasts. Good and bad, the Jedi and the Sith, Obi-Wan and Anakin, the emperor and Yoda, Anakin and Padmé.Such a controversial character went to Hayden Cristian. In essence, he plays two opposites in one body. Nobility and sincerity at the beginning and anger and hatred in the end. And all fear began, which slowly grew into panic, then into despair, anger, getting to hatred. It was thanks to fear that the emperor firmly grabbed Anakin\'s soul, not wanting to let go of his new servant. The glitter of embittered eyes, in which hatred for everything and the thirst for power breathe. It is difficult to imagine someone who could better cope with this task. Therefore, there are no more words left than one: ""I believe"".It\'s all over, Anakin. I\'m above you!The battle of Obi-Wan and Skywalker is what remains in memory forever. This is not just a battle between two people who have spent together their whole lives, this is a battle between two brothers who sacrificed their lives for each other\'s sake. Here, the side and skills of each are determined. Obi-Wan (in the brilliant, by the way, performance of Evan McGregor) does not try to follow the easy ways to achieve his goals. He goes to Mustafar, he understands with bitterness what is going on. Therefore, this battle is not only with the darkness, it is a battle with yourself, with your feelings and attachments. Unlike Anakin, Obi-Wan is firmly committed to duty, goals, order. For some reason, he is sorry for the most in the end. A person who, in any situation, acted as correctly, and not as easily. At the same time, we see the battle of two other opposites. Yoda and the emperor. Here, the battle goes for other concepts, for democracy, peace and freedom. The fate of the entire galaxy is being decided. And as the swords are crossed, good and evil are constantly side by side, weaving and maintaining the balance of power, crossing swords, but achieving different goals.But where did it start? Padmé Amidala, without knowing it herself, is the center of the whole string and culmination that unfolds during these few hours. A tragic figure that unwittingly became the key to the empire, from which they simply got rid of unnecessarily. Natalie Portman, like no other, fits into a gloomy sweep and the helpless panic that reigns around. Her heroine is touching and ardent, but unable to change anything, she is only an outside observer of the war and the collapse of the republic.Painful and sad ...Most of the attention of the film is given to Anakin, whose fear and sweeping increasingly turns him into the ruler of the Sith. However, about the persecution of General Grievous, powerful battles and amazing planets, also did not forget. This is a movie that will not leave anyone indifferent. Yes, and whether to restrain feelings? After all, this legend, which will be remembered.Bravo George Lucas.The highest ball.', 'And so, the Star Wars saga comes full circle, with the final pieces of the intergalactic puzzle falling into place. Of course we knew the major elements about to be revealed, but to see it done so effectively is a tribute to the epic story telling genius of creator George Lucas.I recall the controversy about the working name of Star Wars Episode VI - Revenge of the Jedi. Back in 1983 it was thought that the title suggested too much violence, and not a fitting description for the forces of the ""good"" side. But for this installment of the series, ""Revenge of the Sith"" is certainly fitting, as Anakin Skywalker\'s turn to the Dark Side under his master Chancellor Palpatine/Darth Sidious is fraught with betrayal, violence and murder.The movie opens with the same grand scope as previous films in the series, but taken to even more cosmic proportion with jaw dropping sequences of outer space grandeur. Fleet cruisers jet by gigantic space stations as naturally as city traffic. Fans of space opera will no doubt thrill to the spectacle of color and sound offered here.The relationship between Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman) and Anakin (Hayden Christensen) is handled intelligently, even as the young Jedi is manipulated and convinced by Palpatine that the future of the Republic belongs in his own capable hands as dictator of the galaxy. Padme\'s refusal to side with her husband is of course the turning point in the marriage, with the safety of her newborns of uppermost importance. I guess what bothers me most about the movie though is the reason given for Padme\'s death during childbirth, having lost her will to live. This is not the character we saw in the prior two films; after all, she had the regal bearing and demeanor of a queen, and the shrewd tenacity of a planetary senator. To just ""give up"", even under the horrendous circumstances of Anakin\'s turn is a situation not adequately dealt with in the movie.General Grievous - great name for the robotic leader of the clone army, but what\'s with the persistent cough. Perhaps it made him seem more vile, but why would a robot suffer a human malady? His running battle with Obi Wan Kenobi was a highlight of the movie.Christopher Lee - now there\'s an actor who\'s first film credit dates back to 1948, and who\'s come a long way from the horror remakes of the 1950\'s and 60\'s, to star in the two major epic movie sagas of our time - ""The Lord of the Rings"" Trilogy, and episodes II and III of the current Star Wars series. It seems he only gets better with age, as his portrayal of Count Dooku/Darth Tyranus shows.Ewan McGregor does an excellent job of preparing us for the Alec Guiness version of the Jedi Master of ""Star Wars: A New Hope"". When he appears in the latter part of the film in the straw colored robe, I immediately thought of the scene in Episode IV when Princess Leia\'s hologram image reaches out for ""Obi Wan Kenobi - you\'re my only hope"".Following the death of Jedi Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson), Darth Sidious gives the command to wipe out all the rest of the Jedi Council. Was it intentional, or merely coincidental, that the orders were carried out in the fashion of a sci-fi ""Godfather""? Only Obi Wan and Yoda had the wisdom and foresight to condemn themselves to exile so they could fight another day. Kenobi\'s mission to Tatooine to deliver the newborn Skywalker was a stroke of storytelling magic, bringing his personal adventure in the Star Wars saga full circle as well.But can the Star Wars story EVER end? The franchise lives on in a myriad of media, and it seems that there are even more adventures and characters whose stories must be told. One can only hope that the creativity and ingenuity begun by George Lucas in 1977 continues to live on in the hyper space region of entertainment known as The Star Wars Universe.', ""After watching the rise of skywalker and the sequels as a whole, I thought It would be fitting to come back here and show the love it truly deserves!Revenge of the sith is my favourite Star Wars movie, empire being the best. Obi-wan, anakin and palpatine all steal the show as George Lucas shows how to close but also open a trilogy with the perfect bridge of prequel to original trilogy! From jaw dropping lightsaber duels to great story telling it has it all! I really believe so many more will appreciate not only this movie but the prequels as a whole showing that the best way to make a Star Wars movie is originality!Though at times the script can be clunky, it sure doesn't take away the drama that continues to build throughout the movie as anakin starts to sway deeper into the dark side! Palpatines mischievous yet cunning way of turning anakin to the dark side of the force (did you ever hear the tragedy of darth plagueis the wise?). It really is the perfect bridge as we see dark aspects of the Star Wars universe (order 66) and also the fan pleasing moments and references imply what is to come!This is Star Wars!"", 'One of the best star wars movies and best scene is obi one kenobi and anakin fight', ""⭐Screenplay: 94⭐Acting Performance: 93⭐Film Editing: 88⭐Cinematography: 89⭐Visual Effects: 91⭐Sound Effects: 97 (#34)⭐Art Direction & Set Decoration: 93⭐Original Scores: 90⭐Makeup: 94⭐Costume Design: 99 (#18)_________________________________I think it is under-rated because the first two movies was not really good. The first one was bad. Second one is average but not a good Star Wars movie. But this last one is really good. I think this is the best way to connecting to the Original Trilogy after two bad movies. They've done 2 bad movies but this is really good and emotional. This is all we wanted from Star Wars. And this last movie gave that to us."", 'I love the whole saga and by that i mean all 6 original movies. Rogue One was okay at best, but sequels completely made me lost interest in SW.Even tho i like all 6 movies, prequels are the main reason i got interested in SW universe at all. Sure episode II doesn\'t hold up well, but overall Phantom Menace had lots of great moments and music. Lightsaber duel between Obi Wan/Qui-Gon Jinn vs Darth Maul was absolutely amazing. Visuals in that whole fight scene, still hold up pretty well.But Revenge of the Sith was simply something else. This is actually good movie. This is not movie where i need to point out some cool stuff that i liked, no, i like almost everything in this movie. 2005 Visuals hold up surprisingly well, duel at the end is absolutely phenomenal and easily best lightsaber duel in whole series.It\'s absolutely ridiculous to see some older people still hating prequels and at the same time claiming that they are huge Star Wars fans. I\'m sorry to break it to you, but no, you are not huge star wars fan, if you hate over half the lore. By the way Originals were never that perfect either, they have lots of goofy moments and to me that is okay, but it\'s absolute hypocrisy when some of these people hate prequels and then act like Originals are some kind of gold standard for movie making.Anyway, i\'m extremely hyped for Obi Wan show, i\'m very happy that one of my favorite SW characters, Obi-Wan Kenobi, played by great actor Ewan McGregor is finally back! This is amazing. I\'m also happy that Hayden Christensen is back, because he was solid in Episode III.From the moment ""Duel of the Fates"" started playing, it was clear to me that this show is made for people who liked prequels and this is just amazing. Finally they are brining back stuff that i truly loved about Star Wars. Like i said, i like all 6 original movies and Mandalorian was great show, but this upcoming Obi Wan show means so much more to me, than for example Mandalorian or Boba Fett.', ""It's a fantastic movie. Many would say The Empire Strikes Back is the best Star Wars series, but I personally think Revenge of the Sith is the best. Every time I watch a Star Wars movie, there are parts that get a little boring, but this movie is not at all. I know what will happen in the end, but it's so exciting to see the process. And the lightsaber battle was so good I couldn't take my eyes off it. The prequel trilogy is worth seeing on its own. I love this movie."", '.. and that\'s not saying that much. I think everyone judges every Star Wars movie by what is considered the best of the batch, the original Star Wars of 1977 and ""The Empire Strikes Back"" of 1980. Compared with those movies, this movie is not so great. Compared to the other two prequels, it is the best of the three. It turns away from the tortuous details of Senate politics that infected its predecessor, ""Attack of the Clones"", and tries to get back to the action, relationships, and moral dilemmas that are at the heart of the ""Star Wars"" series. However, this film has many flaws that could have been eradicated with more of a conscientious effort by creator, director, and writer George Lucas.It basically forms a straight line, plot-wise, from Episode Two to Episode Four with no surprises and little character development, and depends upon what you already know about the entire Star Wars mythology to invest you in this movie and its characters rather than the action and dialogue of this one particular film. Also, there is little use made of either Natalie Portman\'s Padme Amidala - who actually has very little screen time - or the excellent Samuel L. Jackson, who is completely wasted given the small part that his character has in this film. Why employ such a great actor if you are going to give him lines that any extra could deliver? Additionally, for someone who has spent the last ten or fifteen years learning and living the ways of the Jedi, Hayden Christensen\'s Anakin Skywalker seems to have very little inner turmoil making a sudden and complete transformation from protector of innocents to the apprentice of evil. He irrationally uses his desire to ensure his wife\'s safety - when there is no perceivable threat to her health other than his own premonitions - as an excuse to savage anyone who might get in his way and even some who couldn\'t if they wanted to, such as the ""younglings"" that he slaughters in the Jedi temple at Palpatine\'s behest. Thus the so-called transformation into Darth Vader is more like the flipping of a switch - more binary than analog.The best performance is that of Ian McDiarmid as Chancellor Palpatine/""The Emporer"". He has a serpentine smoothness about him as he subtly plants doubts in Skywalker\'s mind about who is really on the side of evil while deftly handling all of the warring factions of the Republic so that people will actually be grateful when he takes complete power.In summary, if you have seen all of the other Star Wars films you will probably enjoy this one because it fills in all of the gaps and answers all of the remaining questions. However, with some more effort in the direction and writing, those questions could have been answered with much better dialogue and characters that were more three-dimensional.', 'I was never one of the millions of Star Wars groupies. I enjoyed the films, except for Attack Of The Clones, but wasn\'t a huge fan. Having seen the first five, I eventually got around to checking out this last one, if for no other reason than curiosity. Wow, it changed my whole outlook.I cannot believe how impressed I was with this film, how well the writers wrapped up the whole saga and put all the pieces together. This was an excellent film, the best of the entire series. It inspired me to buy the latest DVD set which had the first three movies released and then reacquire the Clones film to complete my DVD collection of it.I\'m writing this review months after seeing ""Sith."" so it\'s just a few general thoughts. I remember thinking, after watching the wild opening, that this was going to be another one of the modern-day action films with too much action....but it settled down and wasn\'t vastly overdone in that area, although it could have toned it down a bit. Better than the action or special effects was simply the way the writers tied everything up, how Anakin Skywalker became Darth Vader, and his son wound up being the hero ""Luke"" that we saw in those early episodes of the 1970s and 1980s. The special effects were, of course, top-notch. When you go back and see those early films you really see how far Hollywood has advanced in this area. I cannot imagine how many hours of work it took the put these storyboards and computer artwork in this film, there is so much detail. It\'s mind-boggling.I know a lot of fans of this series feared the writers would mess up the final but their fears were not realized: this was a super ending to a memorable saga that endured for almost 30 years amazing.', 'To all the fans out there, it is time to rejoice. George Lucas has delivered in Revenge of the Sith. In my list of favourite Star Wars movie, it ranks up there with Empire Strikes Back in its emotional level, and action sequences.It\'s natural that this review contains no spoilers, as most of you would already know of the plot, and of the ending, since it leads to A New Hope, and given the countless slew of marketing techniques used to promote this movie.But the question is, what actually pushes Anakin Skywalker to the Dark Side. And this is the crux of the movie - if the delivery or narrative is poor and unconvincing, then this movie will sink. Fortunately, Revenge cuts to the chase, and to the point, elaborating without being boring, pacing kept consistent with breathtaking action in between serious dialogue.The best scenes in this movie is however, not the action. They are each time Supreme Chancellor Palpatine and Anakin Skywalker share a scene. After all, this movie is about the Sith, and every time these two are together, there is an ominous sign hanging that Anakin gets closer to the Dark Side, waiting for the inevitable to happen. If you\'re with Palpatine, I\'d bet you will be smittened by his subtle sweet talk of power. George has written all these scenes well, and you really feel the seduction.But what really hit the spot was Hayden Christensen\'s performance. He brought out fear in Padme\'s death in his nightmares (which was actually a self fulfilling prophecy), arrogance of his knowing his Jedi powers being improved and unmatched, confusion of his dilemma of being in a corner, torn between the Jedi Order he belongs to and his confidante Palpatine. You feel Anakin\'s sadness and loss each time he makes a mistake when doing evil deeds - you feel his tears, every time he is torn in a world of political plotting, of being an unwilling double agent.Which makes me ponder, being a child prodigy Anakin Skywalker is, it is without proper supervision that he is being seduced by false promises of unlimited Dark power. Yoda gets sent off for a mission, so does Obiwan, leaving Mace Windu (who doesn\'t like Anakin, and vice versa) looking after him. It is precisely this opportunity that Palpatine gets closer and pushes Anakin over the edge. In a way, the Jedi\'s arrogance (or probably Mace\'s) caused their downfall, and Anakin\'s love for Padme being the fuel that Palpatine openly exploits.The Jedi Massacre, though short, is extremely painful to watch. You see the Jedis trying their utmost to survive in their respective war zones, yet being murdered in cold blood by hordes of ""friendly fire"" - Order 66. It is a sense of great loss and pity, and you\'ll be holding your breath to see how Yoda survives.And yes, the lightsabre battles - this film sees the most duels in the series. Obi-wan and Anakin vs Count Dooku, Obi-wan vs General Grievious, Mace Windu vs Palpatine, Yoda vs Palpatine, and finally, Obi-wan vs Anakin. Amongst them, I would rank Obi-wan vs General Grievious the weakest of them all, despite the boast that Grievious can weld 4 sabres and fight with them simultaneously. The ones which packs a punch, are Mace vs Palpatine - the battle between the Jedi\'s best in the lightsabre swordsmanship, and the power of the Dark Side, Yoda vs Palpatine - masters of the Light and Dark side dueling, with one of them admitting failure and loss, and finally, the battle amongst brothers, Obi-wan vs Anakin. I like this one the most, as the speed and red fiery environment they do battle in, really bring out the blue glow of their lightsabres as they duke it out in fantastic speed. The only time when sabres of the same colour clash, and the best.Fan favourites like R2D2 (don\'t we love this droid!) and even Chewbacca make appearances. Jar Jar Binks too, but without dialogue. C3PO however, got limited screen time. My only gripe, if any, will be Padme being reduced to Tears - from the tough cookie she is in the prequels, probably being an expectant mother has mellowed her a lot, and she is always so sad when she comes on screen.John Williams, there seems to be no wrong he can do with his score, as his Battle of the Heroes track highlights the fight between good and evil, between the surviving Jedis and the emergence of Sith power.I would be watching this movie again, to take in the fantastic seduction scenes of the Dark Side, the sense of loss, helplessness and confusion, and the agony of betrayal from those whom you trust. Powerful themes brought out in a tribute finale to the entire series, a fitting film that bridges the past films to the Original Trilogy loved by many.May the Force be with you.', 'I was on a Combat tour in Iraq ( OIF 2004-2005 ) I watched this film at the theatre of Camp Anaconda, I thought it was the best film of the three prequels', ""Finally we have the episode3 of Star wars. So many things happens in this episode, that I need to make a summary of the things that happens. First of all, some years have passed since the Clone War. Anakin and Obi Wan are fighting as hard as they can, specially now that Palpatine was kidnapped by general Grievous, the leader of the droids army. Anakin finally menage to kill Count Dookan,( with Palpatine motivating him)and Obi Wan killed Gen. Grievous.Anakin continues to maintain the marriage with Padmé hidden, but things starts to become complicated to him when he starts to have nightmares with Padmé dying when she gave birth .Anakin becomes a sith and an apprentice from Darth Sidious, and even Padmé who could not believe that Anakin turned to be bad, is shocked by his behavior(as well as obi wan).Anakin's looks are much better then episode 2(he is more similar to Luke) and R2-D2 has more participations in this episode as the others.The clones executing order 66 has strong scenes, because seeing so many Jedis and Wookies being killed is heartbreaking for everybody who is a big fan of Star Wars.(specially when the little Jedi children are killed by Anakin's hands) This episode is the mark when the Empire begins and the Jedis fall. The only jedis alive are Yoda and Obi Wan, the first one stays isolated and the second one goes to Tatooine to give Luke to her uncle and to be watching him. (Leia and Luke are isolated from each other to be safe from the siths, and Leia stays with Senator Organa,who always wanted to adopt a little girl).We also can see Anakin's body being destroyed in the fire, and for that reason he cannot live without the black and famous suit of Darth Vader, that nowadays is an icon for every fan.Padmé only died because she gave up of living, since Anaking broke her heart. (By the way, she only dies because of Anakin himself) In his desire to make PAdmé alive, he went to the dark side and this is what makes her sad and heartbroke.(Palpatine,who is lord sidious tempted him with the offer of knowing how to produce life, and Anaking, being too much an ambitious person and angry with the jedi council that not trust him very much, became a sith.R2 and CP3O has their memory erased, that's why they don't remember anything and never told Luke about his father.*A Thing that I really don't like: 1-First, I personally think that Anakin surrendered too easily for the dark side, specially for someone who was full of doubts all the time. But in general, this the best episode from the new trilogy."", 'it is my favorite part from the series. because it presents the metamorphose of the lead character. because it is more than scene for impressive technology. because it is a story who reminds to me the impression Star Wars as religious film. because it is not exactly dark and honest and powerful but , after so many fight scenes and characters and stories around a lot of characters , Revenge of the Sith is precise. and human. that courage to be not exactly story of fireworks but the story of fears, emotions,crisis and dramatic decision , for the unique scenes from Mustafar , the film is the most complex and seductive from the entire series. because it is the bridge between new and old films from series , a bridge who seems be more important than the united parts.for the verdict than Hayden Christensen was an inspired option, for the science to give a profound sense to a story who seems be , in many occasions, too preoccupied to have large child public. a film for fans. maybe, the best from the entire series.', 'When I asked the reviewer sitting next to me to sum up Revenge of the Sith, he simply said ""great!"" That seemed to basically be the consensus of virtually everyone in attendance at an advance press screening of the final chapter in the Star Wars saga.There was an exuberant mood leaving the theater, as if everyone was in collective agreement that Lucas had finally done it. That he had gone out on top, with a stunning, rock-solid coup de grace. And from all the feedback I\'ve heard from that screening, my sense of that collective mood was right.There are no real spoilers in ROTS. Everyone basically knows what happens in Episode 4: A New Hope. We all know Anakin becomes Vader. We know Obi Wan lives and we know Luke and Leia are born. What we don\'t know is how Lucas weaves those story lines into the large, six-part opus and better yet, why?No, it\'s not a perfect movie. There are those moments that make us cringe. Bad dialog and High School drama class acting make for a few awkward moments where you can hear audible moans and giggles in the audience, but we have come to expect this from modern Star Wars films. The upside is that these moments are rare in Episode III. OK, get ready. Take a deep breath. No Jar Jar! Yes, you read that right. You can let out that deep breath now.Fortunately, we have one savior to rely on for stellar acting. Mr. Ian McDiarmid as Supreme Chancellor Palpatine. McDiarmid brings the elegance of an Alec Guiness back to the franchise in a knockout performance that leaves the audience riveted and exhausted. He is the lifeblood of the film.As someone who saw the original 30 times in it\'s first month of release at the age of 13, I currently consider myself a Star Wars moderate. I don\'t have volumes of SW merchandise, nor can I debate whether or not carbonite contains enough oxygen to make it float. All I know is that magical feeling Star Wars gave me in the original 1977 release and that I\'m happy to say, after a disappointing pair of prequels, has been finally restored and reinvigorated.Here\'s to Mr. Lucas for giving us all something spectacular to remember for our entire lives that embodies the whole point of going to the movies in the first place, to escape and lose ourselves in another world.', 'Star Wars Episode 3 Revenge of the Sith is my all time favorite Star Wars movie and hands down the best in the prequel trilogy the story was well done the lightsaber dule between Anakin And Obe wan was amazing.', 'Phantom menace was bad and attack of the clones was god awful but revenge of the sixth is a pretty good and solid movie this is what we wanted the whole prequels to be and Hayden Christiansen does a pretty good job of acting it really only has some small problems like the Vader NOOOO other then that nice fun Star Wars movie', 'After five largely odious episodes, ""Revenge of the Sith"" was rewarding enough to redeem the franchise for me. There was no theatricals, no overacting, no brinkmanship, no obnoxious teasing and taunting between the male and female protagonists and, above all, no more garish protracted scenes of ugly sentient alien beings that had driven me berserk in the previous episodes. (CGI really did the trick, I guess.) The lightsaber duel scenes were also much livelier and more fun to watch.Not to mention that the cast are actually a lot more likable! Call me a blasphemer, but there was just something terribly wrong with Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill in the first trilogy. Here you could actually feel the chemistry and love between Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen, and the two of them, along with Ewan McGregor, gave a truly natural, entertaining and coherent performance together.And then the epic story of how the Jedi warrior Anakin Skywalker, believed to be the Chosen One who would bring balance to the Force and defeat the Sith once and for all, became the Dark Lord Darth Vader, that was a whole different level of drama. The idea of good versus evil, that good always wins the war no matter how many battles it\'s lost, takes the backseat as Anakin becomes conflicted between his Jedi mentors\' rules and expectations and his love for his secret wife Senator Padmé. The movie is a masterpiece at playing out the agonizing moral ambiguity that descends upon a human when they\'re faced with threats to their loved ones, when they stand to lose what makes their life worth living. Here the concept of good and evil is blurred in Anakin\'s eyes and, quite simply, the ends begin to justify the means.Fear of loss is what leads to anger, the Jedi masters insist, and anger leads to hatred, hatred to the Dark Side. Loyalty to the Jedi Order is another tenet that the young Jedi struggles with as he realizes what his masters seem to have holding back from him about the nature of the Force.I\'m thankful they made this movie the way they did. I loved it. And it\'s woefully underrated compared to the original 1980s trilogy.', 'So much better than the first two movies. Quite dark, action sequences great. McGregor really starting to feel like OB1 now. The Saber battles seem more realistic. They fight how you would expect, no spins and showing off but gritty and with power. Good use of C3PO and R2, General Grevious good and great scenes from Palpatine and Yoda. Interesting story now as we see how Anakin was turned.Again the acting from Padme and Anakin is terrible as is the romance bits but I suppose they do lead to the road that is Vader.Some bits made no sense as in why leave Luke with the Skywalkers at all. Quite an obvious place for Vader to first check out.All in all though a great movie.', 'For several years now, it\'s been a rather uneasy proposition to be known as a STAR WARS fan. First, we had to put up with the great embarrassment of the clownish Jar Jar and the gut wrenching ""acting"" from the muppet known as Jake Lloyd in PHANTOM MENACE. Then came the laughably stilted dialog and the clumsily told love story from ATTACK OF THE CLONES. Fans far and wide were wondering what George Lucas had done to their beloved STAR WARS franchise! Something that once was so rollicking and without peer was being transformed into kiddie-pandering, muppet populated, CGI over-loaded dreck!Mr. Lucas, all is forgiven. Welcome back. REVENGE OF THE SITH is the prequel installment we\'ve been hoping for all along. Gone is the overly wooden acting and the ridiculously petrified dialog. In there place is a logical and believable storyline. Anakin\'s transformation is inexorably sensible. It is natural and not forced into shape by wooden dialog. Scenes between Anakin and Padme, are heartfelt and honest- a far cry from their nearly unwatchable scenes in ATTACK OF THE CLONES. The same can be said of scenes between Anakin and Obi Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor is legitimately great in this film. He gives Kenobi real depth and the viewer thoroughly believes that he grows up to become Alec Guiness). There exists a real bond of deep feeling the viewer can feel between master and apprentice thus making Anakin\'s fate all the more tragic, as he slowly becomes more and more entangled in Palpatine\'s (Ian McDiarmid, in a joyfully malevolent turn) web of deception and evil.Visuals have never been an issue in the prequel films and this is most certainly the case with REVENGE OF THE SITH. The opening sequence is a jaw-dropping collage of ships in movement, dazzling colors, and frenetic combat. Additionally, the technology used to create Yoda seems to have grown exponentially over the already impressive wizardry used to animate Yoda in CLONES. Front to back, the vistas Lucas shows us are entirely believable and staggering joys to behold. George Lucas goes right for the jugular in this film (the PG-13 rating is well earned! Parents be advised!!). This is a very well-told story of a fall from grace told in an unflinching manner. And yet, the hope for the future is so firmly in place as this film rolls to an end, a tear will roll down your cheek if you\'ve lived with this series of films as long as I have. STAR WARS is back. It\'s cool to be a fan again.', 'Maybe its norstalgia but this is one of my favorite movies ever. Ive seen it up to 20 times from my childhood until now beeing 20 years old and I have to say that the movie gives me a feeling no other movie was able to give. Its just this Star Wars feeling that makes these films so special. A combination of the characters, music, feelings, you know what I mean. One of my favorites.', 'ROTS is my favourite of the live action Star Wars movies. Does that make it perfect? No. There\'s some bad dialogue (""It\'s only because I\'m so in love"", ""No, it\'s because I\'m so in love with you""), Sidious killed three Jedi Council Members far too easily and Dooku only had a cameo. However, unlike TFA, which was such a pitiful excuse for a Star Wars film that I think it wounded the franchise, ROTS can stand on its own and deserves its place in Star Wars canon.First of all, the hatred for Hayden Christiansen is very unfair. People keep insulting his portrayal of Anakin Skywalker but I think he actually did a good job with what he had to work with. He spoke in a monotone but he was playing a man who was taught to control his feelings. One of Anakin\'s character flaws is that he doesn\'t understand the difference between controlling your feelings and suppressing them. To me, Hayden\'s monotone showed that Anakin was suppressing his emotions which was partially responsible for his fall. I see it as a warning about how dangerous it can be to suppress your feelings without giving them some kind of outlet. Furthermore, Hayden\'s actually rather good at acting with his expressions and body language. For example, when he was alone on Mustafar after killing the Separatists he didn\'t have a single line, but the tear track running down his face showed that part of Vader hated what he\'d become.Samuel L Jackson nailed the role of Mace Windu, particularly during his duel with Palpatine. The fight itself wasn\'t brilliant, particularly when Sidious killed the other three Jedi, but Samuel used some subtle gestures to make it work. For example, the biggest flaw in the fight, apart from the ignominious deaths of Agen Kolar, Saesee Tinn and Kit Fisto, was when Sidious held Mace at blade-point. One might wonder why he didn\'t strike Windu down then and there but to me, the way Windu spread his arms basically said ""come and have a go"", subtly undermining Sidious\' confidence and causing him to hesitate. The confidence with which Mace held himself explains why Sidious didn\'t take advantage of the opening straight away. There\'s also that tiny gesture Mace gave to Anakin when he held Sidious at blade-point, subtly motioning for him to stand back. Mace also represents all the Jedi Order\'s flaws, making him an unlikable character despite Samuel\'s excellent portrayal of him. However, I think George Lucas had the right idea when he created a character who showed how corrupt and arrogant the Jedi had become and how they were partially responsible for their own destruction.Ewan McGregor did an excellent job as Obi-Wan Kenobi. I mean no disrespect to the late Alec Guinness who was great in the Original Trilogy, but I think Ewan surpassed him. He was certainly better at lightsaber duelling and also nailed Obi-Wan\'s calm, confident presence. For example, when he jumped into the middle of a group of battle droids to confront General Grievous, he just had to say ""Hello there"" to show he meant business. He was also great at conveying Obi-Wan\'s anguish after defeating Vader on Mastafar.Natalie Portman also did a great job as Padme, although the explanation for Padme\'s death was a bit weak, and Leia shouldn\'t have been able to remember her since she\'d only just been born. Padme\'s most powerful line in the film was ""So this is how liberty dies... with thunderous applause"". ROTS, AOTC and TPM taught me not to trust politics and I think that although the political scenes were dull, they were essential for the story. I\'m grateful that George Lucas warned me about the dangers of politics. I think the weakest part of the Prequels is Padme\'s romance with Anakin but Natalie and Hayden both did a very good job in the scene where Anakin found out that Padme was pregnant.Ian McDiarmid seemed to love being Darth Sidious. He could portray Sidious\' subtle, calculating, manipulative side but when Sidious was able to use his powers openly, he absolutely loved it, behaving like a complete psycho. He was over-the-top when killing Mace and battling Yoda but he also did well in quieter moments.Christopher Lee only had a cameo, but in the short time he had, he BECAME Count Dooku. He nailed Dooku\'s arrogance but when he was on his knees in front of Anakin, you can see the fear in his eyes. General Grievous was a much weaker villain. In addition to being a coward, Grievous didn\'t stand a chance against Obi-Wan in lightsaber combat, although he did nearly kill him in hand to hand combat, albeit only because of his mechanical body.George Lucas isn\'t a great script writer but he possesses intelligence, creativity and passion and it clearly shows in this film. ROTS isn\'t a perfect film but I think the good things about it make up for its flaws.', ""Not only is this the best star wars prequel, but the best star wars film in the entire saga and here is why, I appreciate how it has a dark theme, all of the actors do an amazing job, and Anakin's turn to the dark side is brilliant, and it's a perfect setup for the original trilogy, and speaking of the original trilogy, it also answers a lot of questions from the original trilogy for those who didn't read the book series, such as how is darth Vader Luke's father, how did Darth Vader come to be, why was obi wan hiding away, and many more, I'd give it a 10/10, but the other 2 prequels we're disappointing, and the music, oh my god, the music is perfectly timed and not a bad soundtrack in the bunch."", 'For three years, The Clone Wars have raged across the galaxy, as Republic and Separatist forces fight for dominance.A crucial battle high over the planet Coruscant, has Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) and Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), attempt a daring rescue of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) from General Grievous\' command ship.upon finding the Chancellor, they encounter Count Dooku (Christopher Lee), who engages the two Jedi. He manages to incapacitate Obi-Wan, but Anakin ends up getting the upper-hand, leading to the Chancellor requesting that Dooku be killed. Anakin hesitates, but eventually decapitates Dooku.The three attempt to escape the ship, before Grievous finds out where they are, and captures them. Bringing them to his ship\'s bridge, the Jedi thanks to R2-D2), create a diversion, causing Grievous to flee his ship, but also jettison all the escape pods.As the ship begins to plummet into the planet\'s upper-atmosphere, Anakin attempts a daring crash-landing, that manages to get them back onto the planet, rescuing the Chancellor.After these events, Anakin is reunited with his wife, Padmé Amidala (Natalie Portman), who tells him that she is pregnant. Despite Padmé\'s worries over their secret marriage, Anakin is overjoyed at this news, and the couple begin making plans to raise their child. However, Anakin is troubled by visions of Padmé dying in childbirth, and the fears of how he was unable to save his mother resurface. Seeking council from Jedi Master Yoda (Frank Oz), Anakin is unwilling to take the master\'s advice to not develop strong attachments, lest greed lead him to The Dark Side of the Force.Following the meeting, Palpatine meets with Anakin, and requests he be the chancellor\'s ""personal representative"" on the Jedi Council. Such an appointment would automatically make Anakin a Jedi Master, but as the council did not make this decision, they reach a compromise: Anakin may sit on the council per the Chancellors wishes, but not be given the rank of Master, leading to Anakin becoming angered at this decision.Following a council meeting wherein it is decided that Yoda is to go to Kashyyk to assist the Wookies in fighting against the Separatists, Anakin is concerned when Obi-Wan tells him off-the-record, that that council wish him to spy on the Chancellor, suspicious of his actions. Anakin appears to accept the request, but grows further disillusioned by the council, asking him to spy on someone he trusts.Anakin grows even more upset when Padme claims she feels the Republic is growing more corrupt, and asks him to talk to the Chancellor to help end the war and resume diplomacy.One evening, Anakin is called to the Coruscant Opera House for a private meeting with the Chancellor, who tells him that they have found General Grievous and the Separatist leaders hiding on the planet Utapau. Palpatine then requests Anakin sit with him, and confides in Anakin, that he believes the Jedi want to overthrow him, and take over the Republic. Anakin attempts to defend the Jedi, but finds himself conflicted.It is then that Palpatine starts telling him about a Sith legend, revolving around Darth Plagueis the Wise, who could use the powers of the Dark Side to save people from dying. This catches Anakin\'s attention, but Palpatine warns Anakin, that such powers cannot be wielded by a Jedi.Following the news of Grievous\' whereabouts, the council decides to send Obi-Wan Kenobi to take on Grievous, going against the Chancellor\'s recommendation to have Anakin sent. Anakin is at first upset, but after some time to reflect, he sees Obi-Wan off, and apologizes for his frustrations as of late. Obi-Wan confides in his friend that he feels that Skywalker will eventually become a master, but just needs to be patient.Obi-Wan eventually engages General Grievous, and Anakin is sent by the council to tell the news to Palpatine.Upon reaching Palpatine\'s office, the chancellor then reveals to Anakin that he is a Sith Lord. However, given what Palpatine has told him, Anakin is unable to bring himself to strike down Palpatine, feeling he knows how to save Padme.Anakin then returns to the Jedi Temple, only to find that Obi-Wan has killed Grievous, and Mace Windo (Samuel L Jackson) and other Jedi are going to make sure that the emergency powers the chancellor has, are returned to the Senate...which is when Anakin reveals that Palpatine is a Sith Lord. This news changes Windu\'s plans, and he orders Anakin to wait in the council chambers until he and the others return.Anakin attempts to stay calm, but figures the Jedi will kill Palpatine...and with him, will go the secret to keeping his wife alive.Jumping in a ship, Anakin returns to the Chancellor\'s office, only to find Windu holding Palpatine at saber-point. The chancellor attempts to fight off Windu with force-lightning, which the Jedi deflects back on Palpatine, causing his face to take on a hideous visage.Anakin claims Palpatine must stand trial, but Windu is determined to kill the Sith Lord, but not before Anakin intervenes, slicing off Windu\'s hand, and leading to Palpatine blasting the Jedi Master with force lightning, and throwing him out a nearby window.Reeling from the realization that he attacked one of his superiors, Anakin is unsure what to do, until Palpatine requests he become his apprentice and learn the powers of the Dark Side. Anakin pledges his service to the dark lord, and is then \'knighted,\' as Darth Vader.Palpatine then claims that the Jedi must all be destroyed, otherwise they will plunge the Republic into civil war. Anakin is then tasked with destroying those in The Jedi Temple, before going to Mustafar, to destroy the Separatist Leaders and end the war.While Anakin leads an attack on the temple, Palpatine reaches out to clone commanders across the galaxy, executing \'Order 66,\' which causes all the clones to turn on their Jedi Generals. Once his dark deeds are finished, Anakin goes to Padme, claiming he saw Mace Windu attempt to kill Palpatine, and claiming that his allegiance now lies with the Chancellor. He then tells Padme he must go to Mustafar, and intends to end the war, once and for all.Senator Bail Organa (Jimmy Smits) happens to see the temple attack, but is turned away by clone troopers. As he attempts to leave, he sees a young Jedi attempt to fight them off, before the troopers kill him. Escaping from the temple, Organa is concerned for the Jedi, and going aboard his ship, heads off into space to see if he can find others. He soon encounters Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi, who managed to escape. Yoda claims a retreat signal is also being broadcast from the Jedi Temple, and Obi-Wan recommends they go back there to stop it, to keep any other Jedi from returning and being killed.Upon their return to Coruscant, Bail is requested to attend an emergency meeting of the Congress. While the Yoda and Obi-Wan sneak off to the temple, Bail meets with Amidala in the Senate, where the two hear Palpatine declare that \'the Jedi rebellion has been foiled,\' after they attempted to overthrow the Senate. Promising to wipe out the remaining Jedi, Palpatine then declares that the Republic will now be re-organized into The Galactic Empire, much to the horror of Padme and Bail, but to thunderous applause from those around them who believe the Emperor\'s lies.Back at the temple, Obi-Wan and Yoda have succeeded in infiltrating the ruins, but the massacre of even the temple\'s Younglings has Obi-wan shaken. After taking care of the code, Obi-Wan finds security hologram footage...and is shaken when he sees Anakin has committed these acts, pledging his fealty to Palpatine. Yoda claims they must destroy the Sith, and goes off to fight Palpatine, leaving Obi-Wan to find Anakin.Obi-Wan goes to Padme, who is unwilling to believe the claims that her husband has turned to the Dark Side, or tell Obi-Wan that she knows where he is. Obi-Wan also senses that Padme is pregnant, but can only apologize for what he knows he must do concerning the baby\'s father.Meanwhile, Anakin has eliminated the Separatist Leaders per Palpatine\'s orders. After reporting on these events to Palpatine, the Sith Lord tells his apprentice to have the Separatist\'s droid units be shut down immediately.After her meeting with Obi-Wan, Padme heads to Mustafar, where she confronts Anakin. Telling of what Obi-Wan explained to her, Anakin claims Obi-Wan is lying, and that he is now powerful enough to not only protect her, but powerful enough that the two of them can rule the galaxy. These words cause Padme to feel Anakin has gone too far, but as she struggles to make him see reason, Anakin sees Obi-Wan aboard her ship, and angrily assumes she brought Kenobi there to kill him! In a blind rage, Anakin attempts to choke his wife, before she passes out. When Anakin claims those not with him are his enemy, Obi-Wan pulls out his lightsaber, and the two begin a fierce duel.Back on Coruscant, Yoda confronts Palpatine. a lightsaber fight ensues, and the two soon find themselves in the Senate chambers, eventually using the senate\'s pods as weapons, before Yoda realizes the Sith Lord is too powerful to overcome. Using a commlink, Yoda calls for Bail to come to the Senate, and the Jedi Master is saved, but sadly feels he has failed to stop the Sith.Back on Mustafar, the duel between Anakin and Obi-Wan takes them through the Separatist\'s hideout, then out onto a river of lava. Eventually, Obi-Wan force-jumps onto a nearby hill. When he claims Anakin should not follow, the Sith Apprentice refuses to back down, and attempts to jump over the Jedi. Kenobi takes the chance to slice at Anakin, cutting off his limbs, and send him tumbling down to the edge of the lava river.As Obi-Wan watches, Anakin\'s clothing catches fire from the river, and the Master\'s apprentice screams in pain and agony, as Kenobi takes Anakin\'s saber and leaves, hoping the fires will do what the Jedi Master could not.Some time later, having sensed that his apprentice was in danger, Palpatine arrives on Mustafar. The apprentice is then taken to an Imperial medical facility on Coruscant, where begins the painful task of trying to save Anakin.Meanwhile, Obi-Wan has taken Padme to a distant asteroid, wherein they are met by Yoda and Bail Organa. A medical examination shows Padme appears to be healthy, but seems to have lost the will to live. It is also revealed that she is pregnant with twins, and the medical droids work quickly to save the babies. Padme manages to see each of them, naming them Luke and Leia. Following the births, Padme tells Obi-Wan that she still believes some good exists in Anakin, before she expires.Back on Coruscant, Anakin has been rebuilt into an imposing figure in black, the suit he is now in, the one thing keeping him alive. As he inquires about Padme, Palpatine claims in Anakin\'s anger, she died. This becomes a bitter blow to the once promising Jedi, who sacrificed everything...but now finds out he has lost everything to his greed.Following Padme\'s death, her body is returned to Naboo. To keep her children safe, Bail Organa takes Leia to be his adopted daughter on Alderaan, while Obi-Wan takes Luke to his uncle and aunt on Tatooine. Yoda also tells Obi-Wan that while he will watch over Luke, he has training for him to conduct.On Bail\'s ship, he also leaves C-3PO and R2-D2 in the care of the ship\'s Captain, telling the loyal crew member to have the protocol droid\'s mind wiped.On Naboo, a massive funeral is held for the former Queen.On a Star Destroyer, the Emperor and Vader are now supervising the early stages of a super-weapon, called The Death Star.On Alderaan, Bail returns to his wife, and hands her their new, adopted daughter.On Tatooine, Obi-Wan hands Luke over to his uncle and aunt. As he walks off into the desert, the young couple stare at the twin suns rising over their homestead.']"
6,Star Wars,The Force Awakens,2488496,"['I have never been a huge fan of the Star Wars films--especially after the last three films they made. Too often, in my opinion, the emphasis was merchandising cute characters to kids instead of making the best possible sci-fi film. Fortunately, now that George Lucas sold off the franchise, Disney actually has made a slightly darker and slightly more adult addition to the franchise...and I was thoroughly impressed.I really DON\'T want to talk about the plot of ""The Force Awakens""-- mostly because the movie just debuted and I would prefer folks experience it themselves. However, I don\'t think it spoils it in any way to say that the film is a bit of the old and a bit of the new. So, folks who loved the earlier films (particularly the great ones) will be happy that the film is clearly Star Wars and has a lot of similar plot elements from the earlier movies. You also get to see some familiar faces. But there also are several new ones and they seem to have a bit more depth than usual. I particularly liked Finn (John Boyega) and Rey (Daisy Ridley)--they were not just formulaic characters and you really like and respect them.The bottom line is that the film very much kept my interest and Disney seemed much more focused on story and, especially, characterization. A thoroughly enjoyable film from start to finish.', ""Loved the original 'Star Wars' films as a kid, still do. Especially 'Empire Strikes Back' while considering 'A New Hope' a genre landmark. Didn't think the prequel films were that bad personally, but they had a lot wrong with them and were a long way from great, especially 'Attack of the Clones'.Despite seeing 'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens' around the time it first came out (maybe a little after), there was a long time of being put off by the vitriolic hate it's gotten here and the practical war zone there is in order to review it (even when it was critically acclaimed). Finally mustering the courage, count me in as somebody who loved 'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens'. A masterpiece? No. Better than the prequels? Absolutely, and although some may disagree this is saying a lot. The best 'Star Wars' film since 'The Return of the Jedi?' Yes.'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens' is not the most original plot-wise. It has been criticised for being a re-hash of 'A New Hope', understandably. However, instead of being done in a cheap and slap-in-the-face way, it felt like an affectionate and nostalgic homage. Exemplified by bringing back major characters from the original trilogy in supporting roles. JJ Abrams, and this may be considered blasphemy, does a much better job here than he did with his 'Star Trek' reboot films, here he keeps the original spirit of the original trilogy intact while giving the film its own identity at the same time.While it certainly dazzles in spectacle and action, 'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens' doesn't feel too big, too noisy or too chaotic at the expense of creating memorable characters, a fun story and brains and heart. The characters are memorable with easily identifiable leads, the original trilogy characters bringing a lot of affectionate nostalgia and a well executed if not iconic (not by Darth Vader standards anyhow) villain in Kylo Ren (unpredictable and dangerous but feeling he is morally justified).The story lacks originality but more than makes up for it in energy, non-stop heart-thumping thrills and excitement, generosity, a cheerfulness that is positively space operatic, vibrant charm and a few fresh twists along the way. In many ways it is a celebration of the universe while also an expansion of it. It is sometimes sentimental but never overly so, one crucial death scene is just heart-wrenching (particularly Chewbacca's reaction) and doesn't feel like a slap in the face to the character in question.Could the villains have been better written? Ren is fine but Snoke only just about works as a character thanks to the visual effects and especially the powerfully enigmatic with a touch of vulnerability performance of Andy Serkis, other than that the character is underwritten. Also felt that Gwendoline Christie's character was unnecessary, so limited was her screen time.Visually, 'Star Wars: Episode VII- The Force Awakens' is a triumph. It is gorgeously shot and designed with Abrams' visual storytelling shining far more here than it has in other films he's done. The special effects are a dazzling marvel. John Williams delivers yet another rousing score that has its own character but cleverly includes the well-known iconic themes from the previous films. Thank goodness that the dialogue contains little to none of the cheesiness heard in the prequels, and it even has more layers than that of the original trilogy.Acting also shines, with winning charismatic performances from John Boyega and particularly Daisy Ridley. Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher still have it, while Max Von Sydow shows himself to be a master of gestures and eye contact speaking louder than words. Adam Driver is a suitably menacing Ren and Serkis makes much of his somewhat underwritten character. Oscar Isaac gives a typically strong performance.In conclusion, a great film, the best 'Star Wars' film since 'The Return of the Jedi' and one of the best of the saga too. 9/10 Bethany Cox"", ""Unlike many moviegoers, I couldn't care less about the STAR WARS franchise these days. Sure, I grew up with the original trilogy, which I still know and love, but George Lucas single-handedly destroyed the goodwill surrounding those movies with his mishandling of the prequels. The good news is that THE FORCE AWAKENS - a genuine sequel to RETURN OF THE JEDI - is better than the prequels, but only just. Because this is a deeply flawed movie that gets ten things wrong for everything it gets right. While it's a delight to see Harrison Ford effortlessly breezing back into one of his most iconic roles, the rest of the production is a mixed bag of good and bad, of the woeful and the wonderful.Inevitably, the special effects are one of the strongest things here. The copious use of the CGI looks better than ever, and the alien planets involved in the story are all well realised. You can't fault the large-scale action sequences, which look great in high definition, and as a whole the film is a visual treat. A shame, then, that the story is so weak and a virtual retread of the first STAR WARS film, A NEW HOPE, made all those years ago. The new villains are laughable and Adam Driver's attempts at an iconic baddie along the lines of Darth Vader are quite pitiful. The starkiller stuff is as predictable as it gets, and you wonder why they couldn't go in a fresh and new direction instead of simply regurgitating what has come previously.The new characters don't fare very well either. John Boyega, who was so good in ATTACK THE BLOCK, struggles with a put-on American accent that rings hollow. Daisy Ridley is even worse: this newcomer seems to have overdosed on Keira Knightley performances, copying Knightley's style of acting throughout and feeling completely artificial as a result. All of her lines sound cheesy and wooden, and frankly I felt embarrassed watching her attempting to act alongside the more seasoned actors. It says something that the droid, BB-8, was my favourite of the new characters, given that his high 'cuteness' factor is a shamelessly manipulative attempt to endear him to audiences. Add in a non-ending of a film that merely opens the door for the next inevitable instalment, and you have an oddly hollow film that looks nice but falls apart as soon as you start picking at it."", ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) *** (out of 4) I'm pretty sure every person on Earth know what the film is about and just in case you don't I'm not going to spoil anything here in regards to the plot. Yes, it's basically a reworking of A NEW HOPE with the old and new characters being brought together to go up against the Dark Side.STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS was probably the most anticipated movie in recent memory and as no shocked it turned out to be a massive hit. I predicted when I heard that it was going to be made that it would eventually become the top grossing movie ever made. It hasn't quite reached that mark as of me writing this but I'm sure it will happen. So, we know it was a massive hit but how was the actual movie? I'm not a major STAR WARS fan but this one here isn't nearly as good as episodes four through six. How could it be? With that said I must admit that I found the film to be extremely entertaining, which is all I was personally asking for. I thought J.J. Abrams did a very good job at building up the new characters and the new story while also keeping the original trilogy fans happy. I thought the screenplay was clever in how the old characters were brought into this new story and I won't complain about any of the events that happen in regards to the story.The special effects, as you'd expect, are spectacular and they certainly push the level in regards to what can be done today. The various space battles were tremendous to look at and best of all is that they feel 100% authentic and real. There wasn't a single battle where you didn't feel as if you were right there in the action and this is always a major plus. Another thing are that the robotic characters are all well-designed and manage to fit right in with the series. The film is full of wonderful action scenes and all of them are full of terrific atmosphere.Performance wise, against I'm not going to spoil anything major so all I will say is that the original three actors are all excellent in how they are used. The new people like Daisy Ridley, JOhn Boyega, Oscar Isaac and Adam Driver all are good and I think fans have a nice cast to take this series into the future. Of course, we also have Chewbacca back, which is always fun.The film does have some flaws and I think some of it is based around the humor. The film goes for a lot of humor and I thought a lot of it didn't work all that well. Ford and Chewbacca get some nice moments together but many times the jokes fell flat. I'd also say that the film ran on a tad bit too long but the ending was so wonderful that it was fun once it came. STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS is really just a set-up for what's to follow and it certainly has me excited for what comes next."", ""It's over 30 years since the defeat of the empire. The Republic is threatened by the First Order led by Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) under the control of Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis). The resistance led by General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) is fighting the Dark Side. Finn (John Boyega) is a conflicted stormtrooper. Rey (Daisy Ridley) is a scavenger on the planet Jakku. Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) is the Resistance ace pilot.It has been over 30 years since the last truly good Star Wars movie. It is a great reboot and a solid repair job to the damage from the prequels. The biggest complaint seems to be that this is a repeat of A New Hope. If anything, this is pulling out scenes and references from all three originals. I have no problems with that. In fact, it's good to go back and take pages out of the original trilogy. Even the force is explained more in the traditional way. However, this is not a simple repeat. The new characters are tremendous. John Boyega and Daisy Ridley are amazing additions. He's an interesting character and I love their initial meeting. I love him keep grabbing her hand. There are some minor problems but they're too minor to mention especially considering the spoilers. I rank 'The Empire Strikes Back' (1980) the best, 'A New Hope' (1977) second, and I may squeeze 'The Force Awakens' slightly ahead of 'Return of the Jedi' (1983). Forget the prequels.P.S. In this one, nobody loses a lightsaber fight because of elevation."", 'I saw Quentin Tarentino on Stephen Colbert the other night. He pointed out that no matter what movie he\'s gone to, he always remembers that it is still a movie...that he never falls into the spell to where he forgets. People say they do. He doesn\'t. I deliberately stayed away from any reviews or comments on this film. But I couldn\'t avoid all of the hype and that hype, by its very nature, made me constantly aware I was watching a movie that was going to make huge sums of money. I\'m having trouble separating myself from that sense of ""why did they do this?"" And ""why did they choose her."" And, ""Isn\'t Harrison Ford a stitch."" Not Han Solo but Harrison Ford. Anyway, I have to admit that I sort of enjoyed it. It has lots of action, some interesting characters, a nostalgic feel, and so on. And a force is a force of course, of course. I skipped work so I could be at the first screening of the first ""Star Wars"" film back in 1977. I have to admit that as a reader of much challenging science fiction, I found the whole thing pretty bland. But it is a cultural entity, it bears watching. I don\'t know that there was much new here that would make one want badly to come back for more. When I saw the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, I marked my calendar, hoping I would live to see all three episodes. And in that one, I already knew the plot. I\'ll be interested to see how this holds up to the test of time. For me the second set of the films are quite forgettable. And, again, for me, only one of the original caught my interest.', 'maybe, I am too old for a new beginning. but the enthusiasm for the new part of Star Wars remains low. not ignoring its admirable virtues - young actors giving life to new characters, meet with old friends, beautiful cinematography, presence of Max van Sydow, a seductive new character and a mysterious one. but, out of the small lovely gifts , essential is a big problem - the film has not a story. its story. pieces from the other parts of series are puts together. all is well known and the promise for another eight parts not could save very much.sure, it is only the beginning. and the target is a new generation. but the first detail looking for in the case of Star Wars is discover the roots of events. in this case , maybe, the roots are reduced at the humor demonstration. or at shocking solutions as the death of Han Solo. but,expecting new parts, you must hope the better.', 'Now the title of this review is probably the ultimate compliment when it comes to huge Star Wars fans out there. Unfortunately I am not one of them. I liked the old films and I liked this new movie here just as much, without considering either to be groundbreaking or some other superlative. This new movie runs for 2 hours and 15 minutes and was written and directed by J.J. Abrams, who is mostly known for ""Lost"" and ""Star Trek"". It is the ultimate breakthrough movie for John Boyega, but even more so Daisy Ridley. And while I liked the latter, I thought that it was so nice to see Oscar Isaac as usual. Cool reunion also from ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" with Adam Driver here, even if the two had no scenes together. Fans of the old ""Star Wars"" film will appreciate the inclusion of Harrison Ford, who has lots of screen time, Carrie Fisher, who has solid screen time, and Mark Hamill, who has almost no screen time, but it is indicated that he will make a much bigger impact in the next film.This new ""Star Wars"" film managed no less than five Academy Award nominations, all in the technical categories and this also describes the film perfectly. Yes there are some interesting plot developments and characters, but it\'s really all about the technical side. Music, effects, editing etc. are all really good. The acting is mostly fine, but nothing to rave about. This does also include Harrison Ford, who has a truly baity supporting role here and I am a bit shocked he got no awards attention for his turn here. He and Driver also share the most dramatic and emotionally crucial scene of the film during their interaction on a bridge. Oh yeah and let us not forget about the light saber action scenes. These are truly cool to watch, no denying. There are a couple more famous names included here and the one I want to mention as well is Domhnall Gleeson, who is having an amazing year with all the films he is in.Finally, I also liked the little robot and Chewbacca of course, who bring some solid comic relief, certainly more than most of the ""human"" characters\' one-liners that weren\'t as funny as they were intended to be. All in all, this film was pretty much what I expected. Great action and impressive visually (check it out on the big screen), but not really convincing in terms of story and character development. The financial success does not come surprising at all though. The brand is obviously as much in demand as always. I believe it was a good watch and if you like science fiction more than I do, you will probably have an even better watch and appreciate this film even more than I did. This does not say, of course, that I did not like it. On the contrary, I had a pretty good time and it\'s certainly an achievement for a film with that runtime that I almost never felt it dragged. Thumbs up and nice cliffhanger ending too. I will certainly watch the next one as well.', '1977 was a big year in the cinema. Star Wars (later titled Episode IV-A New Hope) came out. It was a big year for me as well. I went to see my first James Bond film in the cinema. Star Wars I saw some years later on television, which as my brother said 20 minutes in. It is just some characters walking in the desert.JJ Abrams who ran out of ideas by the time he went on to direct Star Trek: Into Darkness has not waited long to reuse old ideas for Star Wars 7. Just as Creed carries on the Rocky saga by going back to Rocky 1 & 2, Abrams with Lawrence Kasdan & Michael Arndt has gone back to A New Hope to set up this new trilogy.We are back to the world of Star Wars and with advances in technology, special effects, CGI and animatronics we have not advanced much in visuals from the original trilogy which is over 30 years old from The Return of the Jedi. The visuals are uninspired and rather lazy.We have a Tattooine like planet where a young woman, Rey meets a droid carrying important information regarding Luke Skywalker. Rey comes across Finn a storm-trooper who has had a reawakening of his own and met a rebel fighter to escape.Rey seems to be feeling the force and in a series of coincidences or I guess the power of the force escapes her pursuers in a wreck which turns out to be the Millennium Falcon and later comes across Han Solo and Chewbacca.That is not all the Darth Vader like baddie is the grandson of Darth Vader, the son of Han and Princess Leia who has gone over to the dark side but still conflicted with the power of good. Their will be a father and son reunion and you can all guess how this will turn out as the scene is reminiscent of when Obi Wan encountered Darth Vader.It is entertaining, they put on all the right beats with action scenes coming at the right time and some humour, star cameos such as Daniel Craig voicing a storm-trooper or an actress, Harriet Walter who is the niece of Christopher Lee. It is just the story has been recycled and you think that after 30 years, this is the best they could do?If Lucas wanted a new trilogy he might has well remastered and re- edited his original trilogy because I know where this is heading.', 'Thirty years after the fall of the Galactic Empire, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is vanished and there is a new threat to the Republic: The First Order under the command of the Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis). General Leia (Carrie Fisher) from the Resistance has sent her best pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) to the planet Jakku to get a map with the location of her brother. However, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and the Stormtroopers destroy the village and Poe hides the map in his droid BB- 8 before he is captured. Ren wants to kill the last Jedi and needs to know his whereabouts. But the Stormtrooper FN-2187 (John Boyega) saves Poe and flees with him in a TIE fighter. Poe calls him Finn, but they crash on Jakku and Finn survives while Poe disappears. Meanwhile the scavenger teenager Rey (Daisy Ridley) finds BB-8 and brings him to the trade camp. But Ren discovered that BB-8 has the map and attacks Jakku. However Rey, Finn and BB-8 steal the Millennium Falcon that is left in a junkyard and escape from Jakku. When the spacecraft breaks down in space, they meet Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca. They have an incident with gangs but they succeed to go to the Resistance base, but Rey is captured by Ren. But the Resistance learns that the huge Starkiller Base is powering a weapon to destroy their planet and now their only chance to destroy the weapon depends on Han Solo, Chewbacca and Finn that wants to save Rey. All the fans had great expectations with ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"", but the film has an unoriginal story. The franchise is orphan of George Lucas and the new writers were not able to create anything new. The Death Star is replaced by the Starkiller Base. Darth Vader, the father of Luke Skywalker, is replaced by Kylo Ren, the son of Han Solo and Leia. R2-D2 is replaced by BB-8. Senator Palpatine, or Darth Sidious, is replaced by the Supreme Leader Snoke. The destruction of the weapon depends of the explosion of the power generator. There are so many similarities in the story of ""The Force Awakens"" with the other episodes that gives the sensation of déjà vu. In addition, the characters are poorly developed. All good things should come to an end, but greed is the root of all evil. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Star Wars: O Despertar da Força"" (""Star Wars: The Awekening of the Force"")', ""By all accounts, this film really shouldn't work as well as it does. Looking at it in the cold light of day it is essentially a repeat of the original film in terms of narrative – albeit with some details changed and all the characters moved sideways by a generation. So we have the same parent/child divide, the same innocent discovering their power, right down to the same finale with a large planet-sized weapon. Associated with this it also rides very heavily on nostalgia and brand recognition so that we probably accept a lot of plotting conveniences that we would scoff at in a film we came into cold. However, even seeing all these things, it is hard not to love it for how well it works.It does this by getting the balanced right between all the many aspects that the film seeks to pull together. So we have the nostalgia and a very familiar narrative, but at the same time we have a story that is delivered in a way that engages and is surprisingly moving at times (albeit due to that self-same nostalgia and reliance on us already being invested in this universe and the characters). It also manages to be fun but yet also able to transition into darker moments without one damaging our enjoyment of the other. This is what makes it work I think – because it is really an enjoyable film to watch. It never really stops moving, and the characters are rather thin, but within this frame they work and are engaging.The cast are a big part of that, and it is a very well-cast piece given that the new faces are not dominated by the old familiar ones. Boyega makes good on that charisma he showed when playing the lead in Attach the Block, while Ridley is really natural and likable. For all the fuss over a black storm trooper and a female 'Luke', the truth is that both do a great job regardless of race/color – but do bring that extra factor into play (I had a daughter recently, and it did rather focus my mind on the deficient of strong female characters who are played for themselves, not for their sexuality). The cast is deep in familiar faces and really everyone is on good form – Fisher perhaps seems there because she has to be, but it was nice to see Ford manage to have a bit of a twinkle back in his eyes. The volume of familiar faces in tiny roles does get a bit distracting (particularly if you have watched any shows from Abrams and know his usual cast) but this is a minor thing since the film otherwise does a very good job of keeping you with it for all its adventure and fun.Such a hyped film with such weight on its shoulders really shouldn't be able to be so light on its feet while also delivering dramatic and emotional moments, but it does. A really enjoyable Star Wars film that delivers a lot – and regardless what George Lucas thinks, it has been a very long time since that was the case."", 'The opening sequence informs us Luke is missing and the ""First Order"" has replaced ""The Empire."" It is lead by another helmet covered Dark Lord whose identity is revealed about 50-60 minutes into the film. By this time the other two major characters are developed.Finn (John Boyega) is a storm trooper who joins the resistance. He becomes a love interest, or so it seems (unless they are somehow brother and sister, they did that twist before) of Rey.Rey (Daisy Ridley) is a tech savvy fighter who on one occasion takes a Katniss pose. Her parentage is not revealed in this film, but she acts similar to another famous character and my guess she is the granddaughter of...Oh c\'mon they make it obvious.For those who loved the old Star Wars (and I think that is why we are here) there are plenty of identical lines and similar scenes from the original films, including a cantina, search for a droid, and a Death Star type battle...not to mention that scene of which we do not speak.The role of the Emperor is now the Snoke (Andy Serkis) who looks like a giant Lord Voldemort, perhaps the worse part of the production.The film hits upon the nostalgia elements using the same sound track to create emotional and heart pumping scenes. And yes, we can guess the sequel will look like ""The Empire Strikes Back"" because original writing is scarce and that is what sells tickets.Guide: No F-bombs, sex, or nudity.', 'Although if you either dismiss Episode 1-3 it could also be ""the fourth Awakens"". But back to this one and let me begin with, that I\'m not even close to being in the top of the biggest fans, when it comes to Star Wars. I came late to the party and enjoyed the movies (some more, some less) and am not obsessed with the whole thing. Always liked Han Solo, especially the way Ford portrayed him.Having said that and not being able to be too detailed on every little inside joke, I can tell you that this feels like a Star Wars movie to me. Maybe it\'s on the surface and maybe some feel it is even too close to the Originals (copying certain things, paying respect as others would describe it). It\'s just the beginning of a new trilogy and 2016 has another Star Wars movie lined up, that is more of a spin off. So to see what the repercussions are (for surviving characters), you\'ll have to wait until 2017. As it is and as cliché as some things go down (like our main ""bad guy"" here, so misunderstood as he would possibly say himself) and as predictable as others are, you will have a couple of wow moments and giving the new female lead some power to be doing stuff rather than just being there, this has a lot going for it.Maybe not the best Star Wars movie out there and interestingly enough the reaction was either love or hate (do people really think of this being worse than Episode 1? Wow). Embrace it for what it is, because it does capture what George Lucas was trying to do back in the day ...', 'I\'ve taken my time getting to this review, having seen the movie twice and allowing nearly three thousand other reviewers take their shot at the picture. I have mixed feelings about ""The Force Awakens"". As a stand alone movie I think it works well enough. It\'s got the CGI enhanced battle action down pat and the new characters add some fresh blood to the Star Wars universe which most of us expected. This is where I think I\'ll insert the \'but\'.....To quote Han Solo from my summary line above - ""This is not how I thought the day was gonna go."" Another way to say it is - ""Where was the magic""? I think I probably speak for anyone old enough to have been around for the original ""Star Wars"" in 1977. The first time you saw a land cruiser, or a hologram image of Princess Leia, or walked into the Mos Eisley cantina - man, that was magic. The legend of Obi Wan Kenobi had a mystery to it and you couldn\'t wait for that mystery to reveal itself.With this movie, it doesn\'t feel like the principals involved were interested in exploring a distant galaxy far, far away, instead directing their energy to the land of here and now. There wasn\'t so much a story here as the next evolution in computer generated special effects and characters created to appeal to a diverse cross section of movie goers. All well and good, but I think most Star Wars fans would welcome some serious character development and a story arc that anticipates an eventful wind up to the Star Wars saga. I don\'t expect that we\'ll get that now.Here\'s the one thing that did intrigue me out of the whole movie though, and I haven\'t read anyone else comment on it. When Han Solo follows Kylo Ren out to the bridge of the Star Killer base, he shouts out \'BEN\' to which his son responds. See, this is the magic I was talking about earlier. It sounded to me like Kylo Ren was named after Ben Kenobi. If only the rest of the story could have been that cool.', 'It was inevitable that they were going to milk the franchise long after the story assumed to be done. ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" brings back the characters from episodes 4-6 and adds some new ones. Given the frequent one-liners and self-references, I get the feeling that the aim is to make all the nerds/geeks have fun. I will say that unlike ""The Phantom Menace"", I understood the plot this time; with the former, I didn\'t understand the plot until I listened to ""Weird Al"" Yankovic\'s song ""The Saga Begins"" (a parody of ""American Pie"").So, it\'s no masterpiece. The plot is mainly two hours of light saber fighting and shooting lasers. Basically, if you go in expecting nothing more than stuff that\'s meant to appeal to the characters on ""The Big Bang Theory"", then you won\'t be disappointed. If anything important came out of the movie, I\'d say that it\'s Carrie Fisher\'s shutting down of people who have nothing better to do than comment on her age.That\'s all that I have to say about this movie.', 'Disney paid over $4 billion to buy Lucasfilm, George Lucas himself served as creative consultant, I was super excited about a new movie, and the original stars returning, it was just a question of whether the acquisition was worth it, forget the prequels (no Jar Jar Binks), directed by J. J. Abrams (Lost, Mission: Impossible III, Star Trek, Super 8). Basically, it\'s been 30 years since the destruction of the second Death Star, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), the last Jedi, has disappeared, the remains of the fallen Galactic Empire have risen and become The First Order, seeking to eliminate Skywalker and the Republic, the Resistance, backed by the Republic, are led by Luke\'s sister, Princess Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher), opposing the First Order and searching for Luke. On the planet Jakku, Resistance pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) obtains a map to Luke\'s location from village elder Lor San Tekka (Max von Sydow), Stormtroopers, commanded by Kylo Ren (What If\'s Adam Driver), destroy the village and capture Poe, his droid BB-8 escapes with the map, and comes across scavenger Rey (introducing Daisy Ridley) at a junkyard settlement. The First Order Stormtrooper FN-2187 (Attack the Block\'s John Boyega) is unable to kill, gets away, frees Poe and they escape in a stolen TIE fighter, Poe gives him the new name ""Finn"". Poe and Finn crash on Jakku, Finn appears to be the only survivor, he finds Rey and BB-8 in the village, the First Order find them and attack, the three flee the planet in the stolen, rundown Millennium Falcon. Following a chase and escape, the Falcon breaks down and is captured by a larger ship, piloted by Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew and Joonas Suotamo), they reclaim their former ship, finding Rey and Finn, Han explains that Luke tried to rebuild the Jedi Order, but a student turned to the Dark Side, Luke went into exile and all he built was destroyed. The five escape on the Falcon when attacked by criminal gangs, the gangs inform the First Order of Han\'s involvement, the Falcon lands on the planet Takodana, the group meet cantina owner Maz Kanata (12 Years a Slave\'s Lupita Nyong\'o), who can help BB-8 reach the Resistance, Rey finds Luke Skywalker\'s lightsaber, it also belonged to his father Anakin. The First Order have converted a planet into a superweapon capable of destroying star systems, Starkiller Base, Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) orders General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) to use the weapon for the first time to destroy the Republic capital and its fleet, Snoke tells Ren he must kill his father, Han Solo. Takodana is attacked by the First Order, Finn uses the lightsaber in a fight, Resistance X-wing fighters save Finn, Han and Chewbacca, they are led by Poe, but Rey is captured and taken to Starkiller Base, she resists Ren\'s interrogation and mind-reading, and Rey discovers her powers of the Force, using a Jedi mind trick to escape her cell. Han, Chewbacca, Finn and BB-8 meet Leia at the Resistance base on D\'Qar, droid C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) explains that R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) has been inactive since Luke\'s disappearance, the group learn that BB- 8\'s map to Luke\'s location is incomplete. The Resistance plan to lower the planetary shield of Starkiller Base, before it will fire on D\'Qar, so the fighters can attack, Leia asks Han to bring their son back alive; Han, Chewbacca and Finn infiltrate the base in the Falcon, the shield is lowered and Rey is found, and explosives are set. They encounter Ren, Han confronts him, using his birth name Ben, and implores him to turn from the Dark Side, but Ren kills his father Han, Chewbacca shoots Ren and sets off the explosives, the Resistance X-wing fighters therefore attack the weapon and the Starkiller Base is destroyed in a chain reaction. Injured Ren chases Finn and Rey to the surface, Finn is injured in a fight using the lightsaber, Rey takes it and overpowers Ren, who is wounded, they are finally separated by the ground crumbling, Snoke orders General Hux to evacuate and bring Ren to him, while Rey, Chewbacca and Finn escape in the Falcon. The Resistance celebrate victory on On D\'Qar, but Leia, Chewbacca and Rey mourn Han\'s death, R2-D2 awakens and reveals the rest of the map, Rey follows this to an island on a distant planet, and there she finds Luke Skywalker, offering him his lightsaber.

Ford, Fisher and Hamill returning makes the nostalgia all the more fun, newcomers Ridley and Boyega are fantastic talents, and Driver a great choice for villain, supporting cast members do great as well. I was hoping the feel of the fantastic originals would be reignited, I\'m happy to say it met all my expectations, the story is well written and played out, the chase and fight sequences are highly exciting, and the special effects are amazing, this truly is a return to the good old days and I cannot wait for the next, a brilliant science-fiction fantasy action adventure. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Film Editing, Best Music, Original Score for John Williams, Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound Editing, and Best Visual Effects, and it won the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Production Design, Best Original Music, and Best Sound. Star Wars was number 24 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Outstanding!', ""Thirty years after the destruction of the second Death Star and the overthrow of the Empire a new force has risen from its ashes; the First Order. Luke Skywalker, the last Jedi, has disappeared and both the First Order and rebels, who are now known as The Resistance are searching for him. A map to his location has been found and given to rebel pilot Poe Dameron but the First Order's storm troopers attack before he can get it back to the resistance\x85 he gives the map to his droid, BB-8, and tells it to get far away.Dameron is captured buy the sinister Kylo Ren but is helped to escape by defecting storm trooper FN-2187, soon renamed Finn. Their flight doesn't get them far though; they crash and it looks as though Dameron is dead. Meanwhile BB-8 is found by a scavenger named Rey; she shortly meets with Finn and, thinking he is in the resistance they manage to escape in a familiar ship.Their journey to the resistance base will bring them into contact with some familiar characters and into many life of death situations. We also learn why Luke has disappeared and the connection between Kylo Ren and the central trio from the original 'Star Wars' films.Anybody who has seen the original 'Star Wars' film will find the plot of this film very similar; this may be a problem for some viewers but I found myself really enjoying this and think it was probably the best film in the series since 'The Empire Strikes Back'\x85 it is helped by the lack of things like Ewoks and Jar Jar Binks! The new characters were pretty impressive, in particular Rey and Finn. Their characters developed nicely through the film; this was particularly true of Rey as she starts to discover her strength in using The Force; thankfully the writers didn't rush to explain why she was so strong; no doubt we'll learn in later films. It was great to see many original characters even though Luke's appearance can best be described as a cameo or even a teaser as to what is to come in episode eight. While the overall story doesn't feature any major twists there is one very surprising moment for those who have managed to avoid spoilers. The cast does a solid job; newcomers Daisy Ridley and John Boyega were great as Rey and Finn and of the original cast members Harrison Ford stands out as he has the most prominent role. The film features plenty of exciting action as some humorous moments which thankfully don't feel too forced. Overall I really enjoyed this film and heartily recommend it to fans of the original films."", 'I have just come back home from the cinema after having spent the evening there with my family watching the new ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"". And I am thrilled, excited and ecstatic.There was a big hype about ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"", and you would have to be living in a cave somewhere if that had eluded you. And no wonder that there was so much hype about it, because director J.J. Abrams did have some rather big shoes to fill out after taking over from legendary George Lucas. And then just how did he manage to do? In my honest opinion, then J.J. Abrams did an amazing job, hand on heart.And having grown up with ""Star Wars"" and loving the franchise, then I was also anticipating the movie and looking forward to seeing what J.J. Abrams would bring to the table. And I think that after the last three movies - parts one, two and three - in the legacy, then it could be nothing but better. And yes, J.J. Abrams succeeded and picked up the torch nicely and continuing in the spirit of the original trilogy - parts four, five and six.Story-wise, then J.J. Abrams was working on the continuation of the last movie ""Star Wars: Return of the Jedi"", and this seventh movie was set 30 years after the defeat of the Empire and the destruction of the second Death Star; being the end of the ""Star Wars: Return of the Jedi"" movie. And while ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" boasts a completely new array of characters, then the return of the core essential characters from the original trilogy (parts four, five and six) return to part seven as well.So just how did these new characters fit into the legacy and the story that J.J. Abrams told in ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens""? Personally, I must admit that I think that the character gallery was amazing, and the talents cast to play the roles were really nicely chosen and were doing really good jobs in bringing the characters to life on the screen. Of course Luke Skywalker (played by Mark Hamill), Han Solo (played by Harrison Ford), Leia Organa (played by Carrie Fisher), C3P0 (played by Anthony Daniels), R2D2 (played by Kenny Baker) and Chewbacca (played by Peter Mayhew) need no introduction. But the new characters introduced in ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" did prove really good and had lots of variety. Rey (played by Daisy Ridley), Finn (played by John Boyega), Poe Dameron (played by Oscar Isaac) and Kylo Ren (played by Adam Driver) did prove to be good characters that will be memorable as those in the original trilogy. However, and yes there is a however, I didn\'t really think that the villainous Kylo Ren was all that impressive, just seemed like a cheap knock off of Darth Vader, to be honest.And while we are on the topic of the new characters, then I am excited to see the next movies and follow the stories of these newly established characters. But also to follow the continued story of the heroes from the original trilogy.The storyline told in ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" was good, and I had all my hopes and wishes fulfilled by J.J. Abrams\'s storytelling, and he really did a good job in continuing the timeless space saga. However, there was just too many parallels to the first movies. I mean, a galactic power force that has built a massive weapon capable of destroying planets, and a small force of opposition attempting to foil their plans. It had been done twice already, so on that account, Abrams did leave us hardcore fans with a somewhat dry sensation in our mouths. But the story told around the core characters was good, thrilling and fast-paced. And I think that he managed to incorporate a good many things and details for each individual character and tie them together nicely for a greater picture.And having the special effects team return to physical effects and not rely on CGI as they did in parts one, two and three was a good thing, because they returned to how they worked their magic in parts four, five and six. And the special effects guys really went back to the roots with lots of details, fabulous creatures, great costumes and captured that unique ""Star Wars"" sensation. And boy was that magic back with a vengeance. I was completely blown away with all the details and touches added to this movie. And the space dogfights was just exciting like you wouldn\'t believe. It was like you were there yourself.Yes, I am a fan of ""Star Wars"", that is no secret and no doubt about it, and it warms my heart to have this glorious return to the original trilogy, and to see it leave the work of George Lucas in parts one, two and three far, far behind in its wake.""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" is exactly what was needed to put new life into the franchise, especially after the massacre the franchise was exposed to with parts one, two and three. And on that account, then J.J. Abrams deserves a massive applause for this accomplishment with this movie. I respectfully salute thee.If you enjoy the ""Star Wars"" saga, then you should embrace ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" with open arms, because it really is a majestic return to the atmosphere and sensation of the original trilogy.', ""A fairly long time ago, in a county not so far away (Elstree Studios are an hour's drive away from yours truly), a great adventure took place. Now, J.J. Abrams, in league with the 'House of Mouse', has returned to make a seventh chapter in the franchise, and it's almost identical in plot to the first film, but with only a fraction of the magic and charm.Daisy Ridley plays Luke\x85 sorry, I mean Rey\x85 a scavenger on the desert planet of Tatooine\x85sorry, I mean Jakku\x85 who becomes involved in the rebellion against The Empire\x85 sorry I mean The First Order\x85 after she bumps into R2D2\x85 sorry, I mean BB-8\x85, a droid carrying plans to the death star\x85 sorry, I mean to the whereabouts of Luke Skywalker. Meanwhile, the First Order are preparing their new weapon, the Death Star\x85 sorry, I mean Starkiller Base\x85 for use against the rebellion, who are forced to launch a risky counter-attack that sees Rey coming face-to-face with masked villain Darth Vader\x85sorry, I mean Kylo Ren (Adam Driver).I've learnt to keep my expectations low for Star Wars films since The Phantom Menace, so I can't say The Force Awakens was a massive disappointment; it is what I feared it would be—a rather safe reboot, lacking in fresh ideas, which aims to please younger viewers with flashy visuals, whilst pandering to the older generation by including sly nods to the original trilogy. Personally, I would much rather they had taken a bolder approach: let's be honest\x85 they couldn't have got it any more wrong than the prequels.There's a spark of originality in the form of Finn (John Boyega), a stormtrooper who has a change of heart and joins the rebellion, the production design and effects are incredible, and I admit that the return of Han Solo and Chewbacca warmed even my cynical heart, but on the whole I was left wanting by this latest instalment, particularly the final assault on the Starkiller Base, which was completely bereft of tension. In fact, my favourite moment of the whole film is when Carrie Fisher tries to convey anguish, but her plastic surgery doesn't let her."", ""My wife and I enjoyed this at home on DVD from our local public library. JJ Abrams did a good job directing this movie mostly in the style of the original Star Wars movies beginning in 1977. I've been around long enough to remember them well and the positive stir they created. I had a good friend who became a giant fan of the robot C3PO, who also makes an appearance here, 38 years after the original.Most of the running time and action involve a set of new, mostly younger actors. The bad guys want to control the galaxy (far, far away) and part of their plan is to find and eliminate Luke Skywalker, believed to be hidden away in a remote location. A map, stored on a solid state device, is the key.For me the most fun was their bringing back the main actors (and their characters) from the originals. Harrison Ford, who was in his 30s when all this started, is now in his 70s as Han Solo. His old ship, the Millennium Falcon relegated to a junkyard, serves a key role in the battles and as an escape vehicle. Mark Hamill is back as Luke Skywalker, Carrie Fisher is back as Princess Leia who has become a general, and Peter Mayhew, all 7 feet and 3 inches of him, is back as Chewbacca.Good movie and very entertaining, we enjoyed it.SPOILERS: Solo and Leia have a son, who has inherited some of his grandfather's (Darth Vader) powers is also leading the effort of the bad guys. There is a confrontation between him and Solo, where dad is trying to talk him into abandoning the dark side, but the son puts his lightsaber through Han who apparently then falls to his death."", ""Somehow, even with all the hatred, Star Wars: The Force Awakens managed to bring in 2 billion. Obviously the box office is no indication of whether or not a movie is good. The appeal was the reuniting of the original cast - Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, and Luke Hamill, along with Chewie and 3CPO, and to introduce some new characters to carry on in the next films.I have to admit, it looked like a big video game to me. What I enjoyed the most was Ford, particularly his repartee with Chewy. For me, it was great to see Fisher and Hamill again.These films that take place in space are yesterday's westerns and war movies. It used to be the science fiction films, the Buck Rogers, Superman, Dick Tracy etc., were B movies. Once the computer and CGI came in, they quickly became A films, perfect for the big screen. Someone once told me that most movies are made for 15-year-old boys in Thailand. It makes sense - I mean, what was there to grasp about this film that a 15-year-old non-English speaking person couldn't grasp? I haven't followed this franchise much since the first three films, though I did see the Anakin Skywalker-Natalie Portman movie. I think it's fairly obvious that this film brings us back to the original Star Wars. Harrison Ford was paid $10,000 for the first Star Wars. His salary is higher now and he has a percentage of the box office. He's old, he looks old, but you can't beat him. He's an old-fashioned movie star in an old-fashioned movie. I didn't feel that Carrie Fisher had enough to do though I enjoyed her.So why give this an 8? Why? It was fun, it was entertaining, I loved the original stars. The new people -- Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, and Oscar Isaac are all attractive and are very good. Will I go and see the next Star Wars? Probably, because Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher are in it and somehow, so is Harrison Ford. That to me is Star Wars."", 'So the good news to report first is that J.J. Abrams is someone who loves Star Wars enough that he more than respects the mythology, which itself is cobbled together from past mythological stories, both old (back to the Greeks with the Gods) and modern (serials and comics), but also recognizes that in this \'Episode\' series as a saga a lot of it has to come back to family. The Force Awakens works tremendously when it focuses on the two (maybe three) new characters who are introduced in this series, and the familiar is both welcome and sometimes questionable, but mostly welcome all the same. It\'s a movie made for the fans, but it\'s not necessarily a ""fan-film"", if that makes sense. It\'s the logical progression of this franchise in 2015 and by a filmmaker like Abrams it\'s a commendable effort (if not great, read on for more, and of course SPOILERS be ahead).First of all, the first act of this movie is magnificent. New heroes are introduced, one of which, a deflecting Stormtrooper for the newly formed First Order named Finn (though it\'s technically not his real name, and oddly enough his given name is an in-joke for ANH fans), is remarkable. I loved this character as someone who did seem like a new presence - not someone who is a space pirate or destined for something greater, just a guy who was raised to do just one thing and has a conscience and decides to act on it. As played by John Boyega he\'s the best part of the movie overall for me (yes, even with mother-f***ing Han Solo and the new cute droid BB8 included), and he gives Finn passion and fire and occasional humor but is a fully formed character; he\'s fulfilling the promise seen in him in Attack the Block, and I can\'t wait to see more of his character in the next episodes.Likewise Daisy Ridley, a new actress relatively, is very good as Rey - though she at first is another character (or I should say archetype) that\'s familiar via Joseph Campbell as the Hero Destined for a Journey, Ridley gives her spunk and equal fire to Boyega, and it\'s a joy to see how they meet and join forces in the first act. Everything about this opening is so strong, a lot of it told without dialog (and when it does come in it feels simple but just right somehow) that it\'s a shame that the rest of the film doesn\'t quite live up. And it\'s not that the quality jumps off a cliff, but, for me, this first act of shaping this new world, the new evils (Adam Driver as the new sort of ""Darth"" Kylo Ren), hits its high point once Han Solo (Harrison Ford, acting like he\'d never left the role, he\'s just there) and Chewbacca come in to the picture.In a way the \'spine\' of the movie, in other words the events that lead everyone from point A to B to C, are really close to that of A New Hope. At the same time, I got the feeling like Abrams, probably knowing this would be his only shot at making a Star Wars movie (whether he wants to do one again is his call, but I believe he\'s declined), has put EVERYTHING he\'d want to do in a SW movie in one film. This isn\'t necessarily a bad thing, and Abrams passion for thios world comes through in almost every frame. But it almost feels a little cramped by the time the last act comes around and as our heroes face off against Kylo Ren (following the death of a pretty damn prominent character, sort of in keeping with the family-tragedy line of the series, I can\'t even bring myself to say it), there\'s the ""Starkiller"" Base, which is basically the Death Star on steroids.It\'s a much darker film than I expected. Matter of fact, the third act has the sort of pacing issues to the point I almost forgot about the Starkiller Base plan, and it had not really much urgency considering its level of threat. It\'s also a little unclear just how FAST a particular character gets Jedi-Force powers (the explanation of Rey having them is fine, but it seems like just how quickly is too much, as if she would need more, say, training to do ALL that she does, and comes off more like a story contrivance). And by the time it gets to this section of the film, where emotions are really high but callbacks are still done - even to things like, say, a trash compactor, or an Admiral Ackbar appearance - it\'s a bit much.The number of gripes that I can ponder over are many... and yet I still recommend the film highly. For all the little faults in the storytelling or little bits of deus ex machina (at one point involving a split in the ground that separates two characters in a dual at just the right moment), this is a full-bloodied, extremely well directed, shot with fire in the cinematographer\'s cortex (and a lack of unnecessary lens flares!) Star Wars movie. In the ways that ultimately count, in the spine as I mentioned, its familiarity is in keeping with how this saga has been unfolding over six films, with familial bonds and the mystical element of the Force guiding things in directions of good and/vs evil. It does what the 2009 Star Trek film, also from Abrams, did so well: reintroduce us to this universe with energy and spunk, give fans and newcomers what they want, and allow some new actors to act their buts off while giving veterans a chance to shine.Oh, and BB8 is cute as a button. If only R2 had more screen time for them as a buddy-droid team...', ""As someone who grew up watching the original trilogy (that's the ones from '77-'83 that starred Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, and Carrie Fisher), I was a little stoked to watch this one with those three returning. Ford appears the most in this and he makes the most of his presence. The funniest lines are from him and it's such a joy when he's on screen. Ms. Fisher doesn't seem as charismatic as in her previous stints as Leia but she's still pretty good at what she's required being now an older version of her. She and Ford have some nice scenes together. Hamill doesn't appear much so we'll have to wait for the next one in the series to see how he fares though I did like his beard at the end. The new players, mainly Finn and Rey, are good enough as characters. J.J. Abrams does a good enough job taking over for George Lucas. This was quite exciting for me and my movie theatre-working friend. So on that note, I recommend Star Wars: The Force Awakens."", 'One can only have deep respect and admiration for a genius individual like J.J. Abrams\x85 I think one of the most difficult things to accomplish in the film industry is to revive a legendary and immeasurably popular franchise, but Abrams achieved in doing so not just once – with ""Star Trek"" – but now twice, with the even more astounding new ""Star Wars"" installment. ""Star Trek"" and ""Star Wars"" aren\'t just your average type of successful Sci-Fi movies, no, they became so humongous that they became immortal cult phenomena with millions of obsessive fans, countless of spin-offs and imitations and merchandising business that started to lead a life of their own. In order to appeal to this many skeptical and demanding fans, your film just has to be really, REALLY good! ""Episode VII: The Force Awakens"" is a fantastic film, and even though I\'m not an avid ""Star Wars"" admirer, it was the first one since ""The Empire Strikes Back"" that truly impressed and overwhelmed me. Episodes I, II and III, that were released between 1999 and 2005 and directed by George Lucas himself, were not exactly worshiped by the die-hard SW-fans. Arguably that\'s because Mr. Lucas wrote and directed the prequels from a creator\'s point of view and not enough from a fan-boy\'s perspective. Abrams clearly is a big fan of the saga and probably knows more about Lucas\' creation than he does himself, and that makes him the ideal person to helm the next generation of Star Wars cinema. ""The Force Awakens"" has a solid and absorbing scenario, breathtaking decors and set-pieces, spectacular action scenes (brought to an even higher level of awesomeness thanks to the exquisite 3D) and – perhaps the most important of all – a truly excellent and versatile cast of characters. First and foremost there\'s the return of some legendary heroes, of course, like Han Solo and Chewbacca, but also the newly introduced protagonists are fascinating characters. Personally, I\'ve always been most attracted to the Dark Side, so I adored the new and powerful foe Kylo Ren (and particularly his private mental battle), the relentless army General Hux and the rather disturbing Supreme Leader Snoke. But also the good guys are extremely likable, like tough girl Rey and the reshaped Stormtrooper Finn. I can\'t wait for episodes 8 and 9!', ""Despite the huge love there is out there for 'Star Wars' after the lukewarm response the prequels gained rebooting the saga was always a risk. Especially when there was so much hype about how 'great' this film was bound to be.And to be fair it is a good film and in my opinion one of the best in the saga. It has a lot of action, a logical and clear plot and all the new actors fit in with the stars from the originals such as Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher.Of the old crew it is Ford who has the lion share of the screen time and yet again oozes charisma as Han Solo. His interactions with Daisy Ridley (who herself shines) is great and mirrors the Obi Wan/Luke set up of 'A New Hope'.Yes, there are flaws and the plot does feel a little like a remix of what's gone before, but Abrams has achieved his goal of bringing 'Star Wars' back to the head of the sci fi table."", 'Luke Skywalker has vanished. In his absence, the sinister FIRST ORDER has risen from the ashes of the Empire and will not rest until Skywalker, the last Jedi, has been destroyed. With the support of the REPUBLIC, General Leia Organa leads a brave RESISTANCE. She is desperate to find her brother Luke and gain his help in restoring peace and justice to the galaxy. Leia has sent her most daring pilot on a secret mission to Jakku, where an old ally has discovered a clue to Lukes whereabouts.The First Order, led by the evil Kylo Ren, is landing stormtroopers to attack a small village, as Poe Dameron meets with Lor San Tekka in a hut. He is given a small bag containing the map to Luke Skywalker. Kylo Ren orders the stormtroopers to destroy Lor San Tekka\'s entire village and takes Poe captive. Captain Phasma, a stormtrooper wearing chrome-plated armor, leads the attack. Kylo Ren wears a black mask and uses a red, fiery lightsaber. Poe\'s X-Wing is damaged so that he cannot escape, so the pilot puts the map in a rolling droid unit called BB-8. He fires at Kylo Ren, who uses the Force to block a blaster bolt. As Dameron is captured, the troopers massacre the prisoners, but one stormtrooper FN-2187, refuses to fire. Meanwhile BB-8 rolls away across the sands, narrowly escaping capture.\nThe droid runs into Rey, a young scavenger who is barely surviving on Jakku. Rey scavenges parts from old wrecks of Star Destroyers on the sands of Jakku, and exchanges them for food at Unkar Plutt\'s scrap yard. The marks on the walls of her hut indicate she\'s been on Jakku for a very long time. She rescues BB-8 from a Teedo scavenger. She can understand his beeps and whistles, and offers him shelter for the night.On the First Order destroyer, Poe is unsuccessfully interrogated by the First Order. Kylo Ren is called in to use his Force powers to extract information from Poe about the whereabouts of the map. Poe resists, but ultimately divulges that the map is still on Jakku in his BB-8 unit.Meanwhile Captain Phasma confronts FN-2187 about his behavior on Jakku. She orders him to take his unused blaster in for inspection and report to her division and ultimately reconditioning. Instead FN-2187 decides to run away. He needs a pilot to escape the star destroyer, so he rescues Poe, and the two board a black First Order TIE fighter and escape. Poe renames FN-2187 as Finn, and expertly pilots to an escape while Finn fires the ship\'s blasters. The fighter is hit by lasers from the destroyer and crash lands on Jakku. Finn has ejected but it appears Poe has gone down with the ship leaving only his jacket.Finn wanders across the desert discarding his stormtrooper armor. Eventually, he arrives in Niima Outpost, the town where Rey trades scrap for food. While Finn is looking for water in the town, he sees Rey being accosted by two of Unkar Plutt\'s henchmen who are trying to make off with BB-8. He begins to rush to her aid, but before he gets far, Rey handily fights off her attackers using her staff. Clearly, she can handle herself. BB-8 spots Finn looking their way, and tells Rey that he is wearing Poe\'s jacket which they assume is stolen. Rey chases Finn down, knocks him to the ground and confronts Finn about the jacket. Finn tells them that Poe was captured by the First Order and that he helped him escape, but Poe was unfortunately killed. BB-8 is saddened and rolls off , but Rey is excited and impressed, and assumes Finn is a resistance fighter. Finn lies, telling her he is indeed with the resistance. Rey excitedly tells Finn that BB-8 is on a secret mission. Finn tells her BB-8 is carrying a map to Luke Skywalker and Rey is even more impressed, declaring that she thought Skywalker was a myth.BB-8 returns and alerts Finn and Rey that they are in trouble. First Order stormtroopers are now looking for Finn and the BB-8 droid. Stormtroopers chase Finn, Rey and BB-8 through Niima Outpost and TIE fighters are called in and begin to bomb and strafe the town. To make their escape, they steal a ""garbage"" vehicle to escape the First Order. It is the Millennium Falcon. Rey takes the pilot\'s seat while Finn mans the guns. Neither is confident in their abilities, and their lift off is rough, destroying a substantial portion of the town as they try to get off of the ground. Finn is able to shoot down a pursuing fighter, but the guns are hit and locked in a position that prevents him from taking out the remaining fighter. Rey flies through the wrecked ships in the desert of Jakku, occasionally scraping through the sands as they try to keep low to confuse the TIE fighter\'s tracking. Rey takes the Falcon into one of the Star Destroyers and just as the pursuing fighter locks onto their ship, she turns the Falcon out into the open, and performs a flip which allows Finn to fire successfully at the remaining fighter, taking it down. They head off, away from Jakku, and on toward the wider galaxy. Not having flown in years, the Falcon is not in good repair, and almost immediately requires an emergency patch. Rey begins repairing the ship while Finn admits to BB-8 he is not part of the resistance, but is still able to convince BB-8 to tell them where the Resistance base is.The Falcon is then captured and pulled into a larger ship. Finn is afraid they have been recaptured by the First Order. As the Falcon is boarded, he and Rey hide in a secret compartment, but the boarding party is actually Han Solo and Chewbacca.Rey knows the history of the ship, and how to repair and fly it. Han is impressed, but the ship is then boarded by two more smuggler parties. Han is trying his hand at smuggling again, this time by carrying some menacing Rathtars. Han tries to talk his way out of his debts with the two smuggling groups while Rey and Finn escape. Rey tries to close blast doors to save Han, but instead opens the doors to the Rathtar containers. The Rathtars attack and eat the smugglers and almost get Finn, but Rey saves him by closing a door on the creature\'s tentacles, severing them. The heros escape in the Millennium Falcon and leave their attackers behind.\nThe new-found allies travel to the green planet of Takodana to seek help from Maz Kanata, an orange skinned alien. There they are spotted in the cantina by both First Order and Resistance spies. Kylo Ren sends forces to re-capture the map. Finn, still fearful of being recaptured by the First Order, admits that he is not part of the Resistance and decides to run by joining a crew heading for the outer rim.Meanwhile Rey is drawn to the lower floor of the cantina by the sound of a girl crying and opens a box to discover Luke Skywalkers lightsaber lost at Cloud City. When she touches the lightsaber she experiences a frightening vision. The dream has the voices of old Jedi like Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda. It flashes by quickly. She sees the hallways of Cloud City, a vision of Skywalker and R2-D2, a vision of Kylo Ren surrounded by bodies, thrusting his saber through the chest of a mysterious figure, a vision of herself being abandoned as a child on Jakku and finally she sees Ren pursing her in a snowy forest.On Starkiller Base, a snowy, mountainous planet, General Hux addresses legions of First Order stormtroopers. He angrily declares the death of the Republic. The planet has a massive trench around the equator, and a continent-sized aperture. The base fires a massive red beam from the center of the planet, traveling across space, and splitting into four separate beams which destroy individual planets. We see crowds of people on populated planets look up into the sky to witness the conflagration as their planet is destroyed.Rey is frightened by her vision and refuses Luke\'s lightsaber, running out into the forest of Takodana. Finn and the others look to the sky as the red beams can be seen destroying the other Republic planets. The First Order begin landing troops, including Kylo Ren\'s V-winged ship. Maz gives the lightsaber to Finn. As the stormtroopers attack Finn uses the lightsaber to fight back, but is knocked down by another stormtrooper (unnamed, but popularly referred to as TR-8R). The stormtroopers capture Han, Chewbacca and Finn.Rey tries to use the blaster given to her by Han Solo, but inexperienced and frightened she fumbles with the safety and fires wild shots giving away her position. Overwhelmed she runs deeper into the forest. BB-8 follows, and she tells him to go further on while she tries to fight off their pursuers. Kylo Ren tracks down Rey in the woods. He chases her through the forest easily fending off her desperate attempts to fire on him with the blaster. She backs away, but he stops her, using the Force to hold her still. Ren uses the Force to read her mind and discovers that she has seen the map to Luke Skywalker\'s location. He decides he no longer needs BB-8, so he knocks her out and carries her off in his ship, as Finn watches.The Resistance X-wing fighters arrive, finishing off the last troops. A troop ship lands carrying General Leia Organa and C-3P0. Han and Leia are reunited, but their relations are tense. It is revealed that Kylo Ren is actually their son. The heroes return to the Resistance Base, where Finn is reunited with Poe Dameron, who was not killed by the crash on Jakku. BB-8 is reunited with R2-D2 and C-3P0, but R2-D2 has been in shut down since Luke left many years before.The Resistance fighters begin to plan an attack on the Starkiller Base to avoid being wiped out. Finn wants to rescue Rey, and claims he once worked at Starkiller Base and knows how to knock out the shields. Han and Leia say their goodbyes as the X-wings led by Poe Dameron prepare to attack a weak point on the base. As they part Leia asks Han to bring their son home if he sees him.On Starkiller Base, Rey wakes to find her self locked in an interrogation chair like the one we have seen earlier in Poe\'s interrogation scene. Kylo Ren and she converse, and he removes his mask, revealing his face to her; he is a young and handsome man. Ren uses the Force to read Rey\'s mind. He senses her lonely life on Jakku, her dreams of a far away island and the closeness she feels towards Han Solo. She reacts with hostility but seems unable to keep him from reading her thoughts.When he tries to extract the information about the map from her mind, however, he runs up against an unexpected barrier. Rey is not only able to resist his further probing, but pushes back into Ren\'s mind, and tells him that he is afraid that he will never be as strong as Darth Vader. Ren is shaken by this and by her obvious strength with the Force, and he runs away to meet with Snoke in search of guidance on how to proceed.Kylo Ren and General Hux are scolded for not retrieving the droid, and Ren\'s inability to crack Rey\'s mind, by the Supreme Leader, who is only revealed as a massive hologram of an old and scarred man seated on a throne towering over them.Rey now understands that she has some Force talent, and uses the mind-trick power to escape from the stormtrooper guarding her cell. She sneaks through the Starkiller Base to the hanger to escape. Meanwhile, Han and Chewie come out of hyperspace on the planet in order to evade the shields, and crash land in the snowy forest. Finn reveals he does not know how to disable the shields; he only came back to rescue Rey. They capture Captain Phasma and force her to lower the shields.Finn, Han and Chewbacca head off to find Rey, but quickly discover that she has freed herself when they spot her scaling a wall of the base. They rush to meet her. She is surprised that they would come back for her, and embraces Finn when she learns from Chewbacca that it was Finn\'s idea that they come to the base to save her.Poe and the X-Wing fighters arrive and begin to land torpedos on the weak point, but it is not enough. Han and Chewbacca improvise a plan to plant explosives to blow it up instead. They split up to lay explosives in separate locations. Kylo Ren finds that Rey has escaped and is very angry. He searches the base for Rey. He stalks off onto a catwalk where Han spots him. Han approaches him on the catwalk, calling him Ben. He asks his son to return with him, and Ren offers his lightsaber, but then activates it and kills his father, pushing him off into the pit. Chewbacca, having watched the entire conversation, fires on Ren, hitting him in the side, and then detonates the explosives.Kylo Ren confronts Finn and Rey in the snowy forest. Ren is bleeding from his wound, but ignites his red fiery saber to fight. Rey raises her blaster to fire on Ren, but he throws her against a tree with a Force push and she lies unconscious in the snow. Finn rushes to her aid and then uses the blue lightsaber to fight Ren. Finn quickly finds himself outmatched. He manages to touch Ren with the saber, but this only enrages him.Rey is revived by the sound of Finn\'s screams as he is burned by Ren\'s saber. Ren easily disarms Finn, tossing the saber off into the snow. He then uses the Force to pull the lightsaber to himself. It hurtles towards him but then flies past. Ren turns to discover the saber in Rey\'s hands. They begin to fight. Rey initially fights unsuccessfully and desperately, and begins to run from Ren. He pursues her and pins her against the edge of a cliff. Ren offers to teach her the Force, but this only ends up reminding her to tap into its power. She closes her eyes for a moment of meditation and then attacks Ren with a new vigor and power. She rapidly gains the upper hand, extinguishes Ren\'s saber and cuts him on the arm and across the face.Meanwhile Poe Dameron and the X-Wing pilots fly into the Star Killer base trench, destroying the rest of the base. The planet begins to collapse and explode. A chasm opens between Ren and Rey as the planet continues to fall apart. Chewbacca arrives in the Millennium Falcon to pick up both Finn and Rey. The Falcon and X-Wings escape as the Starkiller Base explodes. Back at the Resistance base, Leia and Rey embrace in sadness, standing apart from the celebration of the rest of the Resistance base.Back at the Resistance Base, R2-D2 awakens and reveals the missing part of the map to Lukes location. Finn is still unconscious, and Rey tells him goodbye while he rests. Rey and Chewbacca leave in the Falcon, Rey taking the pilot\'s seat. They fly to the planet indicated by the map, where Rey carefully climbs a rocky island. When she reaches the top, she finds an old cloaked and bearded Jedi with a metal hand. It is Luke Skywalker. Rey wordlessly offers him the lightsaber.']"
7,Star Wars,The Last Jedi,2527336,"['I love the Star Wars franchise. I was so anxious to watch The Last Jedi especially how The Force Awakens ended and how good The Force Awakens was. I bought my tickets a month and a half in advance in anticipation of episode eight. As the movie started I was dialed in for the first 15 minutes then I noticed this subtle uneasiness in me like a disturbance in the force. It began with the interaction between Poe and Princess Leia. She made a comment and made a decision regarding Poe that I found a little unsettling. ""OK."" I thought. I didn\'t like that exchange but it\'s not a show stopper. The subtlety was that Leia was making it seem like the Rebels were in no need of heroes. They didn\'t need fighters anymore, they needed thinkers (or something akin to that). I took that little shift in philosophy in stride and kept eagerly watching. A couple of other small iniquities occurred but I soldiered forth watching with an open mind because it\'s ""Star Wars"".Then, there came the interaction between Rey and Luke Skywalker.Luke is part of movie folklore to me. Like many people have the one celebrity they\'d like to meet: the one fictional character for me has always been Luke Skywalker. Luke was the first hero I\'d seen wear black. He had piloting skills, light saber skills and could do Jedi mind tricks. He was the coolest.Fast forward nearly 40 years and now Luke is an old man. So what I\'m expecting is an older, WISER Luke. If Luke is on a deserted planet then it must be for a very good reason. And if Rey found him, much like Luke found Yoda, then Luke will have so much to impart upon Rey. That\'s not quite what went down. They made Luke a sullen pessimistic old man that was ignorant of simple truths. He offered so little; to the movie and to Rey. He was a shell of his former self, he was only good at being the ex machina. The Luke Skywalker in this movie was NOT the Luke Skywalker I knew. The Luke Skywalker I know was killed in this movie.After seeing my fictional hero relegated to something unrecognizable I actually became bitter while watching the movie. There was almost nothing they could do to save the movie. And they didn\'t . In fact, it got worse. By the end the movie was more of what I should have saw coming: rebels running from the Republic and figuring out some remote yet heroic way to ward them off. And what added to the annoyingness of this movie is that they didn\'t know when or how to end it. What should have been the end was followed up by another half an hour mini movie with its own beginning, middle and end.But unlike The Last Jedi I know how to end this post. Don\'t waste your time.', ""After George Lucas's execrable prequels and the mediocre The Force Awakens, I've learnt to keep my expectations low for any new Star Wars films in order to avoid total disappointment. Having just seen The Last Jedi, it appears that I haven't been keeping them low enough.The reasons for my loathing are the same as those noted in the countless scathing reviews here on IMDb, so I won't go into drawn out detail - suffice to say that the film frequently beggars belief, is massively bloated, defies logic and is full of misplaced humour (the worst moments being the horrible 'steam iron' gag and BB-8's handy coin launcher).3 out of 10, solely for the impressive special effects. Writer/director Rian Johnson shouldn't be allowed within 12 parsecs of another Star Wars sequel."", ""Picking up where The Force Awakens left off, Rey meets Luke Skywalker and tries to convince him to help The Resistance. He is initially hesitant but eventually decides to train Rey in the way of The Force. However, Kylo Ren also wants to track down Skywalker, and uses Rey for that purpose. Meanwhile, The Resistance are locked in deadly battle with the First Order and, while they have some minor victories, it seems like a futile struggle.I'm not generally a Star Wars fan but to my surprise I enjoyed Episode VII - The Force Awakens. It grabbed my attention from the word go and held it all the way through. A rollicking adventure with engaging characters. Moreover, the blending of the old characters and the new was very well done, with the feeling that the torch had been passed to the new generation.Unfortunately, Episode VIII doesn't come close to the engagement, novelty and adventure of Episode VII. Its essentially one long action-drama, with little in the way of engagement or originality. The Rey-Kylo Ren relationship had potential but went nowhere new or interesting and was snuffed out pretty quickly. Them possibly working together held my attention but the intrigue was short-lived. The movie simply degenerated into action sequences after that.On the upside, no need to waste my time on Episode IX (Or X, or XI, or...)..."", ""I didn't like Star Wars: The Last Jedi and I'm sorry. It seems as if the filmmakers were so focused on cool visuals and clever-sounding lines that everything else suffered. There are plot points that don't make sense, dramatic scenes which are undercut by out-of-place humor, and inconsistent characters. After the prequels, I felt like The Force Awakens was a step in the right direction, but this movie is a big stumble backwards."", 'If you sort these reviews by ""helpfulness"", you won\'t find a single review with a score of 7 or higher. Then how come this movie has an overall score of 7! Something isn\'t adding up.', 'Modern Disney - you know, the one that has to buy Pixar to gain any originality - has its fingerprints all over this one. There were great visuals, entertaining characters, and funny one-liners. Oh, and this one had inspirational messages: Anyone can be a hero, we fight out of love, failure is a teacher, etc. (however ham-fisted).The audience was there for the world-building and the advancement of the story. None of which really happened. So the audience focused on the string of plot holes, lapses in logic, and generally lack of anything new or interesting that was added to the Star Wars world. The Last Jedi is the cinematic reverse equivalent of fast food. Critics were more than happy with it because they came expecting a Transformers like CGI fest - they got that; the audience was expecting more. Plus after two movies we literally know nothing about Rey except that she is good at anything with little or no training. The only real spoiler I offer - given what happened on and off the set of the last two Star Wars films - is that the franchise is currently left in the same place as the British TV show Black Adder at the end of each season, minus Rowan Atkinson and the originality. I have to give it 4/10 stars just for the art design and technical expertise and nothing else. A big budget film like this could never be a 1 or a 2 out of ten. That\'s an Ed Wood film or ""Manos The Hands of Fate"" (don\'t ask). Likewise a 10/10 is Casablanca or The Godfather - when everything including acting, directing, depth of the plot and the ability to argue about themes, all come together such that the film still resonates years after it was made. This one made it about a third of the way between these two extremes.', 'I didn\'t hate TLJ, but even if I completely ignore all the (among many fans) controversial choices Rian Johnson made with regards to his treatement of Star Wars\' lore and characters, I still have a great number of qualms with the film in terms of its storytelling (sorry, this is going to be rather long):PACING: Now that was probably my biggest issue with the film. Apart from the opening battle, the film has very little forward momentum for nearly two thirds of its running time. After the action-heavy beginning, the plot gets tangled in 3 separate storylines which unfold simultaneously. My (perhaps personal) problem was that I found 2 of those neither emotionally involving nor thrilling: the Finn/Rose subplot about finding the code-breaker on the ""Casino Planet"" Canto Bight as well as the Poe/Holdo storyline about the resistance\' messy escape from the First Order and the universe\'s most sluggish space chase. But the one story I was ready to get fully invested in - you know: the one about Rey and Luke on the island (and Kylo via Force-Skype) - not only offers very little in terms of action and visual excitement, it also never really gets the time to breathe: because the overall narrative requires the film to cut back and forth between it and the other two evolving story threads.  The result of that narrative structure is 90 minutes of scenes with Rey and Luke (and a little Kylo) on a dreary, grey island that beg to resonate emotionally but get blunted each time by the film\'s need to cut to the (for me) somewhat uninvolving action in Finn\'s and Poe\'s part of the universe. And their two storylines lose all sense of urgency because they keep getting interrupted by the scenes on the island with Rey and Luke - which, to make matters worse, develop over several days in the film while Finn\'s and Poe\'s stories unfold over a couple of hours.Due to that uneven structure we end up with a two-and-a-half-hour movie where the most crucial scenes of the story never get enough room to breathe and even feel rushed. It\'s only once all three storylines start coming together during the last third of the film that the film\'s pacing really works for me. But getting there often feels like a chore (and I\'m really not sure a Star Wars film should feel like work).ODD CHARACTER CHOICES: What is the purpose of having Leia in a coma for the better part of the film? Don\'t tell me this is all set up so Kylo thinks she\'s dead: she\'s connected to the Force, and he\'s about as plugged into the Force as one can be; if established Star Wars lore tells us anything, it\'s that Kylo would instantly feel it if his mother died (now that\'s something even a casual fan such as myself knows). So why not use Leia more? Why introduce a completely new character in Laura Dern\'s Admiral Holdo, if she essentially just functions as a stand-in for Leia?Poe Dameron\'s whole arc in the film is about him learning the terrible human cost for stupid, vain heroism, and it\'s with Leia that he clashes, after he\'s sacrificed half the resistance\' fleet in order to take out a single Dreadnought during the film\'s opening battle. And as soon as Leia\'s in a coma, almost the exact same conflict continues with Holdo. Nothing against Admiral Holdo, but it\'s hard to get invested in her character, because we only just met her; from a storytelling point of view, to make Poe\'s arc really resonate and raise the stakes for him (and the audience), it would make much more sense if he rebelled against Leia. Wasting her in a coma instead seems utterly pointless.BIG MOMENTS: Unlike its immediate predecessor, TLJ shuns familiar formula. It\'s not all forward momentum, it\'s not all action - but unfortunately, it fails to provide the audience with an emotionally involving story instead. It may take characters in unexpected directions, but most of those new directions turn out to be somewhat... rather ""mature"" choices in terms of storytelling instead of exciting ones? Yes, there are several grand moments in the film that work great on an intellectual level, but they fail to reach us on a gut level. Whenever the film tries to build up to a big emotional moment, that moment ends up feeling, well, not very big at all - which naturally could again be a very deliberate choice by the director to subvert the formula, but to what end? Surely, the subversion itself can\'t be his main goal?For example, take the scene where Rey learns from Kylo that her parents were nobodies and that they\'re long dead. The problem of that scene is not the reveal itself: it\'s the scene\'s execution. It\'s a huge reveal for Rey, and it should have more weight. It could - and probably should - be the most emotional moment in the film; a heart-felt gut-punch to our heroine, but instead it\'s just: *fighting* - ""Your parents were nobodies, and they\'re dead."" - ""Yes, I feel it too."" - *fighting continues*. I just don\'t get why such an important moment is treated so fleetingly.In contrast, look how Lawrence Kasdan and J.J. Abrams staged The Force Awaken\'s most emotional scene: Han Solo\'s death at the hands of his own, terribly conflicted son. Now you can say about the film itself what you want, but that scene had a huge emotional impact on the viewer. It had weight. Imagine that scene had just happened during a fight, in a heated moment, only for the narrative to proceed without giving it any room? These are storytelling choices by Rian Johnson that don\'t do the movie any favors. I would have been ready to applaud the director\'s (and/or Disney\'s) decision to try something different after TFA, but I lament this failure to develop emotional gravitas - and the film\'s unwillingness to ever raise the stakes for its lead characters. Until the very end, I never feel like any of the protagonists are in real danger. Nor are they ever confronted with the shocking consequences of their reckless actions on a personal level; Finn and Poe\'s great ideas and plans directly lead to the senseless deaths of dozens, if not hundreds of people - but those casualties are just numbers; they\'re just exploding spaceships we witness from afar; our heroes (and we as an audience) are never forced to feel the full weight of their loss.As a consequence, there\'s just nothing there to make this war\'s terrible cost really resonate with us. This film needs a heartfelt punch to the gut; I\'m all for challenging the protagonists morally and give them intellectually satisfying arcs, but the resulting storylines should still be exciting enough to make your heart pound. And I know I can only speak for myself, but my heartbeat hardly ever accelerated throughout its entire two-and-a-half-hour running time - if at all.TLJ\'S ISSUES AS A DIRECT SEQUEL: TFA teased a boatload of things to come, and while I\'m theoretically on board with many of the unexpected directions Rian Johnson took these characters to in TLJ, I am very confused by his decision to ignore so many of the plot threads that were set up by Lawrence Kasdan and J.J. Abrams in TFA. Because due to that unorthodox approach, watching those two films back to back is a jarringly weird experience. Regardless how one feels about TFA, not even bothering to acknowledge what came before isn\'t just strange - it\'s almost offending to the many people who were fully invested in its mysteries and could hardly wait for those promised reveals.And don\'t tell me they have only themselves and J.J. Abrams to blame; no - they had every right to have those expectations: because TLJ IS the direct sequel to TFA. In the same sense that BACK TO THE FUTURE II was the direct sequel to BACK TO THE FUTURE: the kind of sequel that continues only seconds after the first film ends, resulting in one unbroken storyline developing over two films. And of course the director can go into unexpected directions in the sequel - hell: as an audience we want him to. In fact, that IS part of our expectation and one of the reasons we go to the movies (and BTTF II did it brilliantly) - but pretending like important plot points and huge moments in the previous film simply didn\'t matter or didn\'t even happen comes dangerously close to playing the audience for fools.Not that an artist (or a huge conglomerate) shouldn\'t have the creative licence to do that - but if you go down that road don\'t act surprised about the inevitable backlash. And I honestly don\'t get why going into new directions had to result in such an uneven transition from the first film to the second; the way I see it, even a couple of lines of dialog from characters like Luke, Snoke or Kylo-Ren would have been enough to tie some of the most prominent lose ends up or at least not just leave them dangling in the air like this. I mean, I get that Johnson doesn\'t want us to be interested in Snoke\'s story (and a whole bunch of other things that were made to feel important in TFA) because HE isn\'t interested in it. But as a writer he could get that point across and still address the issue (because the previous film told the audience to BE interested in it) - just to then quickly resolve it in an offhanded manner and take the story where he wants it to go.SUMMARY: The Last Jedi is a structurally uneven and often frustrating film that almost always refuses to give its heroes - and the audience - satisfaction. It is a film that over large stretches of its running time is so concerned with subverting the formula and teaching lessons about the importance of failure, that it fails to realize how watching your heroes fail over two and a half hours may be unexpected, but frankly - it\'s also a bit tiring.It may have been a gutsy and very unexpected move by Johnson to throw out most of the mysteries teased in TFA, but the question only audiences - and time - can answer is whether what he offers instead is a worthy replacement.Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/', 'When I watch this movie, it only makes me remember how good were all those other Star Wars movies and series before this one. They were great! But this one is a disaster.I am a Star Wars fans that has watched everything about Star Wars, including all animated series, movies, TV shows, video games, toys, non-canon legends, articles, everything. I can tell Star Wars is my favorite franchise to marathon.Last year I started my full marathon again, for 4th time, including all movies and series. The marathon is really long but hugely enjoyable at a level that no other can compete, until you get to this movie, The Last Jedi (2017).The Last Jedi (2017) screwed it all.Let me explain......If you are not a Star Wars fan, and you watch this movie alone (without marathon), you may like it. But when you are a Star Wars fan, you will feel severely disappointed, specially if you are marathoning.Where\'s the respect for the Star Wars fans?I blame it on only two persons: Rian Johnson (writer and director) and. Kathleen Kennedy (producer). You two screwed up what George Lucas took 40 years to build.It was much better with George Lucas. Oh! Way better!Why I blame it on Kathleen Kennedy? Because she is in charge now. If you choose someone to direct a Star Wars movie, make sure he or she is a Star Wars fan, because oh God! The Star Wars fanbase takes all this very seriously.I have some questions for you, Rian, and Kathleen. See below:* How Luke Skywalker gave up and abandoned his only family (his sister and friends) the republic, and all the causes for what he fought so hard and refused to help them? Did you even watched the original trilogy? Luke never give up. Please watch The Return of the Jedi, Rian.This ""Last Jedi"" Luke is not in line with the Luke from previous movies. And that\'s just NOT what a Jedi does.* If Luke didn\'t want to be found, how R2 D2 gave the missing part of the map? Can you explain?* How Rey, without any experience with the force, develops skills so perfectly and quickly in a way that an experienced Jedi or even a Sith has never done it?* What is that training from Luke?? Are you kidding me?? And how this training helped her in some way??* Where the hell the all-powerful Snoke came from?? He did showed up in Star Wars without any origin, background/story? Nothing?* How Leia survived that incredible SCAR explosion like in way that no a Jedi wouldn\'t have survived? Ok she is a Skywalker but, if she is so powerful, more than the Jedis (judging for the way she survived) why she didn\'t used those powers before to help a little bit? C\'mon!!! This doesn\'t makes sense!!* Why Finn and Rose rescue the space-horses but don\'t rescue the children?* And there\'s a lot more. I just don\'t have time to mention more than 30 errors found on this movie.If you are a Star Wars fan, you know what are all those errors.We, the Star Wars fans deserve more respect.I am going to marathon again, and I will skip this one and pretend this movie doesn\'t exists.The production design is good, the special effects are good, the acting is good, but the story is a joke. This screenplay is embarrassment for the Star Wars fans.', 'The Last Jedi is a weak eighth installment, lacking the magic of all those before.While ""The Force Awakens"" had mostly the same group of characters, I found them much more likable in that film, especially Rey. ""The Force Awakens"" had build up with introduction to the new characters and humour, here we are just chucked in and I can\'t recall laughing other than with Chewbacca and the porgs. Some of the intended humour was bad also, Domhnall Gleeson\'s character for one. Kylo Ren was terrible, but he was also terrible in the last film. Luke and Leia brought nothing to the table, only annoyance. Luke appeared to be drained after his hologram showdown with Kylo, why did he have a bloody sit-down with Leia first and also not discuss what he\'s doing. Then you have Snoke and his pointless involvement and silly death. Rey, the main character at this point, did nothing. So there\'s possible upside in that regard, but I am not looking forward to Episode IX. Oh and John Boyega stole that looking move from Cuba Gooding Jr, when he first meets Rose.', ""Horrible film. But it did do one thing for me. I turned me to never watching of following the film franchise ever again. I might watch some of the series with Boba Fett etc... but as far as the movies go.... Sad! My childhood growing up watching and loving these movies, and now I'm just stunned with how bad The Last Jedi was."", ""Absolute crap.Enough plot holes to sink the Titanic. Suspension of belief disrupted more than once. Characters act out of place and motives are just muddied.The movie tries to go too many directions at once and its overambition ruins it. Movie can't even be a standalone movie."", 'Wow this is getting hammered by reviews and now I understand why. Given its still in week 1 and most of the early reviews were all paid for and fake, the fact that this is at:57% - Rotten Tomatoes 50% - MetacriticMeans that the real scores are likely closer to 30% and 25% if you take out all the paid for ""pro"" and fake user reviews... Are they serious? Didnt they learn from the 1st one that they need to push the story forward instead of making a C grade retelling the old stories? Wow, so glad I didnt pay to watch this.1st of all, the replacement characters remain unlikable because dialog and character building is poor. Attempts at humor are not funny nor charming, and the plot development might as well be written by someone with a high school level intellect. Plot holes abound in what is sadly yet another attempt at a retelling of the same story from the 80s... how you can make more plot holes in a story remake? Well they did. and they threw in a few eye rolls as Rei continues to be a lore destroying super Jedi that has more power than all the previous Jedi combined without even trying and barely any training. The sensitive storm trooper who didnt want to kill can now kill all his brethren with a smile. And oh apparently the rebel are now so dumb that they dont even consider looking around for an exit when they are trapped, that is until the magnificent leader says they should look around and after asking Lea if its ok to look around with him... lol. Luke who is supposedly a master Jedi at this stage in his life, is now the guy who either died due to being out of shape or by a 3rd rate sith dork who lost to a storm trooper in melee combat. But he sure fooled him for a minute to allow a group of worthless idiots to escape... I guess this was his Obiwan moment when he went up against a full powered Darth Vader and had no chance of winning... except in Lukes case it was against a kitten with the IQ of a wet towel. They basically took a dump on all three original movies (and even the prequels if you care about those) as well as all the written lore that came after not to mention common sense. Luke got killed while projecting his hologram... why? To give the rebels time to escape when all they had to do was look around for an exit and shoot themselves out. But they were too dumb to figure that out. It took sacrificing Luke (who didnt actually need to die, he could have pulled out the second they started looking for an exit) and Rei to move a few rocks to do what would have been trivial with the guns and equipment the rebels had with them. And all this happened why? Because they ran out of gas lol.Good bye Star Wars.', 'Since Rise of Skywalker is coming soon, I\'d figure I\'d write this.What can I say about this movie that hasn\'t already been said? Here\'s all the legit problems that come up most.The comedy is horrible and forced. It\'s like discount MCU humor, and MCU humor isn\'t even that great to begin with. Typical random forced awkward slapstick comedy. Finn falling and water tubes squirting everywhere, WTF? They even try to insert their horrible comedy in serious scenes, taking away all the tension.Rey is bland, boring, has no character development, super powerful with little to no training or explanation. They had a chance to semi-explain her natural (God-like)talent, but they throw that out the window by saying her parents are nobodies. They could\'ve made up anything better to explain, like she has previous Jedi training yet mind was wiped, a clone, and/or she was related to a very talented Jedi or force user, etc. Literally anything would\'ve been more interesting that saying her parents are nobody. I get the writer and defenders of this trash movie saying, ""She\'s a nobody cuz that means anyone can be something. It\'s inspiring for normal people, derp derp!"" That\'s a cute cliche elementary school message, but it sucks, and executed so horribly in the movie. I\'ve seen PBS kids shows execute this cliche message a million times better than Last Jedi, because Rey does not earn her skill or power, which is NOT normal and not relatable at all.Also how does Kylo Ren know her parents are nobody, and why does Rey just believe him? WTF? A logical explanation I could come up with was Kylo was doing mind tricks on her, but Disney isn\'t smart enough to come up with stuff like that, and they can\'t dare show Rey get bested by anyone, because she\'s a Mary Sue. Cliche saying but it\'s true.It\'s already been said a million times, but Luke Skywalker is ruined. Look, I get we all have our moments of weakness. If I really reach, I can accept him trying to kill his newphew, despite her tried to save his father that\'s done way more evil stuff. What I can\'t accept is how he gives up and exiles himself for so long over this one little incident. Giving up is normal, but giving up for that long over something not that big is NOT normal, especially for Luke Skywalker. Multiple planets are destroyed by Kylo, Han Solo is killed by Kylo, the majority of the Resistance is killed, Leia is almost killed by Kylo, yet Luke still hides, WTF?The other characters are even more trash. Finn is super pointless, and partnered with another even more pointless diversity-for-hire character, Rose. Their entire sideplot is a huge chunk of the movie, yet completely pointless, and has pointless forced preachy real-life political messages that has nothing to do with the rest of the movie. The movie literally pauses just to lecture us on animal rights and capitalism. Obviously I\'m for animal rights, but that doesn\'t mean you should pointlessly shoe-horn it in any movie. Finn also repeats the same character arc of bravery he already did in Force Awakens, except executed way worse and cringe.Finn and Rose kiss scene on Crait is one of the worst scenes I\'ve ever seen in a movie in a very long time. She kisses him and does that stupid non-sense ""it\'s not about killing the ones we hate, but saving what we love"" line while the First Order laser is shooting to kill the Resistence. Finn was literally just about to save the ones he loved, so WTF? She puts the entire Resistance in danger over a cringe crush she has on Finn. If I was Finn, and she tried to kiss me, I\'d push her off me, slap her, and call her a ""selfish b*tch."" If Luke didn\'t show up, which no one knew was gonna happen, Rose would\'ve got the entire Resistance killed, just for some dumb zero-chemistry crush.Finn and Rose is probably the worst forced cringe ""romances"" I\'ve ever seen on the big screen, this even makes Anakin and Padme\'s romance in Attack of the Clones look good. Nothing they do in the Crait scenes makes sense. How do they not both die or seriously injured when Rose crashes into Finn\'s ship? Why doesn\'t the First Order kill them right there since they are now both completely exposed right in front of them? How does Finn manage to drag Rose all the way back to the bunker ON FOOT before the First Order, who has ships. WTF X 1000.There\'s also one more awful sideplot with Poe, where he mindlessly learns to obey authority without questioning it. It\'s just super dumb. Too many sideplots in this movie, and they all suck, along with the main plot.So then we get to the ending. The Resistance is all happy, which makes no sense since the vast majority of their group has just been massacred. They can literally fit their entire group on the Millennium Falcon. The ending should\'ve been somber like the ending of Empire Strikes Back.Just because it ""subverted expectations"" doesn\'t automatically mean it\'s good. Great writing/engaging plot, consistency, great character development, etc. all comes way before that, all of which this movies fails hard at. At least get those 3 things right before you can worry about subverting expectations and extra layers. Rian Johnson just comes off as an edgelord. He subverts expectations just for the sake of it, and it comes at the expense of any consistency within the story. Trust me, obviously I want originality and unpredictability in new Star Wars and in movies in general, but first and foremost, it has to actually be good and make sense. Just because you have a twist doesn\'t automatically mean it\'s a good twist. Rian Johnson is not a talented enough writer to make twist in a satisfying way while also still making sense within the overall story. It\'s everything ""I am your Father"" is not.I swear, I can\'t think of anything positive to say about this movie, aside from the visuals. Don\'t call me a Star Wars hater, because I\'m not. I wanted to love this movie so bad, but deep down, I just can\'t. I love Star Wars, even the prequels, I understand the prequels flaws, but they are still very entertaining to me with many amazing memorable scenes and quotes. Despite the prequels aren\'t perfect, you can tell there\'s heart and passion behind them. People still quoting the prequels, even the good quotes, because these movies were made with passion. No one quotes Disney Star Wars because there\'s no heart or passion going into them. It\'s just greedy corporate Disney shoe-horning their identify politics into it and milking the franchise for money, just like Luke milking that alien t*t, smh!Last Jedi probably is the most the most disappointing theatre experience of my life. I would never in a million years expect a Star Wars movie to be this bad. It\'s actually mind-blowing. I heard people say It gets better on multiple viewings, for me, it gets worse! I could barely finish it the second time because bit was SO BORING! This movie has zero rewatchability. No way I can watch that a third time. It seems some hardcore Star Trek fan wrote this movie in order to troll Star Wars and destroy it.Some say it\'s for kids, but this movie is insulting to even a kid\'s intelligence. I will never show my daughter this movie, she deserves better. I was a kid when I loved all 6 original Star Wars movies. I was in 4th grade when Revenge of the Sith hit theaters. Just cuz a movie is aimed at kid\'s doesn\'t excuse awful writing, cringe comedy, bad characters, etc. Kids shouldn\'t be treated like idiots either, they are growing. Movies like Toy Story are great for kid\'s, because it also has great writing. Even Mulan tells the tale of a strong brave woman a million times better than Force Awakens and Last Jedi, and without overcompensating. Besides, Star Wars is for the whole family in my opinion. But Last Jedi aren\'t for my kid, and obviously isn\'t for me.I\'m also not a straight White male, I\'m a straight Brown Mexican male, and I still hate forced diversity and identity politics shoved in movies. I hate how ignorant people call others ""racist, sexist, homophobic, etc."" for not liking this trash movie. I\'m none of those things. It\'s just a trash movie with trash writing, period. I don\'t care which race, gender, sexual orientation, etc. is involved. Rian Johnson is a straight White male and I think he sucks because he\'s writing sucks. People who say that need to come up with legit criticisms and arguments like a normal intelligent adult. I accept everyone has different opinions and won\'t insult you personally if you like Last Jedi. I\'m mature enough to accept everyone has different opinions, but you can\'t ignore the big objective flaws of this movie. And very rare people who claims to like The Last Jedi that I talked to never have any legit reasons on why they like it. They are generally only Far Left people, and/or hipster special snowflakes who go against the popular opinion just for the sake of it, just to feel special. If you truly want Star Wars to continue down this same path as Last Jedi, then wow! I have a very hard time believing you are serious, but I still respect your opinion despite I\'m highly against it.', 'Rian Johnson has made extremely poor choices with Luke Skywalker\'s character and many others. Also Rey learning to master the force in 10 seconds is completely ridiculous.. Not to forget about the purple hair lady telling her plan is ""HOPE"" to Poe which is completely dumb and makes Finn go waste some time on a casino planet to bring back an untrustworthy guy that will obviously sell himself to the highest bidder. Kylo Ren is still a crappy emo teen bad guy but now he has sexual tensions with Rey.. Finn chooses to save the resistance by sacrificing himself but his new girlfriend Rose decided to save him by crashing into him(alright this would make them both explode) saying ""WE NEED TOSAVE DA ONES WE LOVE"" while the resistance base is being blown up in the background because of her.. Then he drags her on foot all the way back from being right in front of the enemy to the base with 0 issues..', ""Its so bad it doesn't deserve a proper review. So i'll just list the problems with it.A) RoseB) assassination of one of the most iconic protagonist in history: luke skywalker.C) pink haired karenD) RoseE) snoke dies for no reason other than to catch us off guard. Was not thought out.F) rey is a mary sueG) kylo ren is childish and lame villain. Just has mood swings every 3 seconds.H) RoseI) RoseJ) Rose."", 'I can\'t really get into what\'s bad with this movie without dropping a ton of spoilers, but let me put it this way: a friend of mine went to see this before I did, and when I asked him how it was he hesitated, then said ""it\'s just a superhero series now"". He was more right than I ever could have known.The plot is stupid and is full of moments where my friends and I looked at each other and said ""wait, what?"". There are sequences in this movie that simply do not need to exist and provide literally nothing to the story. The technology, previously something I always thought was neat about Star Wars, is genuinely dumb and makes zero sense (why do big laser bolts in space arc like artillery?). I am ashamed to have paid money for this and as a long-time Star Wars fan it hurts to see just how dead the franchise I love really is. All that said, the special effects look and sound great, and it was fun to see Mark Hamill acting again. Other than that this movie is a disgrace not just to the franchise but to anyone with a brain. Stupid, stupid, stupid.', ""If The Force Awakens was a bit too adherent to the classic Star Wars formula, Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi is its equal and opposite reaction. JJ Abrams' effort often felt like a young boy putting on his Dad's coat, splashing on his cologne and trying in vain to mimic the old man's booming baritone voice. Rian Johnson's entry is the same kid a few years later, willfully eschewing everything that is his Father. The Last Jedi doesn't look like a Star Wars film. Hell, it rarely feels like a Star Wars film. Sure it's got familiar faces, space battles and Force mumbo jumbo, but this ain't your Father's Star Wars, and I think that's the point. The look and feel of this film is synergistic with its message. This is no longer Han, Luke and Leia's show. Perhaps more importantly, it's no longer George Lucas'. This is Star Wars: The Next Generation, and I don't like. Not at all.There are some truly great moments in the morass that is the painfully overlong The Last Jedi. Moments worthy of the saga that has been my constant companion since I first saw the original film as a wide eyed 3 year old in the late Summer of 1977. But these are few and fleeting, and no salve for the gapping wound it left in me. I realize now that for me, the Star Wars saga consists of three films. Star Wars (because for me it will always be Star Wars), The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. And I can even still enjoy the prequel trilogy despite glaring flaws, because at its core are the same basic fundamentals and the DNA of the same architect. What Disney and its minions have done is take someone else's toys and played the game their way. That's fine. But I don't have to watch."", 'My keenest memory of seeing this in the theater back in 2017 was during one of the ""Force skype"" scenes between Rey and Kylo. A kid in front of me leaned over to his father and asked in a tone of weary exasperation, ""Is the movie gonna be over soon?""That\'s THE LAST JEDI in a nutshell. Beyond the infuriating character assassination of Luke Skywalker, massive plot holes, the repetition of Finn\'s character arc from the first movie, the idiotic plot thread with Holdo and Poe,and Rey being perhaps one of the blandest, most overpowered leads in a blockbuster I have ever seen, this movie is boring. Two and a half hours of moping, psuedo-philosophy, and pretty pew-pew space battles that go nowhere.After seeing this movie in the theater, I tried to convince myself I was not disappointed. I tried to convince myself I enjoyed it, that it was deep, that I was somehow in the wrong for not enjoying a second of it. I read reviews. I read hot takes. Then after a long discussion with friends and some exposure to those who disliked the film, I finally accepted that I hated it and that it had killed any interest in seeing the rest of the Disney sequel trilogy.Judging from the synopsis of RISE OF SKYWALKER, I haven\'t missed a thing.', ""Honestly, as I was watching this all I could say that is was really, really boring. It simply seemed to drag on with little happening. Okay, I've probably earned the wrath of all the Star Wars fans out there, but honestly, I'm really starting to wonder whether this new trilogy is really all that worth it. In the end the film really seemed to be going nowhere, and simply had no purpose in it at all. In fact the entire storyline really could have been squeezed into the first third of a movie by simply cutting out all of the irrelevant stuff, and in my opinion there is quite a lot of it. Okay, there were some surprises, and it did end well, but having to sit through this film just to get to the end really wasn't worth it, and just to think that I have to go and see it again simply because my brother loves Star Wars. I'm not really all that sure if there is all that much I can say about it, other than it is basically the rebels attempting to escape from the First Order (read Empire). In fact that is basically the movie, which is why I found it so boring. They start off evacuating a base (aka Empire Strikes Back), and are then chased through intersellar space, before arriving at another planet where they attempt to fight off the First Order, fail, and manage to escape. Oh, and we also have Rey on the island with Luke attempting to convince him to come and help them with the fight against the First Order, while Luke is basically not wanting anything to do with anyone anymore. As a friend suggested, in the end it is the original characters that are the best, and this new lot are simply trying to take the shine away from what were some awesome characters. There is no way that BB8 can ever outshine R2D2, and the only reason I didn't give the film a lower score was because they still had R2 in the movie - and Chewie, who is also pretty awesome. But these new characters, I'm really not all that sure about them. Oh, and the whole idea of them travelling in lightspeed is absolutely ridiculous. Really, most people would know that in the grand scheme of things light speed is really, really slow, and that was something that really put me off the first movie. Surely the creators of this film were familiar with the originals, and would have known that they used the word 'hyperspace' instead of 'lightspeed'. Look, I'll probably end up going and seeing the next few movies, but I'm not all that impressed with where it is heading. Then again, I didn't actually mind the prequels (and I still consider C3P0 to be much more annoying that Jar-Jar Binks, but then again I'm not a huge fan of Jar-Jar either)."", ""I am sorry but I didn't like it.The story was boring, the dilemma nonsensical, the gender thing was overdone and that whole Melissa McCarthy and Fin romance thing was far-fetched. I was never a Melissa McCarthy fan and that Finn guy is completely rubbish too."", ""STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningFollowing on from the end of The Force Awakens, Rey (Daisy Ridley) has tracked down Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and seeks his training to become a great Jedi master. Meanwhile, the evil Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) is scolded for his failure to kill Rey and banished from active duty. Despite his apparent death at the end of the last film, Finn (John Boyega) has survived his encounter with Ren and becomes involved in a mission to sneak aboard a First Order ship and disable a vital component to bring it down.As well as being one of the most enduring franchises, Star Wars is also the one with the most distinctive fan base, the die hards who fill out the sci-fi conventions, and know every character, group and all the general titbits about it. Unless you are one of these dedicated, obsessive fans, which I cannot say I am, then it's just been overkill these last two years, with The Last Jedi marking the third SW related film in that space of time. In the end, I only went to see this one simply because there was nothing else on...and, this time round, I really did think that my time had been wasted.Knowing the loyalty of the fan base, the writers seem glumly aware that the characters (including Princess Leia, marking her final appearance after Carrie Fisher's death last year!) will sell the film more than any compelling story or well written script, and so we have all the main players from the last film in a continuation of events that serves no purpose in expanding the story in any meaningful way. But what's really shocking here is that even the special effects and battle sequences fail to produce any sense of genuine wonderment or spectacle, and leave you as cold and unimpressed as the writing. The majestic wonder of the first three, epic films, which is what flickered whatever faint interest I had in the series in the first place, feels sadly squandered and abused now. I think even hard core SW fans would have to agree that the franchise needs a rest, time to recharge its batteries, or maybe even just call it a day on the big screen and...maybe move to Netflix. **"", ""I watched this movie twice before finally making up my thoughts. The more i think about this one the more i felt empty and angry at the same time. You can enjoy this movie if you're simply want to see some space ships fighting, some aliens, thrown in, random politcal correct messages without any connection to the splot, some Marvell humor and no story telling at all.Of course there are quite a lot of bad movies out there, but nobody really cares about Transformers after watching the crap, right? This is different with Star Wars. This franchise connected so many people all over the world from all countries, ethnics, both male and female. What this movie does is to completely disconnect people and ruins almost everything Star Wars stands for. And in addition to this it also ruins it's legacy.I am not a hard core fan, i did not read any books or comics, just saw the movies. I did not really like the prequels, but at least George Lucas tried to tell an original story, but failed in execution. Episode 7 was okay as a reboot and Rogue One was my hope, that Star Wars can grow up into a great adult space epic, since although the story of R1 wasn't that good, the tone was excellent and catched everything i hoped for. Also the characters were believable if you consider the short screentime they had.In The Last Jedi it seems, that they tried to put everything into which needed to be in a commercial sci-fi kids movie, please some fans, include as much twists as possible just to the sake of surprise plus add the most obvious and cheap political correct statements possible. Yes, you can do that, but you need a really good plot, a vision and a perfect directing to match all these things together. And this is where you completely failed, Mr. Johnson.This movie is a desaster in story telling, pacing, tone, character development and also disrespectful to the legacy of Star Wars. It's an insult to both Star Wars fans and good movie makers in general.For me, this is the end of Star Wars. I wish this episode never happened and would be wiped out of the trilogies."", ""The New Order has the Republic, now the Rebellion, on the run. General Leia Organa's small resistance force has been discovered. Their only hope is Force-newbie Rey finding hermit-like Luke Skywalker and persuading him to pass on his Jedi knowledge to a new generation.I must start by saying that I hate togive spoilers, but it is difficult to assess this film fairly without doing so to some extent. The Force Awakens, episode VII, was a huge commercial success, but was - fairly - accused of revisiting the story from A New Hope. Does episode VIII avoid that accusation? Up to a point. You don't have to look too closely to see echoes of The Empire Strikes Back, though.The Force Awakens successfully passed the torch to a new generation, but left many unanswered questions. The Last Jedi opens with a terrific action set-piece - dammit, Poe IS a hotshot flyboy! - but then we want to have some questions answered. Who is Rey and why is she connected to the Force? Why did Kylo Ren turn rogue? Who is Snoke? How did his connection to the Force arise? Why does he have those hideous scars? How did he get his hooks into Ren? What does Finn do next? This film addresses NONE of these questions except in the most unsatisfactory way.It provides spectacular visuals which, of course, we expect. It gives us a host of cute aliens, robots, and tech generally. It gives us some humour. This is unusual for a Star Wars film. It would be welcome if it were not generally so misplaced. It does not help the film to have the evil General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) portrayed as a slapstick bumbling buffoon.The Last Jedi has two egregious faults. The first is narrative sloppiness. This is especially noticeable in the casino heist/Benicio del Toro sequence which is completely inconsequential and irrelevant. It should never have been part of the film. It goes nowhere, adds nothing and, with minimal rewriting, could have been cut. The film would still have run over two hours, but a good deal less than its bloated 153 minutes. The film is not well-paced.The second flaw is a wilful re-writing of Luke Skywalker's character. Luke has always been a hero, even when he was a callow, inexperienced youth. To revise him into someone who turns his back on doing the Right Thing, notwithstanding the provocation, is a betrayal of the audience. We have invested much in this character, over many years, and this is not playing fair with us.Oh, and while we're at it, John Boyega must be hugely disappointed: Finn was hardly in it.In short, the narrative does not flow well, the story is underwhelming, we don't get the answers we wanted to questions, and characters are inconsistent with earlier versions. And, as a result, The Last Jedi is a disappointment."", ""If someone told me I would have to watch this again or get punched in the groin, I'd simply request they use a boxing glove. That is all. But if they said no, I would still take the punch in the groin.The Asian Melissa McCarthy though."", ""If you like two no-talent hacks who should stay as far away from camera lenses as women in Georgia should stay away from McDonalds' drive-thru them this film is for you!First couple: is a almond e yed Lisa Mccarthy clone and a black guy who has as much acting talent as herSecond couple: a ADD toddler with bad teeth and his Mary Sue counter stalkerWhat does any of this have to do with Star Wars? You tell me!"", 'The opening crawl from this latest film \'Star Wars, Episode VIII: The Last Jedi\' reads that the First Order is plotting to seize military control of the galaxy. A team of Resistance fighters led by General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) are planning an evacuation from their main base as Supreme Leader Snoke\'s (Andy Serkis) forces are coming for them. The Resistance holds out hope that Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) will return to bring hope.The opening scene shows Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) and the droid BB-8 are flying over the First Order\'s dreadnought as General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) orders his men to fire upon Poe and the Resistance\'s base. Other fighters head in for the attack. Poe orders a fighter, Paige (Veronica Ngo), to drop the payload onto the dreadnought. The fighters take heavy hits, and Paige is knocked away from her remote. With mere moments before the First Order obliterates the Resistance, Paige is able to grab the remote and drop all their bombs down on the dreadnought, completely destroying it at the cost of her life. The rest of the fighters go into hyperspace to escape.Aboard the First Order ship, a hologram of Snoke reprimands Hux for failing to stop the evacuation. Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) enters the meeting. Snoke notes that, in spite of Kylo killing his father, Han Solo, he may still turn to the light side of the Force. Although Kylo protests, Snoke doesn\'t have faith in him. On his way down the elevator, Kylo smashes his helmet to pieces in rage.Meanwhile, former storm trooper Finn (John Boyega) wakes up from his coma after his light-saber battle with Kylo. Poe finds him and is happy to see him. The first thing Finn asks is for Rey (Daisy Ridley).Rey has just arrived on the planet Ahch-To with Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) and R2-D2 (Jimmy Vee) on the Millenium Falcon to find Luke. She hands him his light-saber, but he just callously tosses it over his shoulder. Confused, Rey follows Luke, but he doesn\'t want to see her or know who she is and why she has sought him out. She tells him that Leia sent her to find him. Chewie breaks down the door to Luke\'s hut. Luke then asks Chewie where Han is.Leia demotes Poe as a result of his actions with the dreadnought. Moments later, the First Order ship catches up to the Resistance after tracking their hyper-speed. The First Order deploys their TIE fighters to attack. Kylo flies in in his own TIE fighter and prepares to launch the killing strike against the Resistance leaders, but he pulls back after sensing Leia on board. The other TIE fighters fire upon them, causing a blast that sucks the rebel leaders into space to their deaths. Leia pulls herself back to the ship using the Force, but she goes unconscious.Rey and Kylo begin to feel a connection in which they can see and communicate with each other. With Luke still not wanting to have anything to do with the Force or the Jedi, R2 plays him Leia\'s original message to Obi-Wan Kenobi to persuade Luke to help (from the first Star Wars film \'A New Hope\'). Luke senses Rey\'s power and eventually agrees to give her lessons in the way of the Jedi and why it must end.With Leia out of commission, Vice Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern) assumes command of the Resistance. Meanwhile, Finn attempts to hop on an escape pod. He is found by mechanic Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran), who is mourning Paige, her sister. Rose is a big fan of Finn, seeing him as a Resistance hero. However, she zaps him with her taser when she realizes he\'s trying to escape. Finn notes that the First Order is tracking them through hyper-speed, and they can\'t make another jump because they are dangerously low on fuel, and the First Order will find them anyway. With Poe\'s help, they contact Maz Kanata (Lupita Nyong\'o) for assistance, but she is in the middle of a fierce battle. She does tell them that she knows a code-breaker on Canto Bight that can help them, and they need to find him wearing a particular symbol.Rey\'s first lesson sees Luke attempting to show her to feel the Force and control it. Rey is able to see visions and manipulate small pebbles as she achieves balance. However, she soon sees a vision of herself being pulled toward a dark pit, with Luke trying to break her out of it. The pit spews water and snaps Rey out of the vision. Luke says she saw the dark side of the Force, and she didn\'t even try to stop herself. He tells her he has seen something like this once before, and it didn\'t scare him then as it does now. This is why he considers the ways of the Jedi to be a failure.Finn, Rose, and BB-8 arrive at a casino on Canto Bight. Finn is impressed with the glitz and wealth of the casino, but Rose hates the place because only the weapons dealers who sell to the Empire are rich enough to gamble there. It is also home to a number of rotten people who take pleasure in misdeeds, including cruelty to giant but gentle creatures called fathiers that are forced to race, and enslaved children who live with them in the stables as caretakers. The trio finds the Master Codebreaker (Justin Theroux) playing at a table, but the heroes get captured and thrown into a jail cell for illegally parking their ship. In their cell, Finn and Rose meet a stuttering scoundrel named DJ (Benicio Del Toro). He overhears the two of them needing a code-breaker, and he offers his services. DJ manages to open their cell and helps them escape, and they climb down to the stable. Rose, fascinated by the beautiful fathiers, stops to free one from its stable and finds a small boy inside. Frightened, he nearly pushes a panic button but Rose shows him her ring with the Resistance\'s symbol. They fight guards on the way out with the help of BB-8 and ride the fathiers as they stampede through the casino to get away. Finn and Rose\'s ship is destroyed but BB-8 and DJ bring them another one to make their escape.Luke mentions that the last time he saw Kylo Ren as his student, he had attempted to kill him by collapsing his hut on him. As Rey and Kylo continue to connect, Kylo tells Rey that Luke saw the power growing in Kylo and had attempted to get rid of him before he got stronger.Holdo starts to set in motion plans to evacuate the Resistance ship to a nearby Resistance stronghold, the planet Crait. Poe believes she is doing something wrong, and he attempts to stage a mutiny. Before his plans can go into effect, Leia appears after waking up and she incapacitates Poe. Leia allows Holdo\'s plan to go ahead.Rey confronts Luke over what Kylo told him. They engage in a brief fight before she asks if he really tried to kill Kylo. Luke explains that he sensed nothing but great darkness in Kylo, with no hope of him turning back. He did consider killing him but backed out of it, only for Kylo to see him with the light-saber and respond with a counterattack. Rey decides to leave Ahch-To with Chewie and R2. Luke walks by the tree containing sacred Jedi texts when he is met by a familiar face...YODA (voice of Frank Oz). He destroys the tree with a lightning bolt, to Luke\'s dismay. Yoda\'s spirit tells Luke to help Rey before she is also lost to the dark side. Luke considers himself a failure, but, in the words of Yoda, ""The greatest teacher, failure is.""Meanwhile, Finn, Rose, and DJ make it to the First Order\'s ship. Unfortunately, they are captured by Captain Phasma (Gwendolyn Christie) and her goons, with DJ having told the villains Finn and Rose\'s plan in order to gain monetary compensation. At the same time, Rey arrives on the same ship and is taken prisoner by Kylo Ren.Kylo brings Rey to Snoke. Rey tries to get Kylo to abandon the dark side, but Snoke taunts Rey as she tries to fight back. Snoke reveals that he created the connection between her and Kylo in an attempt to destroy Luke. Snoke attempts to get Kylo to kill Rey with his light-saber, but Kylo uses Luke\'s light-saber to impale Snoke and cut him in half. Rey and Kylo then fight Snoke\'s soldiers and slaughter them all. Kylo, now fully taken over by the dark side, tries to get Rey to join him, but she refuses and tries to get him on the Resistance side. Kylo attempts to manipulate Rey when mentioning her parents. Despite her trying to forget, her parents were just junk traders who sold her off. Rey eventually resists and leaves to rejoin the Resistance while Kylo assumes his role as the new Supreme Leader.As the Resistance fighters are making their way to Crait, Hux\'s men start to fire upon the transports, killing heavy numbers of the Resistance. Seeing no other option, Holdo sacrifices herself and rams the command ship at light-speed into the First Order ship, splitting it in two and destroying other nearby ships.BB-8, having escaped the villains\' clutches, commandeers a AT-AT armored Walker to fire upon the First Order soldiers. Finn and Rose prepare to escape, but Finn battles Phasma until he overpowers her. She tells him he was always scum, to which he proudly responds, ""Rebel scum."" The ship starts to come apart, and Phasma falls into the burning wreckage. Finn and Rose head off to meet the others on Crait.The surviving Resistance fighters have dwindled to a few dozen or so. Kylo and Hux lead gigantic walkers to the Resistance stronghold, armed with a battering ram cannon that will obliterate the entrance. Poe leads Finn, Rose, and a few others on speeders to fight back. Rey and Chewie come down with the Falcon to draw away TIE fighters while Finn attempts to stop the cannon. He nearly flies head on until Rose crashes her ship into his to stop him. Finn goes to her and asks why she did it. She tells him they always fight for what they love. She kisses him and then passes out. Finn rushes back to the stronghold to get Rose medical attention.The First Order fires their cannon onto the stronghold. Poe and Leia appear hopeless with most of their comrades dead and their own doom approaching. Suddenly, Leia is visited by Luke. The two siblings have a final meeting, with Luke saying that ""Nobody is ever truly gone."" Luke goes out to face the First Order. Kylo orders the soldiers to fire everything on Luke where he stands. Even after the insane amount of firepower unleashed on Luke, he still stands and coolly brushes his shoulder off. Poe realizes Luke is distracting the villains to allow them to escape. The fighters follow crystal wolves to an exit, only to be blocked by a huge pile of rocks.Kylo goes down to face Luke himself. They duel with their light-sabers, and Kylo attempts to strike Luke with a killing blow, only to realize Luke is a hologram... projecting himself while still on Ahch-To. Luke tells Kylo that he will not be the last Jedi. At that moment, Rey uses the Force to clear the way for the fighters. She and Finn embrace. Kylo screams in rage at his defeat as the heroes board the Falcon and escape.On Ahch-To, Luke finishes using what power he had left. He looks up and sees a twin sunset, just like back on Tatooine. He smiles, and then, he vanishes, now completely becoming one with the Force. Rey tells Leia that she has sensed that Luke is now gone, and she asks what will become of the Resistance now. Leia tells her they have what they need to rebuild.On Canto Bight, a trio of stable children that previously encountered Finn and Rose are telling each other the story of Luke Skywalker. Their master comes over to scold them to force them back to work. The boy they had found in the stable goes outside to sweep. He looks up at the sky to see the Falcon flying overhead, and, with Rose\'s Resistance ring on his finger, he raises his broom like a light-saber.The film closes with the words, ""In loving memory of our princess, Carrie Fisher.""']"
8,Star Wars,The Rise of Skywalker,2527338,"['I went to see this new Star Wars movie tonight--a few weeks after it opened to tepid reviews. Well, after seeing it I can understand some of the lack of enthusiasm for ""The Rise of Skywalker"", as it suffers from a HUGE problem...I felt pretty much indifferent to it. I would have preferred it if the movie has really sucked...then I would have had fun laughing at it.I won\'t recount the plot here...mostly because the film was non-stop and most plot elements lasted mere minutes. The folks went from one deadly fight to another to another to another...and much of the first portion of the film turned out to be unnecessary.I am NOT a \'Comicbook Guy\' who complains that the film isn\'t true to the original three or other such nonsense. I have gone to all the films and enjoyed them (with the exception of ""Episode 3""...but few enjoyed that movie)...and I really enjoyed some of the more recent ones. But I disliked much of ""Episode IX"" because it seems like J.J. Abrams is trying to undo so much of what Rian Johnson did in ""Episode VIII"". Sad...but I liked ""Episode VIII"". Instead of relationships and characters, ""Episode IX"" is pretty much only about explosions, near misses and more explosions....as well as long dead characters suddenly coming back to life for no good reason.All in all, a joyless mass of explosions and a film I should have just skipped. The theater also was showing ""Knives Out"" (By Johnson) and that film was FUN. ""Star Wars: Episode IX"" is simply un-fun.', 'Saw \'The Rise of Skywalker\' just before Christmas with my sister, but it took me a while to gather my thoughts on it. Being not sure what rating to give it or how to express my opinion on the film. Will admit that when seeing it in the cinema, to me it was enjoyable but had a lot of faults. Since watching \'The Rise of Skywalker\' then though, the more it has been thought about the more it has gone down in my estimations. My reservations felt back then still remain the same, as well as what struck me was good, while thinking of more since.My opinions on the previous \'Stars Wars\' films were much more definite, being a fan of the original trilogy and while the prequel trilogy had a lot of flaws to me they weren\'t that bad. Also thought \'The Force Awakens\' and \'The Last Jedi\' were better than expected (am aware that possible blasphemy has been committed here), but \'The Last Jedi\' certainly had a lot wrong with it. \'Solo\' was good fun on its own terms too. Absolutely judging it from an open mind, \'The Rise of Skywalker\' left me very conflicted however and ended the trilogy on a whimper rather than a bang, it\'s not deserving of a 1/10 but it is not near deserving in my opinions of the 10/10s mostly given to counter the negativity in classic critic bashing style. Of the franchise, this was the one in all honesty that left me the most disappointed.Will start with the good things with \'The Rise of Skywalker\'. It is gorgeously shot and designed and the special effects are often a marvel. John Williams delivers yet another rousing score that has its own character but cleverly includes the well-known iconic themes from the previous films.There are some great performances here, Daisy Ridley carries the film outstandingly, having become more confident with each film, and Adam Driver is menacing and conflicted. Carrie Fisher again brings nostalgic poignancy to Leia, while John Boyega and Oscar Isaac are charismatic and do their best with what they were given (which was quite weak in my view) and how great it was to see Ian McDiarmid again as Palpatine, again his material was not great but he does a good job with it. Chewbacca is as adorable and funny as ever and C-3PO provided a few amusing moments. Babu Frik was a nice new addition and there were a couple of touching and nostalgic moments. Some of the action is thrilling, namely the extended blaster battle and Rey and Kylo\'s force-based clash.For all those good things, \'The Rise of Skywalker\' has a lot of major flaws. With so little time to breathe in the story, the film feels far too rushed which made it very difficult to digest the more convoluted parts of the story. There is also too much going on so the film feels very cramped by the final act, and also too many characters. Some are fun but too many of them are underused or even pointless and tacked on, such as Lando and Rose Tico. Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford only seemed to be there for nostalgia purposes and are merely walk-ons.Although the action has its moments, too much of it doesn\'t rouse like it should do and is in a way forgettable. The big reveal that has been much discussed here made absolutely no sense (the atmosphere felt at that part in the packed auditorium in the cinema was like a uniform ""what the heck?"") and really convoluted the storytelling later on, leading to a conclusion that felt rather too anti-climactic and made a waste of the characters involved in it. A long way from a bang. Morever, the dialogue is as bad and even downright laughable than the worst of the prequel trilogy\'s with far too much exposition and unrealistic conveniences.Overall, have seen far worse but a big disappointment. If some people liked it, good for you. It just didn\'t work for me and many others, for reasons that are valid, and it is inexplicable as to why people have an inability to accept that, and not just for this film but for almost every film here. 5/10', ""The Empire is in chaos. There is a pretender on the throne. A new rebellion is banished to the Outer Rim. The Empire is re-establishing control with yet another Order. At least, it's not another Death Star. It's Disney Plus spaceships with guns. The Mouse Empire muddles on. The new trilogy is simply not planned out. That is its major flaw above all else. This final chapter tries to take back a few story elements and wrap up the story with a bow. It is not to be dissected for plot holes or logic flaws. It rushes to push the franchise across the finish line. It works to some extend and it doesn't cause any more major troubles. Most fans would probably be satisfied with reaching the finish line and not having any more movies for awhile.Nobody is a somebody. A shocking reveal happens and it barely clears the bar. There are plenty of problems and an Orphan Black situation. Like many elements in this movie, one should not think too hard about it. Remember Tom Cruise's War of the Worlds. This one does something even crazier with its spaceships. This is the stupidest part of the plot but let's roll our eyes and move on. The plot is basically getting the MacGuffin to get another MacGuffin. The film is running on double time and the speed seems to be used to hide from story questions. Everybody is rushing. History is being revised. No one is throwing away a light saber in this one. Finn never actually say the thing to Rey. It is emotionally safe. I thought they would keep Carrie Fisher in the first act but they dragged her out there for too long. I won't say that it's disrespectful but it is a little awkward. Overall, this one tries to quickly wrap up the story in a fan friendly way and the last person turns out the lights."", ""I thought the The Rise of Skywalker made a fitting end of Disney's Star Wars trilogy. It marks the end of the original characters, Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia and Han Solo.It also deals with Rey's story and that of Kylo Ren. Destiny and redemption.The evil empire is not quite finished nor are the Sith. Kylo Ren aims to mimic his grandfather and discovers that Palpatine was always in control.Rey and the rebels search for the planet where Palpatine is hiding. It will bring Rey into conflict with Kylo Ren and she will find her true heritage.Although 20 minutes too long, this one is aimed at fans. Well fans who do not use terms like 'Mary Sue' or 'Woke.' Just imagine if there were internet forums back in 1980 when The Empire Strikes Back was released. Hold on what's a black man doing there?There are nods to the past, Lando Calrissian returns, Wedge Antilles flies by. You can even spot Ewoks.There were also poignant moments, Chewbacca's reaction to the death of Leia was rather emotional. Knowing this is likely to be the last time we shall see Hamill and Ford in a Star Wars movie. I am sure there would be more Star Wars movies in the future but this is an end of an era."", ""It has been quite some time since I got excited about this franchise; I guess the TV shows maybe are doing more at the minute, but for the films there is little to get excited about within them, and probably far too many of them being made for all the 'proper' fan to make it a date. Rise of Skywalker had been largely panned by viewers and critics, but I decided it was a good Friday night sort of film - one that doesn't take too much effort to watch. I was correct because this film really doesn't have much of a plot to care about, and seems to have been patched together without a lot of thought to the whole.Technically it is very impressive - although of course it is because hundreds of millions of pounds were spent to make it sound and look good; and it mostly does. If you want lightsabers and space battles then you get it here. However if you put aside the technical feat, it is very much hollow. I struggled to care about anyone in the film; the dialogue was often clunky, and there was almost nothing natural or organic in there. The writing doesn't help itself by doing things that seem fan-service at best, and cynical at worst. For example the constant references back to other films by having scenes that echo scenes in the original films break things up. Meanwhile moments or aspects are included that don't seem to mean much in the moment and feel like they have been included in the hope of linking to yet another spinoff opportunity. With all this, the cast are mostly stuck with just going with it the best they can but nobody really stands out as an actor.In the end, it is a fairly bland product; full of noise and spectacle but nothing of any real grit, interest, or substance."", ""The battle continues. We discover Rey's heritage and I admit I was wrong about Obi-Wan. We quickly find out the Emperor and Ian McDiarmid are still alive and control little Darth as they go on planet destruction. Past characters are brought into the feature, both living and dead. Thank you for not reviving Jar Jar Binks. There is plenty of action and Rey is seemingly placed in a no-win situation. Billy Dee Williams makes a surprise return, as does Mr. Ford.There were unexpected things, but when they did happen it felt cliche and expected. I liked the campfire ending in episode 6 better than this one. Disney leaves open a possible sequel 20 years from now when Rey has twins, one good and one evil. Yes, worth watching on the large screen, but what Star Wars wasn't? Okay, there were a few."", ""I know that many have waited for this. And I can tell you they were way more excited than I was. I have watched the Star Wars movies and I am not as big a fan as many of them are. I don't dislike the movies or the franchise. I just never was as big a fan as many were. One of the reasons is, I never had the experience as a kid. So while I totally get what some feel about them, and I respect that, I hope the same is attributed to me and my views.Having said all that, the movie is what one should and could expect. With some twists that may not make much sense, but get the thing to the intended ending everyone was ... well at list wishing for. Not exactly as it happens here of course, but still. You can't make everyone happy, that is just not possible. So this is either religion for you or just plain fun for a couple of hours. The director tried his best to please as many people as possible, which might not be necessarily a good thing ... but there you go"", ""Much like the episodes 'The Force Awakens' and 'The Last Jedi', I'm left with sort of a ho-hum feeling about this last picture in the Star Wars franchise. It's certainly got it's share of now familiar characters and monumental action scenes, but somehow it didn't seem enough. It felt like the film makers tried to cram in as much story as possible into the picture, but in so doing gave us some confusing scenarios that don't gel very well with the past. The return of Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) is one example, and that was a pretty major one. Internal consistency is also a problem, when someone like Rey (Daisy Ridley) can maintain an epic power struggle with Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) over the escaping air ship, but then has to exert herself climbing a rock face later in the picture. Why rely on human strength when you have all this mystical ability at your command? I did like the nods to the original players in the Star Wars saga, as the writers found a way to bring back Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, Leia Organa and Lando Calrissian. That was essentially a given knowing that the nine part series had now reached it's finale, and that sort of tribute was well deserved. As one who's been around as long as the franchise, I'm pretty much happy and satisfied that the story has run it's course fulfilling George Lucas's original mission. But if you want the real magic you have to go back to 'A New Hope' and relive how it all began."", ""The apparent end of the Star Wars franchise was what I expected. I don't see how they would expand the franchise beyond here, and I hope that they don't. Carrie Fisher deserves to rest in peace.Although I gotta admit that it was interesting looking at the cast and noticing that it includes Lin-Manuel Miranda as well as George Harrison's son Dhani."", 'Disney acquiring Lucasfilm was a great decision, the first of the new space saga sequel movies The Force Awakens was brilliant, and the second film The Last Jedi was also fantastic, and after 42 years since the release of the original Star Wars, this was the final film of the franchise, directed by J. J. Abrams (Lost, Mission: Impossible III, Star Trek, Super 8). Basically, a threat of revenge has been received from Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), assumed to be dead years ago. Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), having obtained a Sith wayfinder device on the planet Mustafar, finds the Emperor on the uncharted planet Exegol. The Emperor reveals that he created Snoke as a puppet to control the First Order and lure Kylo to the Dark Side. Palpatine then releases a secret fleet of Star Destroyers and tells Kylo to find and kill Rey (Daisy Ridley), who is continuing her Jedi training, with the help of Resistance leader General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher). A spy within the First Order has delivered information, which Finn (John Boyega) and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) say reveals Palpatine\'s location on Exegol. Rey meanwhile learns from notes left by Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) about a Sith wayfinder can lead them there. Rey, Finn, Poe, Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo), BB-8, and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) depart in the Millennium Falcon for the planet Pasana to find an ally as recommended by Leia. There, they find Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), who points them in the direction of the wayfinder\'s last suspected location. Kylo learns where Rey is through their Force bond and travels there with his warrior subordinates, the Knights of Ren. Rey and the others discover the remains of the assassin Ochi of Bestoon (Liam Cook), his ship and droid, and a dagger inscribed with Sith text, which C-3PO\'s programming forbids him from translating. The First Order captures the Falcon, Chewbacca, and the dagger. Rey tries to save Chewbacca, but accidentally destroys a First Order transport with Force lightning. The group escape in Ochi\'s ship, assuming that Chewbacca is dead. Poe suggests traveling to Kijimi to have the Sith text extracted from C-3PO\'s memory. C-3Po\'s memory is wiped in the process, but coordinates reveal that a wayfinder is on Kef Bir. Rey senses that Chewbacca is alive, and the group mounts a rescue mission. While Kylo searches for Rey, the group infiltrates his Star Destroyer with the help of Zorii Bliss (Keri Russell), an old acquaintance of Poe\'s. Rey recovers the dagger and has visions of her mother (Jodie Comer) and father (Billy Howle) being killed with it. Kylo informs her that she is Palpatine\'s granddaughter; he reveals that Ochi was ordered by the Sith lord to recover Rey as a child, but she was hidden by her parents for her protection on Jakku. General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) saves Poe, Finn, and Chewbacca from execution, revealing himself to be the spy. He lets them escape on the Falcon but is executed by General Pryde (Richard E. Grant) for treason. The group arrives on Kef Bir. Resistance sympathiser Jannah (Naomi Ackie) leads them to the remains of the second Death Star, where the wayfinder is located. Finn is surprised to find out that, like himself, Jannah is also a former stormtrooper, and was one of many deserters. Kylo tracks them down, destroys Rey\'s wayfinder and asks her to join him to go against Palpatine. Leia is dying, before passing away she calls to Kylo through the Force, distracting him as he duels with Rey, who impales him. Sensing Leia\'s death, Rey heals Kylo using the Force and takes his ship. She returns to Ahch-To, where the Force spirit of Luke encourages Rey to face Palpatine and gives her Leia\'s lightsaber. Rey uses the wayfinder in Kylo\'s ship to make her way to Exegol. After healing, Kylo talks to the spirit of his father, Han Solo (Harrison Ford), after which he throws away his lightsaber and reclaims his identity as Ben Solo. The Resistance then see the planet Kijimi obliterated by a Star Destroyer equipped with a super laser. At the Resistance base, R2-D2 (Hassan Taj and Lee Towersey) restores C-3PO\'s memory upon the group\'s return. The Resistance follows Rey\'s coordinates to Exegol, where she confronts Palpatine. The Emperor wants her to kill him, being his relative he wants to transfer his spirit into her body. Lando brings reinforcements from across the galaxy to join the battle against Palapatine\'s army, the Last Order. Ben overpowers the Knights of Ren and joins Rey. Palpatine drains the pair\'s power to rejuvenate himself. He attacks the Resistance fleet with Force lightning and incapacitates Ben. Rey is weakened, she hears the voices of past Jedi, who lend her their strength. Ben revives Rey by transferring his life force into her; they kiss and Ben dies, becoming one with the Force, along with the body of his mother Leia. The remainder of Palpatine\'s armada are successful destroyed by the Resistance. As the Resistance celebrates, Rey visits the abandoned home of Luke Skywalker on Tatooine. She buries the Skywalker lightsabers, having built her own. A passerby asks her name; she replies, ""Rey Skywalker"". Also starring Kelly Marie Tran as Rose Tico, composer John Williams as Oma Tres and Mary Poppins Returns\' Lin-Manuel Miranda as a Soldier, with the voices of James Earl Jones as Darth Vader, Andy Serkis as Snoke, Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker, Samuel L. Jackson as Mace Windu, Ewan McGregor as the younger Obi Wan Kenobi, Sir Alec Guinness as the older Obi Wan Kenobi, Frank Oz as Yoda, Freddie Prinze Jr. As Kannan Jarus and Liam Neeson as Qui-Gon Jinn. The appearances of Hamill, Ford and Fisher (through unused footage from The Force Awakens) are good, Boyega and Isaac are great as the heroes, and McDiarmid returning as the sinister Emperor is welcome, but I agree with critics that this film pretty much belongs to Ridley and Driver, delivering the key moments that will bring the show to a close. I will be honest and say that this finale to the saga is almost the same quality as Return of the Jedi, very enjoyable, but just that tiny something missing, perhaps it is lacking a little emotionally. However, you cannot ignore the spectacular battle sequences, the brilliant special effects and the well-paced action, all together it is a terrific worthwhile science-fiction fantasy action adventure. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Original Score for John Williams, Best Visual Effects, and Best Sound Editing, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Original Music, Best Sound, and Best Special Visual Effects. Star Wars was number 24 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Very good!', ""As this, the ninth and final chapter in the Skywalker Saga opens Kylo Ren makes his way to the planet Exegol where he finds Emperor Palpatine. He is ordered to find and kill Rey. Meanwhile a spy aboard the First Order fleet passes on a message warning that the Emperor is back and is will destroy any world that doesn't surrender. Rey, Finn, Poe Dameron and others must find a way to get to Exegol and stop the Emperor before it is too late. Inevitably this won't be easy and they will have to visit new worlds, face threats both new and old and make new friends.When I first watched 'Star Wars' it was in the cinema when I was ten years old in 1977 and I, like all my friends, was awestruck. All these years later I may not be quite as awestruck watching this on DVD but I still really enjoyed it. The story provides lots of excitement and characters I care about; some like Rey and Finn first appeared in this trilogy, others like Leah and Luke have been there from the start. I wasn't expecting any real surprises but one was delivered... which I won't spoil here. There were also some genuinely emotional moments. The cast does a fine job; I particularly liked Daisy Ridley's performance as Rey. It was a treat to see many of the cast of the original films returning; it was especially poignant to see Carrie Fisher's final performance. As one would expect the special effects were top notch. I know a lot of people were disappointed but I really liked it and would say it is a must see for Star Wars fans... love it or loathe it; decide for yourself."", 'Right, well I am an avid fan of ""Star Wars"", and have been ever since I was introduced to ""Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope"" back in the 1980s some time. And yes, the expectations were great for this movie to bring to closure the Skywalker saga.While I am by no means a particular fan of director J.J. Abrams and his lense flares, then this movie was one that needed to be seen in the cinema. It is a ""Star Wars"" movie after all. And yeah, it definitely got a lot of grief from the elitist former ""Star Wars"" fans that were angered by their fandom not being served in the manner they wanted and expected with the previous movies. But still, to me, those fanboys\' opinions hardly matter. If you dislike something, leave it alone and move along - this isn\'t the movie you\'re looking for!With pretty high expectations I went to watch ""Star Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker"" and I must admit that when I left the cinema, it was with a very overwhelming sense of a proper closure to this part of the ""Star Wars"" saga. This movie definitely worked for me, and it brought together a lot of ends and managed to wrap it up quite nicely in a manner that was more than satisfactory to me.""Star Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker"" definitely feels and looks like a ""Star Wars"" movie should, from start to end. Lots of action, character driven story and lots of attention to the ""Star Wars"" galaxy in greater and smaller detail.I am not going to delve into the storyline, but I was impressed and I was entertained. Boy, how I was entertained. There were a lot of grand moments throughout the course of this last chapter in the Skywalker saga. The return of some iconic heroes and villains, which definitely worked out so well for me and it was a nice way of wrapping things up with these characters.It should be said that the movie had me dangerously close to shedding a tear two or three times, because of my affection for the ""Star Wars"" universe and the connection that there is to the characters that I grew up with, admiring, wanting to be, playing with by the Kenner action figures, and so forth.Of the last three chapters in the Skywalker saga, then ""Star Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker"" is miles ahead of parts VII and VIII, both in terms of story, action and entertainment.I am rating ""Star Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker"" a solid nine out of ten stars, as this is very close to being as good as the original trilogy - that being parts IV, V and VI. This is well worth taking the time to sit down and watch, more than once even. Watch it for the story the first time, then watch it for all the little details and such the next time.', ""After the debacle that was The Last Jedi, I (and many other lifelong Star Wars fans) had hoped that lessons would have been learned at the House of Mouse, and that the final film in Lucas's proposed nine-movie saga would end the franchise on a high. Sadly, this is not the case.J.J. Abrams, who also directed the fair-to-middling Episode VI: The Force Awakens, gives us another visually impressive movie full of breathtaking worlds and amazing creatures, but his film suffers from a mediocre plot full of elements that make very little sense and which will annoy the hell out of Star Wars purists.The basic storyline sees Rey (Daisy Ridley) and her rebel pals trying to find where the evil First Order are gathering their forces, so they can launch a final assault and end the tyranny of Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) once and for all. Along the way, Chewie (now played by Joonas Suotamo) is taken hostage, C3-PO (Anthony Daniels) gets his memory wiped, and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) realises that, hey, perhaps being bad isn't for him after all.The whole thing rushes clumsily from one scenario to another with little care for logic, the makers clearly hoping that the dazzling on-screen spectacle will distract the viewer from the fact that nothing here is all that original, and that the narrative is choppy and often confusing, with many contrived moments that are there purely to further the plot, or to retroactively explain away mistakes in the previous movies.My biggest gripe is the scene in which Rey crosses a stormy sea (very impressive digital effects) to the wreckage of the death star. That's right... either the same death star that was blown into a gazillion atoms by Luke Skwalker in A New Hope (or perhaps the second one in ROTJ, also obliterated). Somehow, this massive chunk of debris crashed onto a planet and just happens to hold the artefact required to guide the rebels to the enemy. Talk about convenient. The most pointless scene is an Androcles-inspired encounter with a subterranean serpent. And the most blatant act of back-pedalling comes in a short scene that shows Leia training as a Jedi, so as to excuse her sudden 'space flying' ability in The Last Jedi.Of the bits that actually work, a chase scene involving our heroes on speeders and stormtroopers on caterpillar-tread bikes is exhilarating, a Pasaana festival (celebrated every 42 years! Geddit?) features some wonderful dancing Cthulu-like aliens, there's a cute Anzellan droidsmith called Babu Frik who guarantees a few giggles, Richard E. Grant makes for a nice new villain, and the physical psychic connection between Ren and Rey adds a new twist to the power of the force.Unfortunately, as someone who has been there from the start (I was 9 when Star Wars came out in '77), I cannot help but find Episode IX a disappointment. It's not quite as bad as The Last Jedi or Attack of the Clones (both 3/10 from me), but it's not the rousing finale that we have all been waiting for. Average just isn't good enough."", 'Three movies in to the final part of what is being called the Skywalker Saga and I have to confess: worse than not knowing anything about these new characters -- Poe Dameron, Finn and Rey -- I honestly don\'t care about them. They\'re ciphers that we only know the barest of things about. Why does Finn have such an affinity for his friends? Why should we care a lick about Poe when he\'s proven to be too headstrong and willing to leave people behind, yet has nothing redeeming to make up for it? And Rey has every single skill of the Jedi near-instantly, almost a way too perfect character to be true.Don\'t tell me I have to read the other books or watch the shows or do my research. Don\'t tell me that the old films in the Star Wars saga didn\'t come out as often or perhaps we cared too much about them. I sat -- well, slept, I\'ll be perfectly honest -- through this too loud and too much installment and I have to tell you my most honest review: Yeah, alright.I don\'t go to blockbusters to walk away saying, ""Yeah, alright.""SPOILER WARNINGObviously, everything after this will contain massive spoilers. You have been warned.The first critical error the film makes is by telling us that a secret message has caused a stir in the galaxy: the Emperor is alive. You know, instead of a scroll, perhaps this event -- probably the most important thing that\'s happened in all three of these post Return of the Jedi films, could have been shown to us so we could grasp just how mindblowing it is. Nope. It\'s in words on the screen. The dead speak! This is lazy filmmaking.Kylo Ren (Adam Driver, who isn\'t howling in a bar or eating ass in this one) obtains a Sith Wayfinder device and travels to the planet Exegol, where the Emperor is recharging. It turns out that everything evil in the past few films has come from Palpatine, including Snoke who is just a clone. Snoke is the most infuriating character in these films, another character who really has no motivation and no reason to exist other than being yet another Star Wars villain set up to be an undefeatable villain only to, you know, by cut in half. See: Darth Maul, General Grievous, Count Dooku.So the Emperor does what has never been done before. He just plain conjures up a million or so Star Destroyers on a planet that has constant darkness and lightning. He tells Kylo to find Rey, who is studying to be a Jedi with General Leia Organa Solo (Carrie Fisher), who is more Force-sensitive than a Jedi, you know, until this movie, which has a CGI cut scene that looks like, well, a video game cut scene that shows her training with Luke and realizing that she\'s going to die and not complete her journey but someone else will. Because man, Star Wars is kind of like Catholicism for people who\'d rather have Carlos Casteneda instead of John the Baptist.There\'s also a spy in the First Order, a subplot that changes nothing in the film other than to remind you that General Hux and Ben Solo probably had a tempestuous affair at one point and there\'s a thin line between love and hate.Rey, Poe, Finn, Chewbacca, BB-8 and C-3PO head out for Passanna to meet Lando Calrissian while R2-D2 stays with Leia in a military base. Soon, Kylo Ben Solo and the Knights of Ren show up just as Rey discovers a Sith dagger than C-3PO\'s programming forbids him to read. Why? Is it because he was built by Anakin Skywalker? Nah -- it\'s just another dangling ""We\'re going to kill off another beloved character"" tease and even when they wipe out the golden droid\'s memory, it comes back so quickly and easily, you wonder why they even teased this moment of sadness.I also have no idea why the Knights of Ren are important other than they will make cool looking toys and fat dudes will dress like them and bump into me at conventions.Speaking of teasing the death of a major character -- Rey uses Force Lightning to accidentally kill Chewbacca, who died way back in the book Vector Prime before the books were no longer part of the real Universe. But yeah, Chewbacca survives anyway. Seriously, they should have called this movie Star Wars: Let\'s with Chewbacca. The dude gets tortured, stripped, Rey uses his gun, one of his best friends dies and oh yeah, he had to be in this movie.Zorii Bliss (Keri Russell, who did Alias with J.J. Abrams) is in this too. She\'s a masked smuggler who had something of a relationship at one point with Poe but they never kissed, which is pretty much par for Star Wars romance. She is not Zam Wesell, so don\'t get that confused. Honestly, her scene about wanting to leave behind the planet Kijimi is about as emotionally resonant as this movie gets.Turns out that Chewbacca is still alive, so there\'s a failed rescue mission on a Star Destroyer that leads to a nice scene where Rey and Kylo have a lightsaber battle between their two worlds. That\'s when we learn that Rey is Palpatine\'s granddaughter, who tried to King Herrod her as a child, as he feared her power.So hey, why don\'t we go back to Endor. Do we have to? Yes, we do. That\'s where we meet a whole bunch of other Stormtroopers who got tired of missing every shot and took off their suits and became dudes who ride yaks. Their leader, Jannah, is not Enfys Nest from Solo: A Star Wars Story, despite similar animal mounts and markings. She and Finn quickly become friends but there\'s not even a hint of romance.Also: remember when Rose Tico was such a big deal in the last movie? Yeah, neither do the filmmakers.There\'s a cool scene where the second Death Star is in the giant black waves of Endor and Kylo and Rey have another lightsaber battle. Remember when lightsaber battles were rad and you couldn\'t wait for them, way back before Yoda zipped all around doing backflips and suddenly, you wondered how and why lightsabers could be boring? Yeah.Man, anyways, Leia dies reaching out through the Force to her son, who gets impaled by Rey but then healed by her before she runs to the Emperor\'s world to kill the old man, because you know, that\'s what he wants. He came back from the dead so the child he sent away because he feared she would kill him can kill him. Motivations are super important in Star Wars.Nearly everyone who Hasbro will sell to idiots like me dies. Star Wars has a fetish for hands getting chopped off, British accents, wipe transitions and killing off fat spaceship pilots.Luckily, Rey and Kylo fight back, but then we learn another motivation for the Emperor: he wanted to leech their youth and become strong again. So, if Rey had just killed him, did this second plan even matter? Well, he\'s every Sith and Rey ends up being every Jedi and they battle and she ends up killing him. However, because she turns his Force lightning against him, she isn\'t killing him like he wanted and this killing is OK because Star Wars.We end up back on Tatooine where Rey goes to hide the last two lightsabers and claim the name of Skywalker. Then we see Leia looking like the Virgin Mary and Luke looking like some dude who\'d go to a comic convention to meet Mark Hamill as ghosts.Question: Remember when it was a big deal that Qui-Gon Jinn didn\'t turn into a Force spirit and disappear and we were gonna get answers on that one? Yeah. Well, both Leia -- not a Jedi -- and Kylo Ben Solo disappear when they die. Of course, he kisses Rey first. And his dad shows up and calls back the ""I know"" line because this movie is fan service from frame one, bringing back holo chess when it\'s not sledgehammering plot points and deus ex machina into your feeble brainstem.This movie is a lot like sugary cereal. Sugary cereal is real good, except for how you feel sick after eating multiple bowls.Also: I kind of hate that new green robot D-O who literally talks like a Donald Trump tweet, saying ""Sad!"" when a scene is upsetting. We get it. We know it\'s sad. You don\'t have to tell us.The movie also feels like one that should pause and flash: CHECK THIS OUT! Like the tie-fighter parked next to an x-wing. We get it. We get the symbolism. Or when Wedge Antilles shows up, that kind of stuff is only for dudes like me that knew the names and call signs of every pilot. And yes, Wedge is Red Two. I was also a virgin until well into my twenties, thank you very much.So what did I like about the movie? I dug those yak creatures that they rode on the deck of the Star Destroyers and yes, I know they\'re called orbaks but I\'m going to keep on calling them yaks. And I adored Lando basically picking up Jannah and saying, ""Let\'s find out where you\'re from."" You know he\'s making her crosseyed in the back of the Millennium Falcon right now while Nien Nunb wonders why there\'s a sock on the door. I also liked the little dude named Babu Frik who wiped out C-3PO\'s mind. And I kinda dug the kintsugi look of Kylo Ren\'s new mask.Yeah, it was also nice that we saw the first same sex kiss in Star Wars between Commander D\'acy and an unnamed character that will surely get a name and a Hasbro San Diego Comic-Con two-pack release that will sell for many times the original price on eBay.Look -- I\'m not going to tell you what to like and be a gatekeeper. Love what you love, enjoy what you enjoy and spend your money where you want. That said, I spent a good chunk of my life loving Star Wars and know more about Dengar than many of the extended family members. I know -- and care -- next to nothing about anything in this film. There are people who are going to go see it a few hundred times and get the sugar rush that this film is and love it because it\'s Star Wars. Again, being a fan of the saga is a lot like being Catholic -- you know the motions, you go through them but after a while, you question why you just don\'t feel the same after Mass.', 'As happens often these days I am amazed and puzzled by the occasional very negative review of this movie. It is the tail, it seeks to wrap up 40+ years of stories about the particular fictional universe that is George Lucas\' Star Wars. With 8 movies done this 9th one can\'t be very inventive, it contains most of what we Star Wars fans have already been exposed to. Harrison Ford makes a cameo appearance. Old footage is re-purposed to include Carrie Fisher. Plus her daughter, who wasn\'t even born until 9 years after ""Return of the Jedi"", has a small role. And Mark Hamill is there too.Some reviews criticize Daisy Ridley who as Rey is a Jedi in the mold of Luke Skywalker. She is a lovely actress and she does very well in the role, I can\'t say who might have been better.In my old review of the first movie, which later became known as Episode IV - A New Hope, I wrote ""\'Star Wars\' filled our imaginations like no other movie before it. The fantastic, strange worlds were presented almost like we were there too. Aliens sitting around a tavern, enjoying drinks and speaking in all sorts of languages. Nothing before had approached the sheer size of the space ships depicted here, huge cities traveling all over the galaxy. And how about the jump to hyper speed, then disappearing from the screen as the speed exceeds light speed! And the lightsabers of the Jedi Knights. The Jedi Knights, a striking parallel to the Japanese Samurai.""That pretty well sums up why these fictional movies have a special place in cinema history. My wife and I enjoyed this one at home on BluRay from our public library. While it can\'t stand up to the original trilogy it still is a nicely entertaining movie.', ""After 'The last Jedi' divided fans (understatement?) it was up to JJ Abrams to return to guide not only this modern trilogy but also the 'Skywalker Saga' (Eps 1-9) to their conclusion.With so much to do it was a huge task he faced, but on the whole he does a decent job, picking and choosing bits from the 'Last Jedi' to take forward, while also paying a lot of lip service to fans whilst bringing down the curtain.Old favourites have their moments, there's twists and turns galore (some work, some don't) but on the whole this is a decent finale."", ""Reflective EngagementI normally write about folding; the most obvious is when a film contains a film or play, but there are a bewildering number of types. The most interesting of these to me is when the film 'folds' the watcher in, in some way. The least interesting is when a film overtly quotes another. Tarantino, does this in a way that I think distracts from his other strengths.But what happens when you have a series that is older than most people on the planet, and has a world in some way adopted by nearly everyone that folds simple myths into itself?Some of the novel folding Abrams used is required because the original three were never about a world but a story. That world was borrowed from westerns, minimally to support the story, and adapted also minimally to allow the tech. When you don't have a full world to work with, you can't expand the story into it. This world is sparse; if evil exists, it can only exist in and be opposed in one form. So, Abrams has to expand back into the story rather than into the world. He does it partly by direct quoting, adopting the key themes: parents, magical force as military force, and conflict as spatial engagement.I particularly like how he places some action in the ruins of previous movies. In episode 7, we had the star destroyer. Here we've upped the ante with the ruined death star in ultra-dynamic water.But I am going to suggest here that some of what we are seeing in the reflected story qualifies as folding. That's because the original story was a simple instance of what Lucas probably still believes is a universal myth. Enough time (36 years!) has transpired from the original trilogy and enough exposure through aggressive marketing that the original trilogy's instance has itself become the myth on which we now impress our story.Three examples: The other two films advance the story through task episodes, after which there is an escape-chase. In this third case, the film is essentially a collection of chase sequences during which the story is advanced. Because the backbone is a chase, and we have a mature editing grammar for chase episodes, the maturity of pacing is extraordinary. Blockbuster films have advanced this art and Abrams simply uses the best. There's even a situation of our heroes in corridors being hunted by stormtroopers that is filmed as a mini-chase. So, from my perspective, they've folded the confrontations into punctuations between motions.The second example: after all this time, we have competing on-screen narrators. Palpatine has been manipulating things all along and has magical insight into what our characters are doing. This is folding of the viewer into a character, but of an unimaginative kind. In a more noir-quoting film, we'd have periods where we are reminded that our on-screen drama is only because the hapless heroes are being manipulated for our entertainment. Mapping this viewer's narrative control to a villain is common.But we have something far more inventive and for this viewer, thrilling. Our two main characters can actually see each other, across galactic dimension and occupy a shared interspace. The conflict can be conveyed through this narrative space that we share with the two, especially in an extraordinary fight scene where each is projected into the other's space. But it is more than that. The entire new story that is imposed on the old, is about who sees into whom: Palpatine, Leia, Kylo, Rey, Luke, Han, and the mobs on each side have some vision and agency. Each is able to take action through this narrative space. Leia for instance significantly changes things by insight and narrative governance at a distance. Or is that Luke or Han or even Vader working through her?The third example... The original trilogy is a simple quest in the context of pure good and evil. In the first two in this trilogy, the quest is continued, with little change but a different character. In this final instalment, this is no longer the fabric, but the background for a Shakespeare-worthy love story folded into it. This is grownup stuff, and we can see the fan kids and those who want to be objecting. The Disney folks have made a bold choice I think, differentiating from their Marvel property and investing for the long run. Give me a quest for complex urges any day. That's a story fabric I can build my life around. Polar battles between good and evil don't help me and have made my world worse."", ""I think I saw it but there's so many Star Wars movies they all blend in together.

In spite of my severe disappointment with episode VIII I was going to see episode IX. I have 40 years invested in this franchise so I had to finish.This episode boiled down to everybody chasing Rey. Fin was chasing her, Poe was chasing her, Kylo Ren was chasing her, and Palpatine was chasing her. Either someone wanted to help Rey as she wandered away lone wolfing it or someone wanted to convert Rey to the Dark Side--in any case Rey was always being chased.I understand Kylo and Palpatine chasing Rey because as powerful as she was she would\'ve been a powerful asset. As for her friends... I don\'t understand. She was clearly stronger and more powerful than they or anything they had ever encountered--what did they really expect to do to ""help"" her?We found that Rey was the most powerful being to ever grace the Star Wars franchise. Master Yoda hadn\'t reached the power level of Rey and he lived 800 years!! Which is weird because she was exhibiting amazing power though she wasn\'t yet a Jedi. Which makes me realize I have no idea what a Jedi is. I thought once she knew how to use the force she was a Jedi, but apparently she was not.Jedi or not she was displaying some next level skills in a movie that was far from next level. The Rise of Skywalker was Return of the Jedi 2.0. Don\'t think so? Let\'s check the boxes: Emperor Palpatine, a secret planet destroying fleet, a Jedi fighting the urge to succumb to the Dark Side, and an unlikely assist to help defeat Emperor Palpatine. This was nothing more than a soulless rendition of Return of the Jedi.I hoped that J.J. Abrams could get us from underneath the rubble Rian Johsnon left us buried in. Maybe it was too herculian of a task to right the wrongs committed in episode VIII or maybe J.J. Abrams was locked into following in Johnson\'s footsteps. The Rise of Skywalker was nothing more than a retread of past themes blindly hoping to stumble upon success. The script and the performances seemed hollow and devoid of any life. Truly, the success of this movie resided in the name.The Star Wars brand Disney paid so handsomely for has proven to be a cash cow for the company. Regardless of whatever writer and director and their tinkering and experimentation they leave some core remnants intact and bring in the dough. Even if their tinkering mars Star Wars they will never destroy it. Star Wars has no shortage of fans such as myself that will pay to see a film titled ""Star Wars,"" but thank God this series is over.', ""Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker is a soulless film and a commemoration piece.So after the last one I had lost interest as it was beyond recovery, but I figured I may as well see it through and came into this without any positive expectation. I honestly still don't know who some of these characters are or care. Finn and Poe haven't exactly made an impression, Rey's barely holding it together by a thread. Adam Driver again and as always, awful. Palpatine takes out Kylo Ren because he gets up, but just allows Rey to recover leading to his end. Don't like that kind of stupid silliness."", '. . . I was fairly dismissive of all that jazz about the SITH being indistinguishable from the terrestrial Pachyderm Party. After all, I thought, Jerry ""Stumble-foot"" Ford reincarnated as ""Jar-Jar BINKS""?! ""Come on, get real"" an inner voice objected. However, as several new books out in the past two months document, STAR WARS IX: THE RISE OF SKYWALKER continues this saga\'s uncanny knack of dove-tailing closely with Real Life, from 1900s SITH ringleaders Noxious Nixon and Ford to more recent criminals, including The Gypper, The Weasel and The Orange Buffoon (obviously a dead ringer for Emperor PALPATINE). Just as Real Life unmasked the fact that Jar-Jar was a SITH mole, The Art of STAR WARS discloses that our POTUS #45 is a satanic SITH (aka, Red Commie Russian Kremlin KGB) asset, planted inside America\'s once-hallowed Oval Office to dance around like a marionette on strings--a pawn with no volition of its own, compelled to surrender wars, treasonously give up military secrets, betray and back-stab loyal allies, torment Ukraine and degrade the USA into a hellacious lawless knock-off of Mother Russia. STAR WARS IX\'s #1 takeaway? The Force WAS with us, but now its ""Long Live the SITH!""', ""... which is that there was no overarching story to this trilogy planned.Say what you will about the prequels -years later they aren't considered secretly great or misunderstood. But they did one thing right. They expanded the universe of Star Wars with more world building and more lore, some good, some bad. The prequel story, while stilted, was the product of a single vision. In the end you had bad execution with good building blocks.The Sequel Trilogy doesn't expand anything, instead it makes everything smaller. Star Wars has never felt so small and tired as it does after The Rise of Skywalker. Each movie exists just to tear down and apologize for what came before it. Anakin/Vader's entire character arc is completely and unforgivably undermined after this film.Overall the movie was so bloated and overstuffed with choppy pacing to course-correct from The Last Jedi. It's Flanderization in action. The original movies had so many little touches and so much atmosphere and craftsmanship beyond a few big reveals, neat action set pieces, and bizarre coincidences with the same ten people running into one another over and over. The original films built iconic imagery and characters in the context of them doing things and bonding and building. This was not always perfectly done, but it was done well enough to feel meaningful.You can't just write a movie with the assumption you already have all of those things and skip the work it takes to get them. You can trick people for awhile by using the familiar imagery and beats and deconstructing the world with meta-humor (Abrams did that well for The Force Awakens if nothing else), but you just cash in that goodwill and cheapen all of that stuff by association.Oh well, the big action movies these days are indeed made for children and China - I can't remember who recently said that, but it's true."", 'The Emperor is back. The answers will not make you happy. How? Cloning. Why? They just couldn\'t figure out an alternative, and they legitimately felt like he should be there. The Sacrifice and redemption of Anakin who? One of the best and most important aspects of the entire Saga? Never heard of it. Kylo Ren Wants to serve him. The good guys want to stop him. And at most a tiny percentage of the audience even want him to be in this in the first place. Rey has gotten some training to be a Jedi(mostly for the benefit of those who said she was OP), and discovers something that could put an end to this entire thing, and if this is all they have to offer creatively, it can\'t happen soon enough.As much as I love Episode 8, I\'m not going to pretend like it didn\'t go in a different direction from seven(even though, without that, it would not exist). And it definitely did split the fandom down the middle. So while a massive course correction isn\'t a surprise, it does remain a huge disappointment. I\'ve seen someone else say that this trilogy is the expensive Blockbuster version of a rap battle. These two directors have no respect for or interest in each other\'s creative vision. The result is a complete mess. Essentially, this is trying to be 3 different, conflicting movies at the same time. A sequel to The Force Awakens, course correction for its immediate predecessor, and starting and concluding a new story that was not at all set up before this. I mean I kind of respect the fact that, considering that, this could definitely be much worse than it is.The technical aspects are largely quite well handled. In fact, the action is good, sometimes great, with the possible exception of space battles. The actors come out looking good, and the fact that the characters really don\'t go anywhere, or the ones that do it feels awkward, is down to writing and not performances. Fan service here is ridiculous, and the attempt to appeal to those who love The last J. J. Abrams\' entry, as well as the one Rian Johnson did, considering that they literally want conflicting things, is absolutely ridiculous. There are a number of scenes in this that are later made irrelevant(no, I don\'t just mean ""less compelling""), at one point it covers a 40 minutes chunk(!). This made some not care about Star Wars anymore, and others outright hate it. Considering the high quality of The Mandalorian, I don\'t fall into either of those camps, but I\'m definitely not particularly interested in more theatrical entries, with the exception of the one helmed by Patty Jenkins, one of my favourite filmmakers.This features mild violence. I recommend this only to those who want closure. 5/10.', 'As soon as it was revealed that Rey is the granddaughter of Palpatine, and that Palpatine somehow still lives(!!???), I was officially done with this trilogy.Come on, how much can one story possible recycle from another? J.J. Abrams couldn\'t come up with anything as good as George Lucas\'s original story and characters, so he just borrows and mixes enough to try to fool us into thinking we\'re getting sequels rather than reboots, but he fails. Rian Johnson tried to take the story in some new and potentially interesting directions (though ""The Last Jedi"" had plenty of flaws in its own right), but all of them are thrown out the window in ""Rise of Skywalker."" It\'s like the second installment never even happened. The only moments that roused me from my theater seat were those that referenced the original trilogy.Worst of all, ""The Rise of Skywalker"" undermines even the modest joys to be had from ""The Force Awakens"" and ""The Last Jedi,"" because now we see the story in its entirety and are aware of how flimsy it all is. It\'s painfully obvious that this trilogy\'s story was made up as it went along and not conceived as a cohesive whole. That\'s what made the first trilogy so good, and even the second trilogy, dorky as it is, has a fantastic and well mapped story to tell. This is just Disney throwing spaghetti at a wall to see what sticks and hoping that ""Star Wars"" fans are so loyal to the franchise that they\'ll throw their money at any garbage as long as the ""Star Wars"" logo is attached to it.Grade: C', 'The opening crawl reveals that a mysterious broadcast has been heard across the galaxy in the voice of the late Emperor Palpatine. General Leia Organa dispatches agents across the galaxy to gather information on this, while Kylo Ren, now Supreme Leader of the First Order, searches for Palpatine in an effort to eliminate all potential threats to his power.He steals an ancient Sith device called a ""Wayfinder"" from the planet Mustafar, and uses it to navigate the galaxy\'s unknown regions. Soon, he finds Exagol, the mythical home world of the Sith. Sure enough, Palpatine awaits him there, having returned from the dead via unnatural means following Darth Vader\'s betrayal in Return Of The Jedi - though he still needs to be hooked up to machinery operated by a cult-like group of Sith loyalists to stay alive.Palpatine reveals he has been pulling the strings of the First Order this whole time - he created Snoke to act as a puppet leader, and helped tempt Kylo to the Dark Side. Kylo intends to kill Palpatine like he killed Snoke, but the former Emperor reveals that he has spent the last 30 years constructing an entire fleet of Star Destroyers - each with the power of a Death Star. He tells Kylo that he could be the ruler of the new Galactic Empire if he destroys Rey, and ends the Jedi Order. But he also warns Kylo that there is more to Rey\'s story than he may realize...Meanwhile, Finn, Poe Dameron and Chewbacca meet with an informant for the Resistance who tells them that there is a spy in the First Order leaking information. He gives them a message in the form of a data encoder, but squadrons of TIE-Fighters arrive and attack them. Finn, Poe and Chewie are forced to flee in the Millennium Falcon, which takes some damage during their escape, but ultimately manages to get away and destroy a number of its pursuers.On the jungle world Ajan-Kloss, where the Resistance is currently based, Rey is learning the ways of the Force from Leia. She expresses frustration at her inability to communicate with the ghosts of the Jedi who came before, but Leia patiently encourages her young student. During her training session, Rey is startled when she has a shared vision with Kylo Ren, due to their Force connection - flashes of scenes from the previous two movies are shown during this scene. She becomes distracted by the vision, and accidentally drops a tree on BB8.The Falcon returns from its mission. Rey, appalled by the state it\'s in, argues with Poe, who is frustrated that she chooses to stay back at the base training when she\'s the best fighter the Resistance has. Poe then reveals to the rest of the Resistance that their worst fears have been confirmed: Palpatine is back, and in 16 hours, his massive fleet will be unleashed onto the galaxy. This will be what the Sith Lord calls ""the Final Order"".The Resistance will need to get to Exagol and destroy the fleet before it is released, but C3PO explains that there are no maps leading there. Rey remembers something she read in the Jedi texts from Ahch-To - that Luke had gone on a failed search for a Sith wayfinder (the only other one in existence) sometime before his self-imposed exile. All that is known is that the Wayfinder is somewhere on the desert planet Pasaana. Leia agrees to send Rey there and meet with a contact of hers. Finn, Poe, Chewie, 3PO and BB8 insist on coming along. The heroes say their goodbyes - Finn to Rose Tico, 3PO to R2D2, and Rey to Leia - before departing in the Falcon.Having repaired his damaged helmet, Kylo Ren convenes a meeting of the First Order council. He informs his Generals that there is a spy in their midst. Generals Hux and Pryde stare at each other accusingly. One General expresses skepticism about Palpatine\'s true intentions behind helping them, but Kylo Force-chokes him and levitates his body aggressively to the ceiling. He then prepares to hunt down Rey with his Knights of Ren.The Falcon lands on Pasaana, and the crew arrive at a vibrant festival. Rey is asked her name by one of the natives, and she replies that she\'s ""just Rey"". Kylo then reaches out to Rey via the Force and figures out where she is by taking the necklace she was given by the natives of Pasaana. Rey warns her friends that the First Order is coming.The group is then met by Leia\'s contact, who turns out to be none other than Lando Calrissian. He reveals that many years ago, he accompanied Luke on a mission to track down a man named Ochi, who may have had information regarding the location of the second Wayfinder. They found Ochi\'s ship abandoned in the desert, where it remains to this day. Lando chose to remain on Pasaana. He gives the heroes directions to where Ochi\'s ship lies.First Order Stormtroopers arrive, forcing the heroes to flee through the desert. The group ends up sinking through Quicksand, and find themselves in an underground cave where they discover Ochi\'s remains. Next to him is a dagger that 3PO realizes has an inscription written in the ancient language of the Sith. Unfortunately, his programming forbids him from translating it, much to Poe\'s frustration. They are then attacked by a giant creature which Rey realizes is injured, and heals with the Force. The creature tunnels an escape route for them out of gratitude.Outside, they find Ochi\'s ship, but Rey senses that Kylo is near, and goes to hold him off so her friends have time to escape. She damages Kylo\'s TIE-Fighter, but Chewie is captured by the Knights of Ren along with the dagger, and placed on a First Order transport ship. Rey tries to pull the transport towards her with the Force, but Kylo attempts to do the same. Eventually, a burst of Force Lightning unexpectedly shoots from Rey\'s hand, destroying the transport. Rey is devastated that she has seemingly killed Chewie, but escapes in Ochie\'s ship with her friends, while Kylo and his troops steal the Falcon.Finn comforts Rey on the ship, as she is still heartbroken over Chewie. 3PO reveals that he committed the dagger\'s inscription to his memory, and the group figures out that if they could bypass 3PO\'s programming, he could translate it for them. Poe says he knows a black market Droidsmith on the planet Kijimi who might be able to do just that. Meanwhile, BB8 befriends another little droid called D-O on the ship.The group lands on Kijimi, and encounter a Spice Runner named Zorii Bliss, who is revealed to be an old friend (and possibly ex-lover) of Poe\'s. Zorii brings them to Babu Frik, the droidsmith Poe mentioned. Frik says he can bypass 3PO\'s programming, but in doing so, he will have to wipe the droid\'s memory. Despite this, 3PO insists on going ahead with it anyway, prepared to sacrifice his memory for the good of the Resistance\'s cause. Frik hacks into 3PO\'s memory, and he translates the inscription, revealing that the other Wayfinder is on the remains of the second Death Star. 3PO then reboots, having lost all his memories. Zorii gives Poe a First Order captain\'s medallion to help them get through the First Order\'s security.The First Order arrives on Kijimi, having tracked the group there. Rey senses that Chewie is alive on their ship, and realizes he must have been on a different transport to the one she destroyed. The heroes agree to use the medallion to get on board the ship and rescue Chewie and the Falcon.On board the ship, the group is separated - Finn and Poe are captured alongside Chewie. Rey comes across the Sith dagger, and touches it, experiencing a vision that reveals Ochi killed her parents. It seems that he had been sent after her, and her parents sold her to keep their daughter safe. Kylo senses that Rey is on board his ship.Finn, Poe and Chewie are about to be executed by the First Order. However, Hux saves them and reveals that he is the spy - he doesn\'t care whether or not the Resistance wins, but he is sabotaging the First Order\'s cause out of spite towards Kylo Ren.Kylo arrives to confront Rey, and finally reveals the truth to her: her father was the son of Palpatine, making her the Emperor\'s granddaughter. He also reveals that they are connected because they are a ""dyad"" in the Force, and once again tries to convince her to join him. Rey refuses, and escapes on the Falcon with Finn, Poe, Chewie, 3PO, BB8 and D-O.General Pryde figures out that Hux was the spy, and kills him. Palpatine then issues an order for Kijimi to be destroyed by one of his Star Destroyers. The First Order is still able to follow the heroes, because they scanned the dagger and translated its inscription before they arrived.The remains of the second Death Star are located on an ocean moon near Endor. There, the group are met by a tribe of ex-Stormtroopers led by a young woman named Jannah. She and Finn bond over having both escaped from the First Order.Rey braves her way through the perilous ocean to make her way to the Death Star. She gets the Wayfinder, then has a vision of herself as a Sith. Kylo then arrives and destroys the Wayfinder, meaning Rey can only reach Exagol if she comes with him. Rey becomes angered, and they begin a lightsaber duel. For a time, it looks like Kylo is winning - but Leia senses the duel back on Ajan-Kloss.Desperate, Leia reaches out to her son through the Force, causing him to hesitate. Rey takes this opportunity to stab Kylo with her lightsaber - but realizes too late that this also affects Leia, since she and Kylo were connected at the time. Rey heals Kylo with the Force, but is unable to save Leia, who dies back at the base. Distraught, and still haunted by the revelation of her true lineage, Rey steals Kylo\'s TIE-Fighter and leaves.She returns to Ahch-To, intending to exile herself there as Luke once did. But when she tries to burn the Skywalker lightsaber, Luke\'s Force Ghost appears and stops her. He tells her that she must not make the same mistake he did, and reveals that Leia knew of her Palpatine lineage all along, but still trained her. He then gives her a lightsaber that was intended for Leia before she gave up her Jedi training because of her pregnancy. Rey remembers that Kylo has the other Wayfinder in his TIE-Fighter and removes it. Luke levitates his X-Wing out of the water (mirroring the scene where Yoda does the same thing in The Empire Strikes Back), and Rey sets a course for Exagol.Meanwhile, Kylo is more conflicted than ever, and racked with remorse over his mother\'s death. He has a vision of his father, Han Solo, encouraging him to renounce the Dark Side and return to the light. Kylo tosses his lightsaber away, reclaiming his identity as Ben Solo.With Kylo presumed dead, Pryde takes command of the Sith fleet on Exagol, and destroys Kijimi. We also learn that Pryde served Palpatine during the days of the Galactic Empire.Finn, Poe and the others (now accompanied by Jannah) return to Ajan-Kloss, and are informed of Kijimi\'s destruction as well as Leia\'s death. Chewie breaks down and howls in anguish over Leia\'s passing, and Poe is informed that he is to succeed her as General.Poe does not feel that he has what it takes to be the leader Leia was. Lando arrives, and Poe asks him how he, Leia, Han and Luke were able to take on a whole Empire when the odds seemed stacked against them. Lando replies that they had each other, and encourages Poe.R2 backs up 3PO\'s memory, and then starts receiving a signal from Luke\'s X-Wing. Realizing it\'s Rey, and that she is leading them all to Exagol, Poe appoints Finn as his co-General, and prepares to lead a Resistance fleet against Palpatine\'s Star Destroyers. Lando is sent off in the Falcon to gather reinforcements from across the galaxy.Rey arrives on Exagol and confronts Palpatine, who tells her to strike him down, so his spirit may pass into her. He threatens to destroy her friends if she does not. Rey is about to carry out the deed, but senses that Ben has arrived to help her. The two manage to share Leia\'s lightsaber via their Force connection, and take down the Knights of Ren together. Palpatine realizes they are a dyad in the Force, and draws life force from them, rejuvenating himself. He declares that nothing will stop the return of the Sith, and tosses Ben down a nearby chasm, seemingly killing him.The Resistance engages in battle with the First Order\'s fleet, but all seems hopeless, as they are outnumbered and overpowered. Just as Poe thinks the battle is lost, Lando arrives with a massive fleet of ships from across the galaxy. Among the reinforcements are Zorii and Babu Frik (who escaped Kijimi before it was destroyed) and Rebellion veteran Wedge Antilles. Now, the Resistance has their own army capable of taking on the First Order.In Palpatine\'s throne-room, a weakened Rey lies on the floor. Suddenly, she begins to hear the voices of the fallen Jedi reaching out to her - she hears Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, Yoda, Qui-Gon Jinn, Mace Windu, Ahsoka Tano, Kanan Jarrus, Aayla Secura, Luminara Unduli, Adi Gallia, and finally, Luke Skywalker, all of whom say that they will stand behind her, and she must rise up to destroy the Emperor and restore balance.Rey gets to her feet, and Palpatine attempts to shoot Force Lighting at her, which she deflects with Leia and Luke\'s lightsabers. Palpatine angrily says that she is powerless to stop him, and declares ""I am ALL THE SITH!"". Rey responds ""and I...am all the Jedi"", and deflects the lighting back at her grandfather, disintegrating his body and destroying the lord of the Sith once and for all.The effort drains all life from Rey, and she begins to die. Ben crawls out of the chasm and transfers his life force to Rey, reviving her. They share a kiss before he dies, redeemed just like his grandfather before him. Meanwhile, the Resistance destroys the First Order\'s fleet, killing Pryde.The heroes reunite at Ajan-Kloss. Maz Kanata presents Chewie with one of the medals Leia presented Luke and Han with in A New Hope. Lando offers to help Jannah find her long-lost family. Rey, Finn and Poe embrace, celebrating their victory over the First Order.Sometime later, Rey and BB8 take the Falcon to Tatooine, and visit the now-abandoned Lars homestead where Luke Skywalker was raised by his aunt and uncle. She buries the Skywalker lightsabers there, having constructed her own. A local passes by, and remarks that nobody has come by here in a long time. She asks who Rey is. Rey tells her her name. ""Rey who?"" asks the stranger. As the ghosts of Luke and Leia smile over her, Rey responds ""Rey Skywalker"". She and BB8 then watch the twin suns of Tatooine, just as Luke used to do as a young man - but now, they are rising and not setting.']"
9,Star Wars,Star Wars: The Clone Wars,458290,"['This takes place between episode 2 and 3 during the Clone Wars. It follows the adventures of Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi. Anakin is assigned Ahsoka Tano as his Padawan. The Jedi lead the Republican forces against the Separatists led by Count Dooku and General Grievous. Darth Maul is also revealed to be alive despite losing his lower half. There are lots of revealing backstory filling in the rest of the story.I am no fan of the prequels. There are good things about them but those are overwhelmed by the problems. After the disaster of The Clone Wars movie, the franchise was truly in danger. At first, the TV show was only marginally better than the movie. As the series progresses, it is able to fill in the vision of this world. It actually made Anakin a fuller and more human character. This show may have saved the Star Wars universe.', 'Right, well back in the day when ""Star Wars: The Clone Wars"" initially came out, I managed to sit through two seasons before giving up on the series. Why? Well, as much of a ""Star Wars"" fan as I am, then the animation and art style was just a bitter pill to swallow, and I never really been a fan of the Clone Wars era in the ""Star Wars"" universe.So I put the series to rest back then, but had to return to give it a second chance in 2021, as many people said that it got better with the later seasons. So I endured and sat through it. And true enough, you actually just have to get past the first one and a half seasons, then the series actually starts to pick up and improve greatly with each season. And especially seasons 6 and 7 were quite phenomenal.There are many, many different story arcs throughout the seven seasons, some with greater appeal and contents than others, of course. As it was to be expected from something running for seven seasons. So there is a great that that ""Star Wars: The Clone Wars"" actually holds something for just about any one in the audience.And I have to admit that I am glad that I returned to re-watch this and give it a second chance, because I was definitely missing out on a great many things, despite it being set in the Clone Wars era. And I also have to say that ""Star Wars: The Clone Wars"" definitely put Darth Maul in a whole new light for me. I didn\'t like him one bit when I saw him in ""Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace"", but ""Star Wars: The Clone Wars"" brings so much story to his character and really flesh him out - pardon the pun - to be a much more interesting character than what you see in ""Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace"".Sure, the animation and art style used in ""Star Wars: The Clone Wars"" still is something of an acquired taste, but I came to bear with it. But it was by no means something that would win me over if it came down to that.The series delves greatly into the different story arcs for a great many characters, with the likes of Obi-Wan Kenobi, Ahsoka Tano, Anakin Skywalker, Count Dooku, Padmé Amidala, Cad Bane, and even clones such as Rex and Cody. Luckily and thankfully the abysmal clown known as Jar Jar Binks wasn\'t an overshadowing character in the series, as he didn\'t have that many appearances.""Star Wars: The Clone Wars"" is definitely worth spending the time to sit down and watch. I happened to binge-watch all seven episodes over a course of a couple of days, and I was greatly entertained.My rating of ""Star Wars: The Clone Wars"" lands on an eight out of ten stars collectively throughout the seven seasons combined.', ""It's a good series, I can't watch it all the time. I try to watch it if I have time, I think it's a good series, I'm sure it will be good even though I haven't finished it yet."", ""Clone Wars starts out as seeming like a mostly pretty lightweight bit of family entertainment with touches of the more exciting and more serious aspects of Star Wars. However, it develops to be a hugely powerful and astoundingly high quality addition to the overall story.The animation gets better and better as it goes along and is absolutely stunning in later seasons.The storytelling manages to totally transcend an animated 'kids show'. It becomes WAY more than that. There are heart poundingly exciting episodes and heartbreakingly moving stories as well as deepening and strengthening of the whole saga by the clever and wonderful storytelling of this show.Yes there are quite a few fillers along the way which are chucked in as light relief but the serious and dark stories that grow throughout the 7 seasons are phenomenally strong and superb quality.This stands easily alongside the best movies as great Star Wars. The writing and voice acting are terrific while the action and animation is amazing."", ""This is Paw Patrol with much uglier drawings. And somehow because this is a children's show the Love Your Leaders theme is much more stronger than in the movies."", 'Star Wars: The Clone WarsWell this just got better and better, personally I would have had a continuous narrative flow between episodes as we have seen how successful this approach is with The Mandalorian, even though this demands more of the viewer as there is scant recap, but to Star Wars ""nerds"" this is a joy!Also to vary episode lengths to cut the story by way of ""comas"" creates its own narrative impetus.Series 2 really stepped up, much darker, more complex, more depth, it was quite frankly brilliant! It just had more of everything with the best thing being comprehensively developed evil villains, intrigue and use of the force. I even think the animation was more creative. The change between series 1 and 2 is so great is quite inexplicable.Series 3 we had Zero Hut this was inspired from start to finish what a joy!Throughout the whole thing we have one terrible character, Padhme amadala, she is a mixture of condescension, passive aggression and negativity, she presents herself as a principled politician but she just latches onto one woke trope after another, usually at the expense of ridiculing men. It is rare to see writers so misunderstanding ""female empowerment"", instead they portray a bully in competition with men rather than the rounded and conflicted female character we see in Asoka Adana In the original movies this character injects humour, the onerous weight of responsibility and romance, they should have stuck with this! In series 3 episode 11 this culminated in arguing that the war against the Separatists should be conceded as the money spend on defending democracy should be diverted to the welfare state. Without grasping that democracy is suspended when a sovereign state is threatened as war cannot be conducted by committee, and without defending yourselves against tyranny there will be no state to speak of. It really was quite idiotic!Series 4 -7 started to show the war from different perspectives, we had an episode led by droids, we had an episode led by clones. This really was a very good idea and really kept the show fresh and allowed more in depth back stories.Overall this is beyond description in its reinvention, it characterisations, it story lines, the scoring, the animation. When you look to see how far animation has come in recent years and it\'s elevation to near parity with ""real actors"" it\'s mindblowing!I would not cancel this series but have several separate teams working on the Bad Batch, Clone Wars as there is room for both and more and fans are gathering to this work. I think better awareness is needed as I only recently discovered it.', ""I finished watching the awesome Star Wars the clone wars yesterday and I have got to say the force is strong in this show.This show has pretty much every thing what a Star Wars fan would want, fight scenes, likable characters and of course different story arcs to keep you interested my favorite ones are when R2 D2 gets kidnapped by the separatist, the arc where the clones and the Jedi to protect a clone base and the one where Fives discovers his clone trouper chip. What more could you want?And it doesn't stop there the animation is awesome and the voice actors are incredible we even get guest stars like Nolan North, Liam Neeson, Seth Green, Gideon Emery, Simon Pegg and much more.At first, when I saw this back when I was younger I used to find it boring and annoying. But now I don't think that any more I think this an incredible show which needs a season 7.I would recommend this show to new and old generation of Star Wars fans."", ""Star Wars: The Clone Wars is a well made and well directed show that expands upon the classic movies before it, and it mends the wounds The Prequel Trilogy inflicted for many longtime fans of the franchise. The show isn't always smooth-sailing: some of the episodes focusing on too much on politics of 'Trade Negotiations' and 'Separatist *stuff*' can become tedious like these subplots; that were in The Phantom Menace.Despite some of the inherent flaws of The Prequels, The Clone Wars doesn't get weighed down by its unfortunate burden; it makes new stories more relevant to The Original Trilogy than many fans saw coming, like cryptic clues about what's to come in Episode IV: such as the power of the force, the afterlife of Jedis and the impending doom The Dark Side may unleash if The Republic doesn't fight back against The Sith Lords.The Clone Wars can afford to expand upon areas where The Prequel films could not do before: thanks to the flexibility of television serial-storytelling. There's breathing room for the story arcs to come full circle and leave you satisfied with what's to come. We see a lot of classic Star Wars stuff that sometimes teeters between plot-relevance to fan-service, but most of it is all there for a reason and does not go to waste.This show is what Star Wars fans have been wanting since The Prequel Trilogy finished; and even up against the newly released Star Wars Rebels cartoon it still holds up very well."", ""Last Summer One Began The Clone Wars On Netflix the Series what I personally Hail as The Summer Of The Clone Wars which Stars James Arnold Taylor(Green Lantern Emerald Knights) as Obi -Wan Kenobi, Matt Lanter(Vampires Suck) as Anakin Skywalker .

While I did not see the associated animated film (because of the very bad reviews), this show seems to have some very good things going for it.For a TV series, the visuals and sounds are really great. The colors, scenery and style of ""3D"" animation are really appealing. And the sounds (including character voices) are pretty well done too.Characters: It took me three episodes to get comfortable with the new look of the main characters. It was a bit awkward watching them at first, but now it\'s OK. One slight issue I still have is that they sometimes remind me of characters from a kid\'s show than a general audience show.But that\'s OK - it\'s really great to have 30 minutes of good quality Star Wars story-telling each week. The force is with this show!', ""After many years and a big buildup we have finally seen the 7th and final season of The Clone Wars and I have finished the season and here is my review. The premise of the season sees Ahsoka attempt to move on from her exile from the Jedi while Captain Rex attempts to prepare his troops for the end of the war.Main Character Even though the first few seasons focused on Anakin Skywalker in my opinion the real main character of the Clone Wars is easily that of Ahsoka as we see her story really develop through our eyes. From the movie where she is introduced as this young padawan to this season where she is more of this conflicted person who isn't exactly sure of her place in this war but also wants to help people and do things the Jedi won't. Her character is so well done this season and I think the way her arc ends this season is done flawlessly and really gives a payoff for really 12 years of a character on this show.Supporting Characters The other original character that gets a great story arc is that of Captain Rex. To see his characrter arc from the movie to now is enthralling. This season alone you see his character go through all types of emotions, I think the point if this show was to make you care about The Clone Troopers and I really cared about Rex this season and thought he had a really interesting story. Maul was a character introduced in The Phantom Menace but in my opinion he didn't become an interesting character till he returned on this show. His character is very menacing but he is a great opposite to Ahsoka and there stories are fascinating, they are both thrust into the limelight away from there masters and you see Mauls own plans and how they affect the story. Anakin & Obi-Wan are in this season less but they are well handled, ties to Anakin's eventual turn are still here and are heavily implied. The relationship between Anakin & Ahsoka is pretty heartbreaking here and again it feels like a worthy payoff for the show.Story The show has two great story arcs in it, seeing Rex and The Bad Batch's story was great showing the development of Rex and how the clones really differ at this point. Then Ahsoka's character plot is fascinating, this could be as a bit of a spoiler but the show comes to the point of crossing over with Revenge Of The Sith and the way it is handled is truly emotional. Plus with it being the end of the show is has to have a satisfying ending which this show truly does and it is handled perfectly. Though I have an issue with the story being the middle story with Ashoka hanging out with the Martinez sisters, as much as I like Ahsoka as a character I just didn't care for this story and it takes up way too many episodes with very little payoff in my opinion.Script The script is brilliant this season, the drama feels much more mature this season and there are some truly gutwrenching moments that even though we have been expecting them I thought they were handled brilliantly. Also when used the humour is better this season and makes the characters feel much more human and a more complete package for the characters which previous seasons have lacked.Style The style of the show is the best ever for sure, it is crazy to see how the animation has developed from the movie to now. The characters feel more alive and the action scenes are brilliant to watch. The lightsaber fight between Maul & Ashoka is memorable and a great moment which will stand out for many years to come. The show also benefits from having only 12 episodes and it flows much better then any of the other seasons for sure.Overall Overall, this is easily the best ever season of the show it ends brilliantly and it really makes the 12 year journey feel worth it and this is easily one of the best Star Wars things around and I think may lead to Star Wars trying to nail more animated shows for sure.Rating - 9/10."", 'And I\'m someone who up until a few months ago, still loved the new trilogy (mostly) and I still consider Revenge of the Sith to be on par with the original trilogy. I\'ve read at least 100 Star Wars books, and a great many of the games. I realize there is a lot of crap under the banner of Star Wars. But... this series (and likely the movie as well) is a horrendous abomination.The dialogue is beyond horrendous, and makes the most awkward ""love"" scenes in Episode II feel like the work of Shakespeare by comparison. It\'s worse even than typical children\'s\' shows in that while it\'s obviously aimed for children, it\'s still unbelievably terrible, and so full of stupid puns and tired expressions and dull monotonous recitation of lines that I imagine even the target audience would be bored with these sequences, and fast forward through all but the battle scenes.Jar Jar Binks is rendered pleasant in comparison to this Padawan girl that Anakin is inexplicably given to train (Jedi Knights do not train Padawans; only Masters) whose entire role consists of generic ""tough girl"" sassy quips and ridicule.The 3D animation is what you\'d expect from a LucasFilms budget, but perhaps to keep themselves linked with the much more successful (even though I hated it) Clone Wars micro-sodes by Genndy Tartakovsky, they retain the stupid shapes of people\'s heads that consists of various juxtapositions of gravity-defying squares, circles, and polygons. Count Dooku\'s beard looks like the triangular front-piece of an old-time freight train, and it looks stiff as metal, too.The battle scenes would certainly be the highest appeal for children, but for the non-children watcher, even those are usually made a mess by the constant stale quips and jabbering between Obi-Wan and Anakin and That Annoying Girl being spoken/yelled at one another throughout an entire sequence.Obviously the point of this series is to make an open-ended source of stories, no matter how stale or hackily written, to be exploited for episode fodder and money.', 'I remember when I first saw the clone wars back in 2008 (season one) I was just amazed by the animation, the storytelling, the plot and the characters. some people may say this is the ""clone wars"" era at it\'s best and other people may say this is ""star wars"" at it\'s best. I tend to agree with those people who say it is ""star wars"" at it\'s finest. I mean seriously now, this TV series is good in so many levels you can\'t compare it to other series of star wars and expect it will not be better then others right?. as good as the other series of star wars might be, this particular one is phenomenal and amazing. although I did have a few issues with this show over the years. when the series got canceled by disney due to other projects in the making, the crew of TCW released the unfinished episodes of season seven and I had a hard time watching those episodes because of how bad it looked, of course season seven now is way better with the animation. also there were many arcs and stories that were boring and unnecessary, when I watch a series like TCW I want to focus only on the stories and the arcs that are all about the clone wars: not ahsoka\'s arc (seriously stop involving ahsoka in every star wars content just kill her already). I also don\'t care about asajj ventress\'s arc nor any arc that is\'t about the clones. now the clones are the main characters in this show, well at least I think that way. the plot is focuesed on them and I really feel like those characters in particular give a lot to the show, I used to grew up on them and ever since I enjoyed their characters and wanted to focus only on them and their stories. I love how the series is humanizing the clones and giving them diffrent personality to each of them. captain rex and the rest of the 501th legion are my favorite clones. but everything has an ending and yesterday may the 4th the clone wars ended with it\'s final episode ""victory and death"". the final episode does not only end season seven and the last story arc of TCW but ends the whole series forever. well... it was a ride, a great ride. goodbye old friend may the force be with you. always...', 'Note: I have seen all 7 seasons.The series continues from the animated movie, and some aspects have improved while others stayed the same or got worse. Ahsoka\'s sass was turned way down, which is a very welcome change in character. She\'s still the same stubbornly confident amateur, just without the nasty snarkiness. The childish humor was also dialed back, though not completely removed, and it does feel closer to the humor of the original and prequel movies. The character faces and physical movement are still limited by the budget. Backgrounds also remain relatively bland, though background characters are not as stiff as they were in the movies.I\'ve heard that the writers were not aware that they had creative freedom over the series until about halfway through the second season. Up until that point, the series was fairly bland with no lasting effects on the Star Wars universe. If you want to skip to the good parts, here are my recommendations by season:Movie - Watch it if you want an introduction to Ahsoka (Anakin\'s padawan) and Ventris (the new Sith), but the series begins so episodic with no overarching story, so it won\'t really matter if you skip this. 5/10Season 1 - Some episodes are as good or slightly better than the animated movie, but some are downright bad by directly contradicting or trivializing aspects of the canon stories. Fans probably won\'t mind watching the whole season, but I recommend that you only watch episode 22 for a hardcore introduction to an epic villain. 4/10Season 2 - Significantly more creative action sequences and plots. Episodes 4 & 11 were terribly written, and 18 & 19 were so-so, but every other episode was enjoyable and exciting. 6/10Season 3 - Noticably improved animations and details, especially with body language and natural movement, though facial expressions are still limited. This season takes more risks with the story arcs. Some of the risks don\'t pay off, but the ones that do are some of my favorite episodes so far. If you\'re skipping most of season 1 like I recommend, you can also skip episode 3. Episode 5 was also boring and didn\'t affect the plot, and episodes 6 and 8 were terribly written. 7/10Season 4 - Like season 3, with even fewer busts, and even greater booms. This is the season where the story begins to really live up to the ""wars"" in its name. The battle sequences are fantastically choreographed with actual military tactics employed in unique Star Wars universe applications. The only episodes I didn\'t enjoy were 4-6 and 11-13. Episode 17 had stupid motivations, but it\'s necessary for its story arc. 8/10Season 5 (first half) - My least favorite season since season 1. Episodes 2-5 were uninspired and contradictory, espisodes 7-9 were idiotic, and 10-13 were childish. 5/10Season 5 (second half) - Drastically improved storylines with an inspired and terrifying villain and truly emotional scenes. Episode 17 was contradictory, but the rest was epic on a level that I never thought this cartoon could be. 9/10Season 6 - As the series closes, this season helps set the stage for the movie Episode III. Episode 5 was full of plot holes and fallacies, episodes 8-9 were so-so. Episodes 10-13 were enjoyable for Yoda\'s part of the arc, but Dooku\'s arc introduced possibly the biggest plot hole in Star Wars canon thus far. Episodes 1-4 and 6-7 provide some decidedly ominous foreshadowing, but I recommend skipping the rest. 7/10Season 7 - This is the epitome of the series. Story and art both receive drastic quality improvements. It is better if you\'ve already seen the movie Episode III before watching this season, but it\'s still easy to follow for those who haven\'t. 10/10If you prefer to keep Boba Fett a mystery, the following episodes definitely detract from a romanticized view of him, so you may want to skip these as well: S02 E20-22, S04E20', ""The first 5 seasons of this show was very well done, just like the prequels it's based off of!! The problem is in season 6!! Disney took what made this show good and turned it into a political show!! The Star Wars heart was put aside in this season for the political nonsense!! If not for season 6, I would give the show a 9. I'm not looking forward to what more damage Disney will do in season 7!!"", 'Not enough actual ""story"" for so many episodes.The same things occur over and over again and the same dismal lines are delivered flatly just as often.The Tano character is clearly a joke, right?The inability or unwillingness to immediately follow orders or military protocol is a joke, right?The willingness to knowingly walk into ""trap"" situations is hilarious, right?The absolute invulnerability of the main characters doesn\'t possibly ruin the ""tension"", does it?Don\'t bother watching this tripe.', 'It looks like Star Wars, sounds like Star Wars and feels like Star Wars. I was surprised to see that someone else actually understood Star Wars, because so far no one other than the creator has. Upon watching the special features I learned why. George Lucas is involved with everything. Go figure.The thing this show does best is not tie itself down to connecting with the movies. In Revenge of the Sith Obi, Anakin and Grevious meet for the first time. In the show they see each other all the time. Same with Dooku. In the movie they haven\'t met since Attack of the Clones, they see each other and fight all the time.Also since they\'ve established that reality and the fact that it\'s a cartoon, it allows me to accept things that wouldn\'t fly in the movies. Like Darth Maul coming back. I love Maul as much as everyone else and I\'d love to see more of him but he\'s dead. If the dismemberment to the abdomen didn\'t kill him then the fall certainly did. And there\'s absolutely nothing that could ever bring him back, not even the force. But since this is a cartoon, it\'s good to see him again.Anakin would\'ve have an apprentice but it\'s a good story and Asoka is great. And the really genre specific stories, like zombies and monster stuff wouldn\'t fly in the movies but are cool here.The idea of a clone war show is great from the get go because in the movies we don\'t really see them. And General Grevious is so cool and we hardly get to see him so it\'s nice to have a show featuring him so heavily, doing all the things I was hoping to see in 3.The emphasis is on the action and it\'s so cool. They do a very good job of supporting themes and character traits from the movies.I like that not ever story follows our main guys. Sometimes they aren\'t in it at all. It\'s nice to follow those background Jedi that look so good and hardly have any screen time.After the movie this show gets dark pretty quick. A lot of cold blooded murder and scary monsters. That\'s what\'s so good about having a cartoon that isn\'t on Disney.One thing that I really love as a lifelong Star Wars fan is that they use unused ideas from the other movies. Repurposed or exact, it\'s great to see these ideas on screen. Having endlessly looked through the art books and hoping that there was only someway to use these great shelved ideas, I was very surprised to see them.I\'ve watched it several times because it\'s so good.Unfortunately Disney cancelled it because they don\'t want anything to do with the prequels or a show not on their Network, leaving us without a conclusion. I don\'t think they really care about Star Wars, do you? Only money. That was strike 1. They dropped this successful show without an ending to make Rebels? That show sucked. And why? No Lucas.They\'ve brought it back now but too late Disney, you\'ve already burned this bridge. They brought it back because they need to do something to bring the fans back. They cancel it for no reason only a few years later to bring it back to appease the fans because they realized they screwed up? Their own ""original"" stories aren\'t pulling in fans? What a surprise.', '4.06 billion. Try to visualize the number, try hard. That\'s the amount Disney bought Lucasfilm for in 2012. That\' should give you an idea not just of what all Star Wars-related products past are worth, but all those still to come (and let\'s not forget the not-insignificant property that is Indiana Jones). That number is also a testament to how unshakable the filmgoing public\'s belief has remained in George Lucas\' galaxy far, far away.Build it (with a big fat Star Wars logo on it) and we will come. We\'re largely forgiven for being this loyal and enthusiastic back in 1999, when the prequels began screening around the world, and decreasingly so as years went by. George Lucas the writer finally caught up with George Lucas the visionary, and for every answer given to questions none of us had really asked (who built C3PO? What was Boba Fett\'s childhood like?), new questions were raised, or rather serious inconsistencies.It is a very welcome and unexpected surprise that the best part of the 21st century Star Wars revival has been not the films, but Lucasfilms two partnerships with Cartoon Network. Gennedy Tartakovsky\'s superbly playful and silly Clone Wars traditional animation miniseries gave the prequel time line a much-needed boost, but the heart and soul of these characters was to be found in this show.Kicking off with a very average feature-length episode (still no blemish on the dismal first 2 prequels), the series took a season to find its footing, experimenting with more infantile episodes and darker material (an early episode revealing General Grievous\' lair is an early highlight and makes promises much of the later seasons truly deliver on).Further bridging the gap between episodes II and III, the Clone Wars converts Tartakovsky\'s drawings to 3D with surprising success. The result is unique, and often quite stunning to look at. The characterizations start off a bit wooden and improve throughout, really blossoming when it comes to new characters, especially the villainous Asaj Ventress, bounty hunter Cad Bane and pirate Hondo. What worked in the films works even better here - especially Ian Abercrombie\'s Emperor Palpatine (often a dead ringer for McDiamrid) - and what didn\'t is significantly improved, sometimes in a jarring way. One could argue that Anakin Skywalker is a completely different person here than in the films, and all the better for it. And most of all, the show was free to explore story-lines and characters too remote for the films, and is often at its best in these instances: a fun 4-episode arc around droids is a case in point.The greatest strength of the show, however, is its sense of wonder and pacing. Each episode begins ""in media res"", much like the original trilogy, with urgency and excitement, and rarely lets you catch your breath. Rather than let itself be handicapped by all the inconsistencies in the prequels, it forged ahead into exciting new territory.If you still have a little spark of Star Wars loyalty left in you, this could be exactly what you need to feel vindicated.', 'The Clone Wars is one of best animated shows I have seen, but I still had a problem giving this a proper score since the episodes are too much up and down. There are a few really bad episodes, a few boring ones, but also a whole bunch of amazing ones!There are 3 things that make this show shine above the rest; 1) It make the prequels look better because this show fills in all the blanks, give more extensive background stories and even explain the villains and Anakin and their motivation which was mostly lacking in the movies. 2) This is not really a kids show as some seem to think. This is pretty dark, there is a lot of war, a lot of deaths, and a lot of adult themes. Basically the only thing missing is sex, and perhaps squirting blood, otherwise pretty adult. 3) Ahsoka Tano! Nuff said!This show also feels fresh, it introduces a lot of new great characters, it explain a lot of question-marks from the movies and a few of the fight scenes (especially in later seasons) are absolutely stunning!This TV show produce more coolness, more badassery, and more amazing action in one episode than all 3 movies of the Mary Sue chronicles put together. BUT it does not stop there, this show has some of the best scenes ever done, in any medium, ever.The negatives are very few, but as hinted above it feels like there are too many filler episodes that have perhaps 1-2 necessary scenes and the rest could have just as well never been made since they fill very little function. There are also a few pretty boring episodes, especially in the first and 6th season. The animations during the first 2 seasons (especially) and here and there also later is neither at the very top. Feel too lifeless and computer created a lot of the times. Since the writing, character and world building is fantastic it does not bother so much, but still noticeable. But, contradicting myself, there is also absolutely fantastic looking scenes and fights (Maul VS Ahsoka!!) that make up for it.Music great, stories (except for a few filler episodes) are great, great characters with magnificent story-building leading up an amazing crescendo in season 7 which beat almost anything you can think of, and make this show automatically level up the prequels and even make Christensen go from a hated to almost accepted character.In the end I give this a 8/10 simply because I cannot forgive all the boring filler episodes. But if you only look at the great ones this is a 9/10 for sure. One of my favourites, and a great animated series. I highly recommend for everyone, but perhaps especially to girls because here you get several strong real women with real actual character development to love and have as heroes. That does not happen often so take note.', 'What an ending to one of the best shows I have ever seen in my lifetime. For someone who didn\'t even watch a single Star Wars movie this series was shockingly delightful and just a roller coaster.The visuals were way ahead of its time probably one of the best I have seen. The lighting, the character designs, the effects all were very well done. And such an amazing attention to detail on not only what\'s going on in front of the screen but the background as well. Each episode felt like a movie and I\'m not exaggerating. It had very good writing and it didn\'t feel cheesy or cliche and the voice acting was amazing. The sounds were absolutely amazing and you coudl tell they put a lot of work on that part especially the music which was astounding.This series had well though of themes that were also well represented such as Brotherhood, Friendship, and War. The series had an amazing story with respectable pacing and likable filler episodes which were good for the most part. Also one of the best worldbuidlings you will ever see with them going to different planets and meeting different aliens. It had a great set of characters which were well written and felt very original and you can easily contrast the difference between each of the main characters with great character development.Overall one of the best shows animated or not. WIth its amazing visuals and great sound composition comes it\'s delightful storytelling. Though it lacks in some parts such as some of the episodes not being in chronological order. And has some small plot holes and inconsistencies throughout the seasons.

I saw the first series (animated) and though it was good, it was rather a lead to Episode 3 with the kidnapping of Chancellor Palpatine (who, in my words, fixed it...) leading to his rescue in the movie...But this time, adding with the pilot of 2 hours (Anakin and Obi-Wan rescuing Jabba the Hutt's offspring), this is a far interesting series and follows canon as close as possible, and gives a foresight in the future of the Jedi Order and its possible demise...It was fun to see many characters added (like Ashoka Tano, Anakin's feisty Padawan...) but also some other familiar faces. A big surprise was the resurgence of Darth Maul (a satisfying improvement versus Episode I).And the Sith is well represented: the evil Count Dooku, its minion General Griveous, mercenary Asai Ventress, and the ever manipulative Darth Sidius, whom under the mask, reveals a rather discreet Chancelor Palpatine, as we never suspected he is holding all the strings to get absolute power...And for villains of different orders: Hutts, bounty hunters (like Bane), Boba Fett (without mask), pirates, rebels and all those whose want to use either the Separatists or the Republic for their own profit...And comes the Jedi: Yoda is in fine form, but we discover the differences between the rational Obi-Wan Kenobi (in whom we discover he was in love with Duchess Satine of Mandalore) and the emotional Anakin Skywalker, whose acts sometimes alter the balance of the duo (and sometimes the trio when Ashoka is around) and is a clue to his future as a sinister Dark Lord...For the last: the droids: Separatist droids of all sizes, deadly and fearful, but the best of all is R2-D2, which heroics of saving the day for the Republic goes farther than any of his buddies, including C3PO.A series to watch indeed and gives you insight about Star Wars..."", ""Star Wars the Clone Wars is an odd one, it's got some amazing, intriguing, lore expanding and thrilling episodes but also some of the most egregious filler and high amount of throwaway episodes.In general I really liked the this series, that said, I do highly recommend to watch it with a official star wars watch guide, so that you see all the episodes in chronological order, and not the original shuffled way they were broadcast. In addition, this is more of a personal preference but there are also some guides that remove the filler and in general bad episodes of which there are a few. I used that as well and still there was some ''meh'' here and there.But.. Season 7 came along. Luckily I just started watching this about a year ago and then S7 was announced so I never had a inconclusive ending or long wait. It definitely need that last season to solidify my rating. And the finale 4 episodes got a individual 9/10 from me because in all honesty, those are simply the best 4 episodes of the entire series. The music is amazing, the production quality it out of the world and it just feels like a fully fledged movie.That's not to say there aren't good or even great arc's in SW:TCW, for example the Umbara Arc is fantastic. Any lore expansion regarding the clones is just engrossing and adds so much more depth to the prequel films as well. If anything this show really provides a fantastic foundation for the prequels, which were made so complex and diverse regarding worldbuilding but with little explanation or depth.Now that said the show is mainly aimed at young adults or children, and it definitely shows with no blood, cursing or visual dismemberment. And to be asking for more would be misdirected. To me though, I still think it has some very effective moments of brutality and violence, but with it's PG flaws. The writing is simple as well, but effective as well. It's quite a simple show but it's got a lot of star wars, and that's good.Overall though the show is hit or miss, I've had to slog through some episodes and even skipped through some. The stuff that is good you notice though, and it engages you, that's where the show really shines.The animation and quality of the show is consistent, but you can definitely tell a season 1 episode versus a season 7 episode. Early in the series it was quite bland looking, but over time it became better and better.The artstyle I think is probably the best you can get for such an animation style. Rebels goes even more stylistic which doesn't always work. But in TCW it does work.All in all to any big star wars fan, especially if you are loving the mandalorian right now, this show is a must watch. But if you just casually like star wars, I'd skip it.7/10"", 'I decided to watch Star Wars for the first time in March if 2021. I wanted to watch it in timeline order, and watch all the cartoons as well. I am so happy I did. With the exception of Star Wars Resistance, they were great. But out of all the Star Wars I watched, I spent the most time with the clone wars. That is because it is so long, but it made me make a connection with the show, and some of the characters who aren\'t really in the movies. It is definitely my favorite animated show, and it is also one of my favorite shows all time.I loved so much about this show. I loved the characters, the writing, the animation, and the acting. Most of the characters in this show are characters from the prequel movies, with the exception of Ahsoka Tano. She made her debut in The Clone Wars movie as a young Padawan to Anakin. She developed over the span of 7 seasons, and 12 years to be some peoples favorite Star Wars character. She isn\'t my number 1 favorite, but she is definitely up there. She became so popular, she made a live action appearance in The Mandalorian season 2 episode 5, and is getting her own live action show that is a spin-off to The Mandalorian. Of course, characters like Anakin, Obi-Wan, and everyone else from the prequels were also amazing.I also have to give credit to the show runner, Dave Filoni. He had no experience with CGI animation coming into this show, and did amazing. Not only was the animation great, the writing of the episodes were amazing. The whole show involves the main characters doing crazy missions, and it all takes place in between ""Attack of the Clones,"" and ""Revenge of the Sith."" Until the final four episodes of this show that takes place during ""Revenge of the Sith."" A few seasons in, the writers started doing \'series of four.\' It is four episodes in a row that are all one story. It is basically one long episode split into four. Some of the \'series of fours\' were phenomenal. Especially the finales.Lastly, the acting in this show was amazing. This show used predominantly voice actors instead of their live action actors, and they were all perfect. Their tones and the way they spoke made it sound like the live action character. I have to give huge credit to the actors of Anakin, Obi-Wan, and Maul. Their performances in this show were phenomenal. Especially Maul. His voice acting in my opinion was better than it was in ""The Phantom Menace.""Like I said, this is my favorite animated show, and is one of my favorite shows all time. Everything from the acting to the way the characters developed together was just amazing. The ending of this show also couldn\'t have been written any better. I definitely recommend watching this show. I am extremely grateful that I did.', ""Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2003) was a series that was brilliantly made, and to be honest this one is even better. Its certainly more watchable, as this series contains much better visual effects and better animations. When this series first came out, I was thrilled. I immediately began watching it, and after watching the first episode 'Ambush', I realised how much GL has put into this. Unlike TPM and AOTC, this series is full of potential. The first episode proved how great this series can be, and to be honest, the episodes in Season 1 just got better and better.Season 2 was very well done as well, maybe using Obi-wan and Anakin a bit too much. General Grievous seemed to be proved as a much stronger character than in the films, and it was certainly a high. The voices were great, the animations were great as were the storyline.I'm very pleased to realise that these episodes begin with a voice introduction of what's going on, instead of the slanted sort of writing. Season 3 was nicely done, mainly the 'Savaga Oppress trilogy' and things got better.There is only one thing that I wish would be changed. I now believe Obi-wan Kenobi, Anakin and Ahsoka Tano are over used, and would love more of other Jedi, especially Yoda. The only reason, I deducted two stars was because of the overuse of these three Jedi. Other than that, its brilliant.""]"

In this one we SEE characters we love die. We see what it took to take down the empire.Our main hero Jyn doesn't get to live. She is a part of the giant picture and a part of what ultimately ends in the emperors demise.Basically all main characters of this movie die.An this is why this movie is so good."", 'This felt like an original trilogy movie. The characters are amazing, action is beautiful, and story is solid.', 'This had a ton of heart and story. Completely blows the new trilogy out of the water.', 'What has made Star Wars into the internationally recognized genre that it is today? Two things in particular - original material and a touch of humor/wit. Rogue One is a plethora of both. In addition, even in an area where previous Star Wars may have lacked (perhaps even overlooked, understandably), the acting is superb, top of the line. Forest Whitaker may be the most recognizable name in the entire cast, and he kills it every moment as his brilliant, rebellious character, Saw Gerrera. But he is merely the tip of the iceberg in what becomes an epic, near-perfectly written plot that connects episodes III and IV. It is haunting, it is funny, devastating, cheesy, and it is wonderful. It IS Star Wars.', 'In my opinion this is the best star wars movie ( besides the original 3 )The should have more stand alone movies like this .. especially the end is great', ""Without exaggeration, this is easily the best offering in the franchise since 'Return of the Jedi'. Yes, it is a spin-off of a simple set-up line from the original film, but it manages to really craft it's own story around the demands of where the plot has to go by the end. While it's definitely not a character driven movie, I was surprised with the amount of time given to our key protagonists and the effort to at least make them intriguing.The idea of another prequel movie was a hard sell; but unlike the prequel (and for that matter, the sequel) trilogy, this manages to tell it's own story within the structure of a lead-up to an event to which we already know the outcome. Felicity Jones and Diego Luna are especially effective along with secondary characters like those played by Riz Ahmed and Donnie Yen becoming easy fan favorites. Ben Mendelsohn is great as always as Krennic despite not being given much dimension as a main villain.The character of Saw Guerrera (Forest Whitaker) seems a little cut-up and while I understand the character is better informed by one of the animated series, what we have in the film seems like it may have been a little more beefed up in earlier edits of the movie.One thing I hear from people who don't care for this movie is the amount of fan-service moments. Random appearances of old characters or species, call-backs to famous lines and some easter-egg visuals can be a little distracting and if you don't care for that self-indulgent stuff, you'll definitely notice it here. Personally, it never really bothered me apart from one instance that lasts 5 seconds.On a final note, while the decision to include Darth Vader was inevitable for this movie, I was so glad to see they did a little more than give him a short cameo appearance and actually give him a moment or two without leaning on him too much as a crutch to distract the audience.If you love old Star Wars and couldn't care less about the two superfluous trilogies that followed, consider giving this a try."", ""This week I've decided to make a Star Wars' week. I watched all 8 episodes and the last two (7 and 8) left me feeling betrayed and utterly disappointed. Luckily, I still had to see this one and Han Solo film (I really don't know If I want to risk and watch the latter). Rogue One fits perfectly in the Star Wars saga, it has the feeling of grandeur, seriousness. Yes, there are some jokes but they don't make this film a farce like it happened to the 8th instalment. The main hero is a woman but she isn't annoying and she isn't a super human. Nobody is a super human, there is no place for magic and the laws of physics and the force aren't violated, as neither is viewers intelligence. The plot is simple but it delivers. The characters from older films are treated with respect. I give this film 10 stars because it is truly a Star Wars film. I was sitting on the edge of the seat and couldn't look away from the screen during the fighting scenes, they were so intense and spectacular . Thank you."", ""Rogue One is the movie we didn't asked for - but what we got was beyond any expectation. Excellent pacing of the movie. As the movie progresses it gets better and better. Culminates in one of the best finales seen in any of the Star Wars movies.CGI on the past main character seemed odd. But worked well on pilots and scoundrels. Many Easter eggs trough the whole movie are appreciated. Humor from Alan Tudyk's K-2SO was spot on.Empire Strikes Back is still king of the hill as the best SW movie till date. But Rogue One comes damn close near it."", ""The people who did this need to do the other ones. They aren't very good but this was perfect. They took a known outcome and told us the story of what happened. I have no complaints about this movie. Highly recommend it."", ""This movie brings back why we all loved Star Wars in the first place. For those who remember watching the original in the cinema long, long ago in a cinema far away....it's brings a tear to the eyes, how they recapture the classic imagination that JJ Abrams and Rian Johnson could not. Thank you Garth Edwards, you have given back the fun where others have failed. Johnson's 'Last Jedi' was just awfully bad."", ""Everybody who is a fan of 'Star Wars' will know that the rebels had acquired the plans to the Empire's new weapon; the Death Star\x85 this film tells the story of just how they acquired those plans and at what cost.As the film opens Imperial forces order scientist Galen Erso, who had been working as a farmer, to return to work on a new project. His wife is killed but his young daughter, Jyn, manages to escape. Fifteen years later news of the new weapon leaks out when an Imperial pilot defects while carrying a message from Galen. The pilot is held by a particularly radical rebel leader Saw Gerrera, the man who had helped save Jyn all those years ago. Jyn has lost contact with him but other rebels want her to help them get to Gerrera and learn the content of the message. Rebel officer Cassian Andor rescues Jyn from Imperial forces and they, along with K-2SO, a reprogrammed Imperial droid, go to Gerrera. By now the Empire is fully aware that a pilot has defected with a message and they will do anything to stop the rebels using that information. Jyn sees the message and learns that her father built a weakness into the Death Star\x85 but to use it the rebels will need to steal the station's blueprints from an Imperial facility. After seeing what the Death Star can do many rebels want to give up but Jyn, Cassian, K-2SO, the pilot and a few others decide that they will do what needs to be done whatever the personal cost\x85 and so a single stolen Imperial cargo ship, call sign 'Rogue One' sets off to find the plans.This is what the original prequel films should have been like. It is the darkest 'Star Wars' film to date; for once we see just how oppressive the Empire is; not just when dealing with rebels but as a brutal power of occupation. It also shows that the rebels are willing to do questionable things for what they see as the greater good of their cause. It might be thought there would be less sense of jeopardy as we've known for almost forty years that the rebels get their hands on the Death Star plans\x85 however since we haven't seen these characters before there the lingering question of why that might be\x85 is it just because they were doing other things or is it because they don't survive?! This question played on my mind throughout the film. As one would expect from a 'Star Wars' film there are plenty of exciting set pieces on a good variety of planets. The central cast are impressive; these include Felicity Jones, whose performance as Jyn I really enjoyed; Diego Luna who brings some believable ambiguity to the role of Cassian; and Alan Tudyk who provides the voice of K-2SO; one of the films best characters. The rest of the cast were pretty impressive too\x85 the only thing I was unsure about was the use of CGI to enable the late Peter Cushing to reappear as Grand Moff Tarkin and a young Carrie Fisher to appear as Princess Leia; the effects were pretty good but there was something of the 'uncanny valley' about them. There are plenty of enjoyably nods to the previous films; most notably some brief appearances from familiar characters; I also liked the nod to 'Zatoichi the blind swordsman' in the form of a blind Jedi played by Donnie Yen. I know that not everybody will like this but I really enjoyed it and would heartily recommend it to any 'Star Wars' fan."", ""With all the rumours flying about that Disney had interfered with the creative process on this one, just as when Alderaan blew up - I feared the worse. Fortunately my fears were unfounded. Rogue one is as engrossing as it is seamless and while its not perfect it had everything required to make a great movie. I guess everyone has different expectations of Star Wars. The plot which I will only briefly describe involves a group of rebels attempting to secure the plans to the Death Star, the designer of which, having a morale conscience, built the deliberate flaw (The exhaust port which Stewie Darth Vader asked about in Family Guy) so that it could be easily destroyed as long as the information fell into the right hands. This information is contained in an archive and it falls to the daughter of the designer, Jyn Erso, to not only restore her fathers name but get the designs to the rebels who are just itching to get on with events in Episode Four (New Hope) and blow the thing up.So does it hold up? Well, yes, not only does it hold up I would put this film on par with Empire and also Episode IV and this coming from someone who saw the first film on the silver screen in 1977. Gareth Edwards is a director who understands all the combined elements that make a Star Wars Film great. First a good script with the right mix of drama, action, pathos and humour and above all a story that actually makes sense, secondly good well written, rounded, characters that are interesting, diverse and unique, third great visuals - there's so many memorable shots in this film and so many of them are the shots you always wanted to see, fourth well directed action that looks and feels real, that is tense and that you can follow, fifth - tension, this film has it in spades, Sixth nods and references to the original trilogy - they come in abundance, some are comedic, some pure nostalgia while others are entirely appropriate and work so well within the story. Seventh - real sets, please give me a London Underground station redressed over bland CGI sterile sets any day of the week. Here the technology enhances the story and the tension and at no time tries to substitute for either. It is the perfect mix of live action & CG effects. I have not seen them so well combined since Lord of the Rings. This is a man who clearly understands his craft of what makes for a great film. I was highly critical of the prequel movies, which really are a masterclass in how not to make a film, here the total opposite is true. I am not a die hard Star Wars fan in any sense and was fully prepared to be very critical of this film, but find it hard to find fault in it anywhere. The supporting cast were especially good here, everyone from Riz Ahmed to Forest Whitaker giving it their all. The new villain of the piece is brilliantly played by Ben Mendelson (Hard to believe this is the kid from The Big Steal!) Donnie Yen's character was beautifully written, I could have watched another movie just about him alone. The cast feels truly international, as any universe should. Many British actors really make their mark in smaller roles including Duncan Pow & Ben Daniels as Rebel Foot Solider and General Pilot respectively while the likes of Sharon Duncan-Brewster & Jonathon Aris as Rebel Senators argue the merits of the attack in a tense conference debate - gone are the boring council meetings of the prequels. Strong drama is the key ingredient of the day. Here the Rebellion is shown as a far more tangible real faction, not everyone agrees with each other, things get messy and sometimes the wrong people are killed - the film even begs to ask the question, how better really are they than the Empire??? - we know of course, but its great to see such shades rather than just plain good and bad guys.The film contains so many pure Star Wars moments. I have no doubt the Droid (Voiced with skill by Alan Tudky) will become a favourite of many and new aliens and ship designs are not thin on the ground.Chiefly in the acting credits, plaudits must go to Felicity Jones who plays Jyn with real conviction while Diego Luna avoids a Han Solo portrayal of Cassian, her would be ally and sometimes adversary. The appearances of Vader and Tarkin (Incredible) are entirely warranted and in proportion with the rest of the film.One or two of the subplot characters are a little underwritten (perhaps deleted scenes and a longer cut will reveal them to be less so) but that really is nit picking, I had no issue with this at all. To juggle so many major and minor characters in a single narrative in a tight running time, for any director is no mean feat and Edwards manages it extremely well. I have no doubt Edwards had to steer an entire army of Executives in order to deliver the film he wanted. Perhaps one day someone will make a film about that? I have no doubt it would make for quite a story - Whatever were his obstacles, he clearly overcame them. He has done himself and every Star Wars fan proud. Pure class."", ""A scientist is forcibly recruited by the Empire to help build the Death Star.In my opinion Rogue One is (to date) the best Star Wars movie produced in the Disney era and one of the strongest entries in the overall franchise. I enjoyed it for its darker tone, excellent performances and in particular how well it fits into the overarching narrative of the Star Wars universe.There are a number of memorable scenes, particularly in the final act which packs a double emotional wallop with the fate of the main characters and what we know is to come in events portrayed in the original 1977 Star Wars movie.The action sequences and visuals are fantastic throughout, with a strong combination of great cinematography, sensible computer generated imagery and effective fight choreography. It's difficult to go into detail about the best bits without major spoilers so I'll just say they get the fan service spot on with a great blend of the old and the new.All performances are solid with Felicy Jones, Diego Luna and Alan Tudyk all compelling as the main antagonists. Riz Ahmed, Mads Mikkelsen, Donnie Yen and Jiang Wen give great support. The standout performances for me are Ben Mendelsohn as a memorable villain and Forrest Whitaker in a slightly unhinged cameo.Any fans of the original trilogy should enjoy this one, particularly when compared to the prequel and sequel movies which largely miss the mark."", 'The other recent Star Wars films were a little disappointing but this one lived up to expectations. It has excellent characters, story and battles. The filmmakers put a lot of effort into the settings and they all look like believable locations. It was gripping and tense all the way through.', ""Next step on the Star Wars review series is the first live action spinoff Rogue One: A Star Wars Story and this is my review for the film. The premise of the film sees a group of misfit rebels attempt to steal the Death Star Plans from The Empire.Main Character Felicity Jones plays Jyn Erso the lead in this film and she is really good in the role, her character has plenty of depth to her and you really support her as the main character. You see her really develop over the film and it makes her journey a fascinating one to watch and makes you care about her as a character.Supporting Characters This film has a huge supporting cast and Diego Luna as Cassion Andor is the main one, he introduces a new side to the Rebellion and it is great to see this more morally ambigous character associated with the Rebels as in the original trilogy they are presented as the squeaky clean heroes when it is clear there was more to them. Him and Jones has some good chemistry together and I liked how they interacted and how their characters develop during the film and bring out different sides to each other. Alan Tudyk voices the droid K2SO and he is the funniest part of the film, he makes you laugh plenty in the film but you also grow to care about him as he has more character then possibly any other droid in the Star Wars universe. Donnie Yen and Wen Jiang play Chirrut & Baze in the film and I really liked their characters, they have a really interesting dynamic together and I especially thought Yen's character was really interesting and a part of the most entertaining action scnenes in the film. Ben Mendelsohn plays the main villain Director Orson Krennic and he is the perfect Imperial in The Star Wars universe, he is very dislikeable and despicable making it easy not to like him, but it was interesting seeing his role in The Empire and how it affects him as a character.Story This film's story does a really good job of building the group and making you care about each of them, it also adds depth to them and develops them as characters. It is an exciting story and feels like a war film scenario where you care about the characters survival and want to see them succeed. Also this film does a great job in making A New Hope's plot better and adding more depth to it. However, my main criticism for the film is that the story isn't that interesting for the first act and jumps all over the place making it hard to focus on a particular journey but it improves as the film progreses.Script The script is great for this film, as mentioned it adds moral complexity to the rebels that makes them more human and more relatable to the audience. The drama feels very real and it adds to the emotion for the characters that you have especially in the last act. The humour is also well done mainly through K2SO but it was funny and felt appropriate for that character in the film.Style The film looks fantastic, the war like action scenes are brutal and exciting at the same time. Whether they are on land or in space they feel epic in scale and exactly how war should be shown in The Star Wars Universe. To help this film has possibly my favourite action scene in any Star Wars film and a film that kept me on the edge of my seat.Overall Overall, this is a fantastic Star Wars film, it feels like the most warlike film in this universe and does a great job showing the earlier stages of the rebellion and how the wheels are set in motion for A New Hope.Rating - 9/10."", ""I've just returned from the midnight showing of Rogue One here in the UK. I was slightly sceptical after watching Force Awakens, while enjoyed FA it did lack teeth and flesh.Rogue one was a great prequel to New Hope.We know that Princess Leigh had the death star plans but how did she get them ??.Well now we know.A few minutes into the film I felt disappointed that there was no Star Wars theme or rolling credits. Once I got past this the film started coming to life and put you right into the star wars universe. There were nudges to the originals everywhere, old characters from New Hope were brought to live to return to the big screen.There was plenty of visual eye candy here and a climactic ending that was truly stunning. I want to watch it again to see all the little details.This is a dark and emotional film compared to others but it has its light hearted moments also.Without giving too much away we follow a rag tag bunch fighting against the Empire and Lord Vader. A lost girl, a rebel agent, a defector, a novice trainee of the force, a hot shot gunner and a reprogrammed imperial robot. Alongside the rebel alliance they discover the existence of the Empires latest super weapon and must a find a way to destroy it. The Bad - 1.Some of the dialogue is wooden but this goes for all Star Wars film. 2. There is a lull in action about midway through and the dark scenes at this point may bore some people.3. No JediThe Good - 1. Amazing climactic ending a real visual treat.2. Ties in really well to New Hope.3. Interesting characters not your typical heroes which makes them more interesting.4. I got emotional at the end xIf your a fan of the originals then don't miss this film. My Star Wars marathon just got better ( and bigger )8/10 xx"", ""Rogue One is the first Star Wars film to be set outside the Episodic Sagas. With that, there was a lot of pressure on it to perform and launch this new series of Star Wars films.By far, this is the least kid friendly film. This was at it's core, a war film, something we have never really gotten in the Star Wars universe. With the war theme we got an overall darker tone than we are use to, and it really suited the story they were telling. We never have experienced the war side of Star Wars because the stories have always been focused on a force user rather than the events around them. Because there are no jedi, we got to see more of the Rebellion and the Empire and the battle that is taking place during the original trilogy.Offsetting the darker tone of the film, I thought this was perhaps the funniest Star Wars film. There are so many one liners and comedic moments that brings a lighter tone to the darker moments. I think much of the comedic moments came from the droid character K2SO. For the most part, he was the comedic relief and because of that, you are drawn to his character and is a stand out.While still on the cast and characters, I thought they were near perfect. While the characters themselves aren't as fleshed out as we get during the saga films, for the role themselves, they served their purpose. Apart from K2SO, I thought Donnie Yen's character, Chirrut was a close second standout. I really enjoyed his character because of his connection into the Star Wars law.How much you enjoy Rogue One is, for the most part, going to depend how deep you invested you are into the world of Star Wars. As someone who read Cataylst in the lead up to Rogue One, I felt as though my experience during this film was enhanced so much. There were so many moments that was so much meaningful and heartfelt because I knew the backstory to some of these events and characters. There is also a lot fan service in Rogue One that on paper, it seems like it's too much. But what stood out was that not one of the fan services felt shoed in. All of it felt like it had a place in the movie and should of been there regardless of if it was a fan service moment or not.Walking out of this film, you are going to be on a high and that is because of the fantastic third act this film has. Rogue One has a third act that will rival that of Return of the Jedi. This is one of the best space battle I have ever seen. While I love the one in Return of the Jedi, personally I rank the opening battle from Revenge of the Sith above it. However, the space battle in Rogue One beats them all. It had the feel that Return of the Jedi brought in their space battle but with the action and visual effects the space battle in Revenge of the Sith.Stepping back from the space battle, the third act has a terrific ground level fight. This was where the war tone was heavily present. This was a scene we see in a WWII war film but with a Star Wars skin. There's no better way to describe it, and that is a good thing. What really enhanced the war toned ground fight was how well it was edited between the action happening on the ground and the spectacle of a space battle happening above them.I have to mention Vader. While he isn't in it all that much, when he is, his presence is felt. Without giving so much away, his final scene is perhaps one of my favourite scenes I have ever seen. The short scene alone rivals the Airport scene in Captain America: Civil War for me. It is so exciting that it has the capability to make any major Star Wars fans cry with happiness.Overall, I loved this movie. This did what it need to do and prove that they can make Star Wars films that isn't all lightsabers and Skywalkers. But what this film does the best is enhance A New Hope. As soon as I walked out the cinema I wanted to go and watch A New Hope. Personally, I really struggle with watching A New Hope but with Rogue One it makes me excited to go back and watch the original Star Wars.9/10"", 'Of course that sounds like heresy but in fact I will go one further and say that it IS the best star wars movie ever made.

Let Gareth Edwards take over the sinking star wars ship.', 'Long ago, when I had a poor understanding of the cinematographic universe, when the plot of films was deeply indifferent to me, I saw a wonderful film in which the hero escaped in the belly of a dead unknown beast, and giant metal elephant-turtles walked along the snow-covered planet. And, I did not think that these feelings can be repeated in adulthood.Unexpected discovery: Rogue One, one woke a child in me, although the plot was clear, and there was no infantile desire to jump into tact with gunfights and fights. It was just great. It was just a classic trilogy, elevated to the absolute. It\'s just the same as many years ago. And, what is very important, without any hidden pathos, without an obsessive director\'s ""wink"" in the style of ""well, you realized that this character returned and everyone giggles and applauds.""So, Rogue One, of course, is a fresh look. This is another camera work. These are other perspectives and, as was rightly noted in trailer analyzes, this is an amazing work with scales. The director and the cameraman made things that you believe in. You believe in the size of the Death Star. Believe in the size of the Star Destroyer. And, okay, it would be one thing: launched a comparative infographics, and finished on that one. No, here all objects of space are constantly involved in some kind of action. The Death Star moves, the Destroyers engage in battle, the transport workers, fighter jets and bombers are fighting alongside. This is a ""wow"", this is ""super"", this is the star thriller we wanted. The fighter in which the fighters actually shoot down the enemy, and the bombers cause point torpedo strikes, where the technique creates a real cover, and not just ""hanging around for the crowd"", as in the Awakening of the Force. And, yes, this is the very setting of the fights that was in the original trilogy. I am delighted. This is a new operator\'s view of the old scale of star battles.The next moment is the preservation of the style of Lucas. Here everything pleases not less. This is a city similar both to Naboo I episode and Tatooine IV episode. This is nature, similar to what we saw in the second part (during the rapprochement of Anakin with Amidala), or on Kashyyyk with its battles in the woods. Everything looks natural and beautiful. There are no eared adherents of the dark side, wading through unnatural winter forests, built on an old 3D engine. The whole environment looks beautiful, relevant, familiar in the atmosphere. It seems that this is called landscape design.The plot of the film is not snotty, does not shine with pathos. Everything happens naturally. Heroes look vital, at first glance, there is no logic. The actors also played very well. Emotions want to believe, the motivation is clear.VII episode of the Star Wars exported at the expense of the name. If you remove the name, you will receive a parody of the IV part with comical physics and a trash story. But Rogue One is a terrific epic saga. One of the best films in the universe of Star Wars.', 'Nothing worthwhile comes without sacrifice, and the superlative science fiction saga ""Rogue One, A Star Wars Story"" exemplifies this notion. Basically, ""Godzilla"" director Gareth Edwards, ""Golden Compass"" scenarist Chris Weitz, and ""Bourne"" trilogy scribe Tony Gilroy have eliminated all those buffoonish, kid-friendly aliens primarily Jar-Jar Binks and given adults a chance to experience an unusually Spartan ""Star Wars"" saga. No, the PG-13 rated ""Rogue One"" is neither ""Saving Private Ryan"" nor ""Hacksaw Ridge,"" but the straightforward action will give you a reason to shed a tear since a palatable sense of doom looms over this skullduggery. Everything I\'ve read about this entry in the ""Star Wars"" universe emphasizes the word \'stand-alone\' so you won\'t be seeing the gifted cast, featuring Felicity Jones, Forest Whitaker, Donnie Yen, Ben Mendelsohn, and Diego Luna, reprising their roles unless Disney conjures up prequels. Of course, this doesn\'t apply to Darth Vader who behaves like the ruthless ruffian that he has always been. Mind you, in some respects, ""Rogue One"" may seem hopelessly predictable for some aficionados. If you\'ve seen George Lucas\' ""Star Wars: Episode VI: A New Hope,"" then you know that the Death Star didn\'t survive that adventurous classic. ""Rogue One"" qualifies as a prequel. Chronologically, this outing takes place between ""Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith"" (2005) and ""Star Wars: Episode VI: A New Hope."" Although we know the Death Star is ill-fated, what we didn\'t know the identity of the individual who sowed the seeds for its destruction. Some of the finest moments in ""Rogue One"" occur when the Grand Moff Tarkin appears. This is the infamous character that the late British actor Peter Cushing of ""Frankenstein"" fame portrayed with such ascetic villainy. Cushing\'s estate approved the physical recreation of the late actor\'s personage, and actor Guy Henry\'s impersonation is flawless. Quibbles aside, if Peter Cushing could see what they\'ve accomplished, he\'d be impressed. Similarly, what Edwards and his scenarists have achieved with Disney\'s audacious attempt to expand the ""Star Wars"" time-line is sensational. Indeed, the House of Mouse has succeeded where few film studios have ever gone with a legitimate spin-off from a multi-million-dollar franchise.Since ""Star Wars: Episode VI: A New Hope"" came out back in the summer of 1977, fans have complained about the sweet spot in the Death Star that enabled the Alliance to blow it up. ""Rogue One"" relates the story about that sweet spot, and ""Star Wars"" aficionados can argue about other things—primarily the time-line between the two films—because Luke and Leia were born at the end of ""Episode III."" Nevertheless, who really cares about such things, when a movie like ""Rogue One"" fills the gap? Aside from Darth Vader, C3PO, R2D2, and Princess Leia, the primary characters in ""Rogue One"" are entirely new to the franchise. A brilliant scientist, Galen Erso (Mads Mikkelsen of ""Dr. Strange""), has been forced against his will to collaborate with the Empire to forge the ultimate weapon of devastation. The wicked Orson Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn of ""Killing Them Softly"") has commandeered Galen for the project, and he intends to use Galen\'s wife Kyra (Valene Kane of ""Victor Frankenstein"") and his adolescent daughter Jyn (Beau Gadsdon) as bargaining chips. Galen sends his daughter into hiding, and Kyra perishes trying to thwart Orson. Jyn grows up under the tutelage of an extreme radical, Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker of ""Platoon""), and she becomes a notorious criminal who has been imprisoned when the Rebel Alliance rescues her. It seems that an Empire pilot, Bodhi Rook (Riz Ahmed of ""Nightcrawler"") has defected and given himself up to Saw. Bodhi insists that he has an urgent message from Galen Erso about the Death Star. Naturally, nobody believes the Empire could have forged such an awesome weapon. The Rebel Alliance isn\'t prepared to be so casual about this booger bear. Captain Cassian Andor (Diego Luna of ""Blood Father"") and his reprogrammed Empire Droid K-2so (voice of Alan Tudyk of ""Serenity"") break Jyn (Felicity Jones of ""Brideshead Revisited"") out captivity when she is being transferred to a labor camp. Later, as Jyn explains to Saw, the Rebel Alliance is using her for safe passage into Saw\'s camp on the planetary moon Jedha where Bodhi is being held captive. Saw surprises Jyn with a holographic message from Galen intended for her. Galen explains that the Death Star has the equivalent of an Achilles\' Heel that will render it vulnerable to the Rebels. No sooner has Jyn seen this message than the Grand Moff Tarkin brings the Death Star into orbit around Jedha and unleashes its formidable power on the city. During their rushed exit from Jedha, Cassian and Jyn pick up a pair of hitchhikers, Chirrut Îmwe (Donnie Yen of ""Iron Monkey 2"") and his sidekick Base Malbus (Wen Jiang of ""Let the Bullets Fly""), who become recruits for the cause. Chirrut is a blind martial arts warrior who wields a lethal staff and believes in the Force with all his heart.""Rogue One, A Star Wars Story"" depicts the efforts of the underdog Rebel Alliance to triumph over the Empire. Basically, this exciting escapade works on the level of a Republic Serial from the 1940s with one cliffhanger scene after another ensuing in a grand finale on a scenic Caribbean-like island named Scarif where the star fleets of the both the Rebel Alliance and the Empire wage the battle to end all battles. Although it doesn\'t rely on the usual troika of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Princess Leia, ""Rogue One"" imitates ""Star Wars"" in virtually every respect except its ending with a Pyrrhic Victory. Felicity Jones makes a sympathetic heroine that you won\'t forget. Donnie Yen and Alan Tudyk as K-2SO compete as the ultimate scene stealers. The special effects are stellar stuff. Altogether, ""Rogue One"" qualifies as the best ""Star Wars"" epic since ""The Empire Strikes Back.""', ""What a return to form for Star Wars! I've seen this twice already and the second time was pretty much as exhilarating at the first. It's not just 'not crap' - it's actually great, and the first time in a while I didn't want a movie to end.I won't go into the story details. Star Wars fans should know what this is about and those who aren't fans are a bit hopeful by this point in time if they think watching the latest one will change their minds. Those who are somewhere in between are more likely to enjoy this than the prequels.Episode 7 had promise but Abrams' movie fell short. He fixed the issues that everyone had been griping about since the prequels, except that he brought a bunch of new ones instead (like too much pop culture and forced attempts at comic relief).Rogue 1 is really well written. There's such a huge difference between this and the prequels, or Episode 7. The story manages to stay interesting and coherent throughout, without glaring contradictions to itself or the rest of the franchise. The characters become interesting quickly, and you do end up giving a damn about them by the end of the film.Like kids in candy stores, Lucas and Abrams both made these movies with too much new technology at their disposals and too many potential ideas flying around; restraint was required on both their parts. Gareth Edwards, on the other hand has managed to get the ingredients right and, dare I say it, takes the franchise to a few new places.Rogue 1 is not the powerhouse of a movie that The Empire Strikes Back is but it does offer, ironically, A New Hope for the Star Wars universe."", ""That rarity, a decent Star Wars film. Apart from this one all the most recent movies have been poor This feels like a return to basics, a return to it's roots. This is my favourite, after the very first/original movie."", 'The film begins with the traditional text: A LONG TIME AGO IN A GALAXY FAR FAR AWAY... but instantly leaps to the action, omitting the opening crawl.In the early years of the Galactic Empire, we see an Imperial ship landing on the planet Lah\'mu. Jyn Erso (Beau Gadsdon) sees it and runs to warn her father, Galen Erso (Mads Mikkelsen) and mother, Lyra Erso (Valene Kane) . Lyra calls Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker) and tells him that ""He\'s come for us"". Galen says goodbye to his daughter and tells her that he loves her, calling her ""Stardust"", as he heads off alone to face the Empire. Jyn and her mother run to the foothills behind the farmhouse. They stop and Lyra asks Jyn if she knows where to go, meaning that Jyn is to proceed on her own. She then takes off her necklace, which has a clear crystal orb on it, attaches it around Jyn\'s neck, and as a way of saying goodbye tells her to ""Trust the Force"".Outside, Galen meets Orson Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn), a high-ranking Imperial military officer, who tries to get Galen to come back to work for the Empire. He asks about his family and Galen lies that his wife is dead. When Orson tells his stormtrooper bodyguards to check the house, Lyra appears and draws a weapon on Krennic; they have a standoff. Lyra shoots Krennic, hitting his arm, and is killed. A stormtrooper toy is discovered and Krennic tells his guards to find Galen\'s daughter (who stayed out of sight but witnesses the incident). Jyn runs away and hides in a prepared bolt-hole under a rock in a cave. Saw Gerrera eventually finds and rescues her.Fifteen years later, in the Ring of Kafrene, an adult Jyn (Felicity Jones) is held in a cell. Meanwhile, commanders of the Rebel Alliance, led by Mon Mothma (Genevieve O\'Reilly), a senator of the Old Republic Senate-turned-Imperial Senate, discuss the Empire\'s plan to create a giant weapon capable of destroying entire planets.On the planet Jedha, Bodhi Rook (Riz Ahmed), a pilot who has defected from the Empire and wants to join the Rebels, arrives and is apprehended by the local forces there.On the planet Wobani, Jyn is being transferred with other prisoners. Suddenly, Rebel forces break in and free them. Wanting to escape, Jyn attacks the Rebels and tries to flee but is stopped by K-2SO (voice: Alan Tudyk), an Imperial enforcer droid who\'s been re-purposed to work for the rebellion.On the moon Yavin 4, the location of the Rebel base of operations, Mon Mothma and other Rebel leaders talk to Jyn about her father. She says that she last saw her dad 15 years ago. The Rebels also question her about Saw Gerrera and tell her that he is an extremist causing problems in Jedha. The Rebels say that finding Saw and the captured pilot is paramount to find out what the Empire is plotting. They offer her a deal: find Saw, and she is free to go. As Jyn boards the ship taking her to Jedha with K-2SO and the pilot Cassian Andor (Diego Luna), Cassian is told to kill their target (Galen Erso) and not perform any extraction.At Jedha, Bodhi is confronted by Saw, who now has prosthetic legs and uses a supplemental oxygen mask. Saw doesn\'t believe Bodhi\'s story and interrogates him harshly, eventually bringing in a Bor Gullet, a tentacled creature that terrifies Bodhi and can apparently read his mind.Aboard an Imperial Star Destroyer, Krennic discusses with Grand Moff Tarkin (Guy Henry), the Imperial governor of the outlying areas and overall commander of the Imperial Navy, the ""ultimate weapon"" they are creating. Krennic urges that they perform a test of the weapon.Meanwhile, Jyn, K-2SO, and Cassian arrive at Jedha. K-2SO is told to wait at the ship, and while Cassian scouts the area, Jyn is approached by Chirrut Imwe (Donnie Yen), a blind warrior who notices her necklace and the quality of the stone. Later, when Jyn and Cassian roam the city, they notice snipers and the area quickly erupts into a battle. Rebel and Empire forces fight and, while Jyn and Cassian take care of the stormtrooper, K-2SO arrives and defeats the last set of stormtroopers that arrive on the scene. As they leave the area, they run into another squad of stormtroopers who want to detain them. Chirrut tries asking the stormtroopers to let them go but is attacked by the stormtroopers. Showing excellent skill despite his visual impairment, Chirrut defeats the stormtroopers with a little help from Baze Malbus (Wen Jiang), but they are captured by Saw\'s crew.While Cassian, Chirrut, and Baze are in a cell, they quickly notice that Bodhi is in the cell next door. Jyn is brought directly to Saw. Saw is surprised to see Jyn, but Jyn instantly confronts him about abandoning her when she was 16. Saw replies that he did it to give her her best chance and suspects Jyn of being told to head here to kill him. Jyn says that she wants nothing to do with the rebellion at all. On board the the new weapon, Tarkin makes the decision to test the station\'s superlaser on Jedha and a course is plotted to go there.Saw shows Jyn a hologram sent by her father. Her father says in the message that he went with the Empire to give the rebels their best chances and that the weapon they were building is called the Death Star. He says that he made a fail-safe in the death star by placing a trap within it that will cause a chain reaction, destroying it. He also apologizes to a tearful Jyn and tells her to fight for him and to finish what he started: ""Save the rebellion and save the dream.""Suddenly, the Death Star attacks Jedha, firing the station\'s superlaser onto the surface and destroying millions of square miles. Chirrut, Bodhi, and Baze head to the ship while Cassian gets Jyn. Despite Jyn\'s help, Saw acknowledges his weakness and tells her to leave him. Everyone else escapes in the ship with K-2SO while Jedha is destroyed and Saw is crushed to death.With their test successful and Jedha gone, the Imperial leaders rejoice. However, Governor Tarkin decides to claim all the credit, shutting out Krennic as director of the project. Tarkin threatens further action against Krennic should he protest against his or the Empire\'s policies.On the ship, Cassian is secretly given instructions to kill Galen if they find him. The people on the ship discuss Jyn\'s report of the hologram but, as she left it behind in Jedha, there is no proof to convince the Alliance. She convinces them, however, to head to Eadu to find Galen.On Eadu, an Imperial mining planet with constant darkness and rain, the crew crash-lands their ship. As Cassian and Bodhi head out, Jyn questions Cassian\'s motives. Upon hearing K-2SO say that Cassian\'s weapon was in sniper mode, she heads out, followed by Chirrut and Baze.Nearby, at the Eadu Mining Facility, Krennic is interrogating Galen and six other engineers working for the Empire because he believes one of them is secretly working for the rebels. When Krennic threatens to kill everyone, Galen steps forward and confesses. Krennic still kills the other engineers. While this is happening, Cassian has his rifle sights on Galen but, eventually, does not pull the trigger.Meanwhile, Jyn has climbed a long ladder to the platform where Krennic and her father are. Jyn calls out to her father just as rebel forces arrive in X-Wing fighters and cause an explosion and a fight. When she regains consciousness, Jyn finds her father in critical condition. She tearfully reunites with her father before Galen passes away and Cassian pulls her from his body as they head out of Eadu.On the ship, an angry Jyn questions Cassian on his motives and he replies that everyone has lost something for the rebellion, and that she only truly started to care because of her father.Krennic arrives on the planet Mustafar and reports to the Emperor\'s chief enforcer, Darth Vader (Spencer Wilding and Daniel Naprous; voice: James Earl Jones). Krennic believes he deserves to meet directly with the Emperor to talk about the station\'s completion and destructive potential. Vader becomes agitated, having heard the reports about Jedha and Eadu, claiming that the space station has begun to cause problems and that utmost secrecy must be maintained. The destruction of Jedha will be attributed to a mining accident and Krennic must investigate further to see if Galen Erso had compromised the security of the station in any way. When Krennic asks if he\'s still in charge of the project and if Vader will speak to the Emperor, Force-chokes Krennic for a few moments before stalking off.At a meeting back on Yavin 4, the rebel leaders, among them Senator Bail Organa (Jimmy Smits) and General Dodonna (Ian McElhinney), are doubtful of Jyn\'s story and her credibility. Jyn proposes to infiltrate the Empire\'s data storage facility on Scarif and get the plans for the Death Star, ending her argument by saying rebellions are built on hope. She fails to get approval, as Mon Mothma opposes any strike against Scarif and the other rebel leaders agree it\'s too risky. Senator Organa then leaves to travel back to his homeworld of Alderaan to have a talk with his adopted daughter to try to help and seek out a former Clone War veteran who may help out the Alliance.Outside, Cassian approaches Jyn about the mission -- a dozen other rebel fighters have decided to join them. With their crew in tow, they use the call sign \'Rogue One\' and head to Scarif to find the Death Star plans themselves.At Scarif, Bodhi uses his old Imperial passwords to get through the gate in the force field that protects the planet and get permission to land. K-2SO, Jyn, and Cassian head into the facility to get the plans while the other rebels plant explosives around the landing pads on the perimeter of the facility\'s island atolls. Director Krennic arrives on Scarif around the same time to review transmissions involving Galen Erso as well as Governor Tarkin.The rebels quickly detonate explosives all over the island. With a full-on battle emerging, the rebel fleet arrives -- the leaders had a change of heart. (There\'s a cameo scene of R2-D2 and C-3PO in which C-3PO comments on the rebels going to battle.) The rebels\' first challenge is to slip through the gate in the force field before the Imperial forces close it and block their access to the surface of the planet.In the access room for one of the storage units, Jyn and Cassian enter the data storage area to find and extract the plans to the Death Star while K-2SO stays back by the console to help with the search and guard their backs. While they search for the plans, K-2SO fights off stormtroopers. They eventually identify the plans under the code name of the nickname Jyn\'s father gave her -- Stardust. When they find the files, K-2SO notes the force field and tells them to deliver the plans by getting the physical media themselves -- it\'s in a structure that\'s designed to be accessed by mechanical arms -- and then climbing all the way to the top of the tower to transmit the data. Stormtroopers then overpower him, and K-2SO dies, permanently locking the door to the control room with Jyn and Cassian inside -- where Krennic has spotted them.Outside in the battle, the rebels are able to take down several AT-AT\'s, and Bodhi manages to find a way to the control switch to turn on communications. He is unable to turn the switch on during the battle, so Chirrut risks his life, walking over to the switch and turns it on. He is, however, shot on the way back and dies in Baze\'s arms, telling him that he will always be one with the force.In the data storage area, Jyn and Cassian do some dangerous jumping and climbing to grab the cassette holding the Stardust file, but they\'re intercepted by Director Krennic. Although they take out the stormtroopers and shoot Krennic, the wounded Krennic shoots Cassian (who falls), while Jyn narrowly escapes. Bodhi gets communications working and notifies the fleet that the force field has be be disabled for the information to be transmitted. He is killed by a grenade bomb thrown by a stormtrooper as he finishes. Baze is inspired by Chirrut\'s sacrifice and fights until he is also killed by a grenade bomb held in the hands of a fallen stormtrooper.Jyn finally makes her way to the top of the tower and sees the command console for transmitting data to the rebels. The console prompts her to re-calibrate the antenna, and she does, not knowing that Krennic is headed up. The tower is hit by shots from a duel between rebel and empire fighters and Jyn nearly falls off. Jyn tries to send the data but is intercepted by Krennic. He claims that she will die and her rebellion will die with her but a surprisingly alive (though heavily injured) Cassian appears and shoots Krennic, who falls.Above the planet, the Rebel fleet engages several Imperial star destroyers. When one is disabled, Admiral Raddus orders a Corvair Hammerhead to force the ship into another star destroyer, which plummets into the gate, deactivating the shield, allowing transmissions off the planet. Jyn starts the transmission, sending the Death Star plans to the Rebels. As the plans are received, the Death Star arrives from hyperspace. Governor Tarkin watches the carnage from the space battle and aims the Death Star at the base on Scarif.While Scarif is about to be destroyed, the Rebel fleet retreats to note the sacrifice of the Rogue One. Jyn and Cassian, having transmitted the plans, hold hands and embrace on a beach as the beam obliterates them and the facility.On board Raddus\' ship, the Rebels frantically copy the plans to a data card. The ship is boarded by Darth Vader himself, who ignites his light saber and effortlessly wades through a squad of Rebels trying to stop him, deflecting blaster bolts and using the force to shove them aside. The plans are passed to another rebel soldier behind a jammed hatch. As the last of the squad are massacred, a smaller ship, Tantive IV, is launched and speeds away while Vader looks on.On the Tantive IV, the data card is brought to the bridge by Captain Raymus Antilles, where a familiar figure clad in white receives it: a young Princess Leia (Ingvild Deila, voice: Carrie Fisher). When asked what was sent, the Princess only smiles and answers ""Hope."" Tantive IV jumps to hyperspace.']"
11,Star Wars,Solo: A Star Wars Story,3778644,"['So I am of the generation who got to experience Star Wars feom the beginning. Standing in a crazy ling line, literally wrapped around the local theater back in 1977 as a kid. Totally unaware I was about to see a movie that would become my central interest for all my childhood, early teens and once again as an adult. And all these years later, able to share this fandom with my own son. I liked Solo. I wouldn\'t say it\'s my favorite but it was a fun ride and it evoked the feelings that I associate with Stat Wars. The world and characters felt right. It showed us some cool new things about life in that world, living under the Empire. The amazing cityscapes of Corellia... It felt similar to me to Rogue One. Modern filmmaking techniques yet convincingly evoking the vibes of the classic Star Wars world. Anyway, I just wanted to put in some positive review for this movie to contrast this strange wave of hate feom ""fans"" on here. I don\'t really understand it. I have liked something about every Star Wars movie there has been. Some are better than others. There are weaker moments in every one to be sure. But none are worth the irrational seeming hate some people are putting out there. Solo is good and worth your time if you like Star Wars. Just one fan\'s opinion.', ""For anyone who feels discouraged by the reviews, I tell you this: They're not complaining about the movie, they're complaining because they feel abused by a continous stream of movies from a beloved franchise. It seems ironic, I know, but having nothing for so long and suddenly watching different posters every six months, has to be confusing and bound to raise some eyebrows. However, we have to look at it as objectively and simple as possible: If you love movies, you want to watch as many movies as you can. And if you love Star Wars, you love to experience the Star Wars' story! So all of this backlash for having so much of the thing you love is simply a tantrum that I hate to see on so many of my fellow Star Wars' fans.This a very well made film that anyone can enjoy. Plot, acting, FX, Photography, Cast, etc. They did a great job with everything. Taking into account the enourmous pressure of making a film from such a historical franchise, I take my hat off for anyone who has the bravery to do this.So, go and watch it, not with skepticisim, but with that natural feeling of curiousity and love you have every time you sit at the movie theater. I promise, you'll be pleased."", 'I liked Solo.... much more than I anticipated I would. Like many people posting reviews, I am an old-school, die-hard fan of the original trilogy, and I am also a fan of the old ""extended universe"", much of which is now being overshadowed by the cash-grab that is this new Disney-driven galaxy.However, I must say that the negativity this film has received is undeserved. The story is solid, if a bit predictable at times. The dialogue and acting are FAR better than in any of the other recent Star Wars films, except perhaps Rogue One. Notably in comparison to Last Jedi, the story has a logical flow, there are no side-stories that make no sense, nor any ham-handed attempts to milk humor out of an unrealistic scene. I can\'t say it enough, this movie actually makes sense and has a believable story.If there is a problem, it is that Star Wars is becoming another Marvel Universe, where everything has already been done in one way or another. For non-star wars fans, this will be a perfectly serviceable action/sci-fi adventure, with characters whose struggles most people should recognize from other stories in these genres. I was pleasantly surprised at how some characters were killed- it actually made me worry that anyone could be in danger, even knowing that this was impossible. It was emotionally real.For Star Wars fans, there are heaps of references to the extended universe. These were done in a way that made sense and gave service to old Star Wars stories. Teras Kasi, Aurra Sing, Chewy being ~200 years old, among others. There are glimpses at what the every day life of an average citizen in the empire would experience (spoiler: not nice). Han as a character is played true to form: a guy who has seen some bad things, done some bad things, but still, deep down, is good.I liked it. Don\'t listen to the fanatical homers whose own self-absorption with Star Wars prevents them from enjoying anything that doesn\'t conform to their pre-determined view.', ""They steal from people, but people seem willing.Every single review that is positive justifies it by saying 'it is better than the new trilogy' That may be true, but it still doesn't make it a good movie.It is dark on screen (bad digital rendering?) and looks like a 1970s heist movie.What does it do with Star Wars? $$$$$"", ""Disney excels at it.Having said that, throw us a bone.

With Empire Strikes Back and Rogue One, my favorite in the series.As for the movie itself, my opinion is that it\'s a solid adventure movie, in the style of the great Indiana Jones movies, with lots of fun and intense action, witty dialogues, great humor and solid acting from all actors. Yes, Han must meet a certain Wookie, obtain a certain spaceship and meet a certain curly hair character to maintain coherence with past movies, but the ""necessary"" scenes, even if expected are still brilliantly developed. On top of these scenes, there are several surprising scenes that run the gamut of the best of what the Star Wars universe offers: chases, spacecraft battles, shootouts, aliens galore and lots lots of anti laws of physics split-second solutions.Still, my favorite take from this movie is that they finally managed to shoot an amazing movie that is far from the epic good-evil battles of previous Star Wars movies, and this is completely in tune with the Han Solo character (and, btw, I think Alden Ehrenreich is a perfect match for the role).In summary, if you think the movie is ""unnecessary"" and not needed, it will indeed disappoint you and I would advice you not to watch it, but if you go to watch it with a no-expectations open mind, I think you\'ll be greatly pleased and much entertained.(and my excuses for any English mistakes; my mother tongue is Spanish)', ""They should stop making all the adaptations of Star Wars and just retire the franchisee .

I feel YouTube Star Wars parodies movies make more sense than this one.', ""As expected, the film has been met with huge criticism, which in my opinion is wholly unjust and just another opportunity for so called 'star wars' fans to voice their disapproval for Disney. Solo is not the biggest and boldest SW feature by any stretch, but it is true to the original trilogy material without resorting to overly complicated plots, ropey CGI effects and forced comedy. It provides action , excitement, great dialogue, romance and a vast array of alien creatures (that were lacking in Rogue 1) and genuinely feels like a SW film, albeit with an interesting western inspired spin. Its Star Wars with everything we love about the saga. If you hate it.. perhaps its time you realised you might not be a SW fan after all."", 'Each part of the new serie is , for me, new motif for understand I am too old for it. all seems be a pretext for new easy show. all is so, so superficial. and all was said, in smart way. so, maybe, just a new generation, ignoring the original serie, could be the target. the film has few virtues. but it has not a story. it reflect a decent effort for be the correct prequel of original story. but nothing seems coherent . or credible. or more than a sort of parody/ homage ( ? ) to western. sure, impressive images. fights, slices of humor, Chewbacca as savior of appearences and the end as gift. nice presence of Woody Harrelson. technology used in fine manner. but a Star Wars represents more. and the big problem, for a 42 years old , like me, is real simple: except Harrison Ford, nobody can be a reasonable Han Solo.', 'This and Rogue One are my favorite Star Wars movies. Alden Ehrenreich is so good in this movie as Han Solo. Love the whole sequence of him trying to escape the planet with Kira at the beginning. One of my favorite scenes in Star Wars is when you see Han Solo fighting on the side of the Empire on MImban. Some of the best 7 minutes in Star Wars. The whole Kessel Run sequence is good just not my favorite. The 3rd act is unique with a shoot out in a small room. Love the twist with Enfys Nest that Han actually kinda started the Rebellion. Stand out characters include Han, Chewie, Lando, and Tobias Beckett. Love the whole Conveyex robbery scene. Love new Star Wars vehicles and troopers and some standouts include heavy Tie Fighter, Conveyex, imperial At hauler, Mud Trooper, Mimban Trooper, and Range Trooper. Just such a fun ride and the pace is so good.', 'Gone is the time when an aloof and mysterious character like Han Solo can stand on his own. When the pure imagination of fans opened up countless debates on how the Kessel run really went down, or how Hans eventually won the Millennium Falcon and eventually became a staple of his character. The hard truth is, fans and casual viewers already knew these milestones in Han\'s story happened and will happen, so the only thing that mattered about this movie was, how was it going to happen? For awhile, the magic of Star Wars was that of not knowing what to expect and getting to analyze an entire lived-in universe by yourself or with your friends throughout the years. With Solo, that magic is lost. You know you will be dealing with limited stakes since Solo and Chewie are pretty much okay and surely alive after this movie. You know that it will hit the basic story beats of how he becomes an outlaw, a rebel and eventually the iconic smuggler with a secret heart of gold we all know and love. You know he\'ll get the Falcon, you know he\'ll end up with Leia anyway. There\'s no mystery here, everyone knows the answer and we\'re all left with awkward suspicions about how things will play out. Alden Ehrenreich does a, for the most part, fantastic job as Han Solo and he makes the role his own, probably one of the better parts of this movie. Lando (Donald Glover) and Chewie both get their moments, and also stand out in their roles. Beckett (Woody Harrelson) and Qi\'ra (Emilia Clarke) weirdly fall flat as the new additions for Solo, aside from an obvious wisecracking droid to entertain us and give us some emotional moments, the two side characters that are meant to be the people that influence the title character are bland and uninteresting. Beckett seems to be just a ticket for Han to go follow him wherever he goes only to just ride backseat in the mission in the end. While Qi\'ra plays the love interest of Han who we never get to know much about aside from pointless and explicit exposition. She also has a vague and messy arc that makes not just Han, but the audience confused as well. At one point, you\'re not sure where her allegiance lies, what her motivations are and what drives her to stick or stay away from Han. Moreover, the story really doesn\'t aim to tell a properly structured narrative, instead it felt like a ""Han\'s Biggest Hits Montage"" all through out. Now this is not to say that it\'s hard and impossible to tell a proper movie about iconic persons/events we probably know about and/or have learned about and theorized ourselves. Rogue One (2016) was able to do it to an admittedly better extent, and quite masterfully in the James Bond reboot with Casino Royale back in 2006. To use Casino Royale as an example, it\'s a perfect story that shows how James Bond became THE James Bond we know and love, the commanding, suave and rough 007 agent. When the movie starts, he\'s not yet quite the Bond we\'re used to know yet, but what happens in that film contributes to why he changes. Then in the end, that\'s the only time we get the iconic line of James Bond introducing himself because that character has earned it through the context of the film.  While Solo tried to achieve this same level of success, it falls hard on its knees really hard in the process. The definition of ""context"" the filmmakers had in mind with Solo was just throwing in fan service after fan service of what made Han Solo iconic, but we never really see why THIS character in THIS film in particular earned that iconic status. Han is basically the same person from the beginning till the end, compare this to James Bond in Casino Royale wherein his relationship with Vesper and how it ended changed his character forever, inevitably giving strong emotional and narrative context as to why he became how he is. This is never explored in the film and it instead becomes a by-the-numbers, monotone, and dull looking film.Verdict: 6/10', ""This is the most uselessly written movie I have ever seen in my life; If this wasn't a star wars movie it would have zero stars. Questions are brought up, several times and not answered and question are answered that no one asked! It is so void of emotion when Han and Chewie meet just a complete mess that makes less sense than the endless Ghostbusters and Charlie's Angels."", ""Wow, some people are never pleased. This movie was enjoyable to the very end. How can anyone who is remotely interested in Star Wars not enjoy can entire movie dedicated to Han and Chewy??? And this wasn't a cheap production either. The best part is Disney kept their political agenda relatively at bay with this film, unlike the main saga films. So refreshing and rare these days. HAN IS THE MAN!! (and Chewy)"", ""None of the new films will ever hold a candle to the original 3. And this one is no acception, ok it puts a few things from the old films to bed. Where was the rogue Han Solo in this he was a full in hero which I thought took away from it. Didn't think it was good at all they need to step up their game."", ""Good Origin story not just made up for fans, took my girlfriend to see it who has not seen any star wars films and she understood and enjoyed it. Defiantly a recommendation ( don't listen to the haters) and can't wait to the sequel for it."", 'In this second \'Star Wars\' stand-alone, spin-off film, it opens with the traditional ""A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away.....""Across the known galaxy during the early years of the First Galactic Empire, organized crime syndicates are running rampant due to rampant lawlessness on the mid and outer rim worlds since the fall of the Galactic Republic, forcing others to fight for survival. On the industrial ship-building planet Corellia, Lady Proxima (voice of Linda Hunt), leader of the White Worms gang, is after a hyperfuel known as coaxium. Meanwhile, one young man seeks a way out of Corellia for good.That man is Han (Alden Ehrenreich). After getting his hands on some coaxium, he meets with his girlfriend Qi\'ra (Emilia Clarke) as they plan to escape. They are found by some of Proxima\'s minions and are taken to her, where she demands the coaxium. Han takes out a rock that he pretends is a thermal detonator and throws it at the walls to bring in sunlight, which Proxima and her species are allergic to. Han and Qi\'ra run and evade the worms as they chase after them, managing to lose them after Han gets them through a tight spot in the wall with a stolen speeder, but they end up stuck and have to continue running on foot.At the nearby spaceport, Han and Qi\'ra evade Imperial storm trooper guards and bring the coaxium to a female Imperial officer as a bribe to help them escape. They nearly make it to freedom until they are spotted by the worms again. Han is able to make it out, but Qi\'ra is captured. Separated by a security gate, Han promises to find a way to get her out. Now on his own, Han decides to enlist as a pilot for the Empire. He speaks to a recruitment officer, and he asks Han his full name. When he can\'t give him a surname, and when the officer sees he is alone and has no family, he dubs him Han ""Solo"".The story jumps ahead three years...Han is fighting on the muddy, foggy planet Mimban as an Imperial infantryman -- he has since been kicked out of the Imperial Flight Academy for insubordination. Most of the fighters on his side are killed, but Han manages to find three thieves posing as fighters - Tobias Beckett (Woody Harrelson), his girlfriend Val (Thandie Newton), and the alien Rio Durant (voice of Jon Favreau). Fed up with constant conflicts, Han wants to join them after telling them he\'s a good pilot, but Beckett refuses to let him join, even after Han threatens to blackmail them. Beckett sets Han up to be arrested, lying to some Imperial officers. Han is taken by guards and thrown into a pit to be fed to a beast. The beast turns out to be the Wookie Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo). He attacks Han, but when Han reveals he can speak the Wookie language, they decide to work together to break out. Han uses Chewie to break the beam that\'s keeping them bound together, collapsing the ceiling and spilling the two guards that threw Han into the pit down to the floor. The two escape and see Beckett, Val, and Rio leaving on a ship, hoping to have caught a ride. Rio manages to convince Beckett to bring the two on-board since the immensely strong Chewie could work well as extra muscle.The crew rests for the night on the snow-covered planet Vandor before their upcoming job. As they sit around a campfire, Val figures that Han has joined them for a girl. Beckett tells Han that they are trying to steal a large amount of coaxium from a train for the people they work for. Beckett disassembles a DL-44 blaster rifle he\'s brought with him, stripping it down into a pistol that he gives to Han.The next day, the crew spots the train and they go in for the heist. They find the coaxium, but they are attacked by a gang of Cloud Riders. The crew fights them off, but Rio is shot as he flies the ship overhead, forcing Han to pilot the ship. Rio then succumbs to his wounds. Val is at the end of the tracks just over a cliff where the Cloud Riders ambush her. To ensure they don\'t get the others or the coaxium, she blows herself up with the tracks, causing the train to plummet to the ground. Han also ends up dropping the coaxium, realizing that the craft isn\'t powerful enough to yank it away from the Cloud Riders. The coaxium explodes, collapsing a big portion of the mountain.Beckett leaves memorials for Rio and Val, and he punches Han in the face for ruining the mission. They were supposed to deliver the coaxium to a criminal named Dryden Vos (Paul Bettany), leader of the Crimson Dawn syndicate. Without the coaxium, Beckett fears Dryden will kill him. Han offers himself and Chewie to help Beckett find another stash of coaxium and reach a new deal with Dryden. Beckett reluctantly agrees to let Han and Chewie come along.The three travel to Dryden\'s huge, luxurious ship docked nearby. While attending a lavish party, Han spots Qi\'ra, who has been working for Dryden for the last couple of years. After the ruthless Dryden kills the regional governor in his private room, he steps outside to speak to Beckett and meet Han and Chewie. After discussing what happened with the coaxium, Han suggests that they steal unprocessed coaxium from the mines on the planet Kessel. Dryden has Qi\'ra join them. The danger is that unprocessed coaxium is highly unstable and must be taken to a refining facility quickly before it explodes.In order to get a ship to travel to Kessel, Qi\'ra brings the three to meet the charming smuggler Lando Calrissian (Donald Glover) as he is playing a card game of Sabaac against other alien pilots. Han challenges Lando to a game, where the winner gets the other\'s ship. Han appears to poised to win, until Lando cheats, using a card hidden in his sleeve to outmatch him. Still, Lando joins Han and the others on their mission for the potential profits that would follow. They stop to get Lando\'s droid friend, L3-37 (voice of Phoebe Waller-Bridge), who is watching a fight between other droids and is upset to see that they are used like gladiatorial slaves. Lando brings them to his ship, the Millennium Falcon, and they take off for the mining planet of Kessel.The team arrives on Kessel and heads toward the mines, having to navigate the large, stormy cloud that surrounds the planet. L3 initiates a riot by freeing captive droids, which allows the others to find the coaxium and take it. At the same time, Chewie spots imprisoned Wookiees, and Han allows him to go and free them. An all-out battle begins as the team tries to escape, only to be shot at by the creatures. L3 is blasted, and Lando runs in to save her, losing her lower half, and he is wounded trying to take her back to the Falcon. The team gets the coaxium on-board and they fly away, where L3 dies in Lando\'s arms. As the team flies out, they are found by an Imperial star destroyer blockade that sends out TIE fighters to attack. With Lando injured, Han must pilot the Falcon to evade the TIE fighters and make it through the Maw, a cluster of black holes. They are attacked by an enormous space monster that tries to devour them. Han must then do a ""Kessel Run"", but Lando points out nobody can do it in less than 20 parsecs. Using a piece of L3\'s machinery to navigate the ship, they find themselves being sucked toward a black hole, which the space monster falls victim to as it is ripped apart. Han then has Beckett use a small dose of coaxium to boost the Falcon out of danger. It works and they fly out, and Han is able to brag that he made the Kessel Run in 12 parsecs.The team is set to meet with Dryden on the planet Savareen, where they plan to process the coaxium at a disused refinery. The group are soon found by the Cloud Riders. Han tries to bluff them, saying he has a small unit of soldiers waiting aboard the Falcon. The ruse fails when Lando flies off in the Falcon. Beckett believes the Riders are a bunch of marauders, until their leader, a teenage girl named Enfys Nest (Erin Kellyman), reveals herself and says they only want to keep the coaxium out of Crimson Dawn\'s hands. A resistance is building in opposition to the Galactic Empire and Nest wants the coaxium to use in the fight.Han, Qi\'ra, and Chewie bring the coaxium to Dryden who\'s ship lands nearby. When he sees a sample, he says that it is fake. It turns out Beckett was his inside man, and he told Dryden that Han had been planning to sell the coaxium to the Cloud Riders. However, Han reveals he took a page out of Beckett\'s book and anticipated that Beckett would betray them. The coaxium in the room is real, and the Cloud Riders have nothing. Beckett takes Chewie hostage, along with the coaxium. Dryden fights Han and Qi\'ra, ending with Qi\'ra overpowering Dryden and stabbing him through the heart with his own blade. Qi\'ra tells Han to go after the coaxium and to save Chewie, and she will join them soon.Han catches up to Beckett. Beckett attempts to talk his way out of the situation and draws his gun, but Han shoots first and kills Beckett. Meanwhile, Qi\'ra contacts her true boss... a shadowy figure who reveals himself to be Darth Maul (Ray Park). She tells him of the mission\'s failure, and he assigns her to Dryden\'s former position. She leaves on Dryden\'s ship, passing over Han and Chewie. She looks over to him, and he looks back.Han gives the coaxium to Enfys and her team. She offers him a chance to join them, but he declines. Enfys leaves Han and Chewie with a vial of coaxium for themselves.Han finds Lando and challenges him to another game of Sabaac, only this time, he manages to swipe Lando\'s cheat card from him before the match. Han wins fairly, and he gets the Falcon. Along with Chewie, they decide to head to Tatooine after Beckett had mentioned a gangster (Jabba The Hutt) putting together a crew for another mission. Han then puts the Falcon into hyperspace as they take off.']"

The camera work is not so good, some parts is good but others it feels like a Michael Bay film. The action sequences are pretty intense and excessive.

The music names of the movie that I really love is:Flight Sent here for a reason If you love these people What are you going to do when you're not saving the world?Look to the starsJust beautifully pieces in my ears.

G U T S ⭐ .', 'Hands down the best Superman movie out there. Way ahead of its time.', 'At first I was very nervous at the prospect of another Superman movie. Especially considering how horrible ""Superman Returns"" was; however, ""Man of Steel"" was a roller coaster of a ride as we not only witness Kal El\'s (Clark Kent\'s) origins, but we are shown Superman the way he is supposed to be.With expert direction brought to us by Zack Snyder and the assistance of Christopher Nolan, ""Man of Steel"" is packed full of action and emotional depth. No Superman movie has ever come close to achieving the atmosphere illustrated in the comics or the cartoon series until Zack Snyder\'s ""Man of Steel"". Sure it has a lot of action, but anyone who is a true Superman fan knows that Kal El\'s battles were almost always explosively long. Furthermore, the biblical metaphors were absolutely brilliant! As Superman was intended to be portrayed as a ""Christ Like"" figure, you see his journey in ""Man of Steel"" not all that much different from the New Testament. (Ex: When Clark Kent asked the priest for advice, behind him was a stained glass window of Christ praying to His Father before He was arrested and crucified. Next scene Clark Kent willingly submits himself to be arrested, ascends into the ""heavens"", and than descends in a crucified form) As Superman\'s story is not about becoming the best, but an immigrant facing the challenge of home VS heritage, we see Zack Snyder\'s portrayal of Superman reflect the ""Man of Steel"" originally designed by Joseph Shuster. Furthermore, who could forget such actors like Henry Cavill (Clark Kent),or Amy Adams (Lois Lane). Every actor in this movie left their mark, but I needed very little convincing to believe that Cavill was the face of Superman, or that Adams could be a persuasive Lois Lane. And although I am not particularly a fan of Michael Shannon, he was the perfect General Zod. With the level of ferocity Shannon provided, not to mention his one liners, this was by far his best role yet!This movie soared through my expectations and it will be the first time I ever give a Superman movie a perfect 10!', ""So we are looking at essentially a remake of Superman (nothing wrong with that). So how does it compare? Favourably.The original is perhaps a little softer, more romantic and more idyllic whereas the remake is darker, richer and a little more interesting.2 changes that worked for me, the origin part of the story on Krypton which is much more expansive (creating more of a universe feel, literally) and the extended character of Superman Senior. Brando was the quintessential sci-fi 'head in a bottle' character using him to explain Supe's back story in the original, Crowe's character came full combat ready and I think it added well to the overall story.Really enjoyable effort that sits well as a representative of the DC universe :)"", ""Snyder's start of the DCEU is an underrated flick with beautiful cinematography and boverwhelming action sequences. Costner as Pa Kent is a very good choice, Cavill as Superman can't live up ti Reeve's approach, but is still a very good choice. Negatives are the choice of the villains for a first part, because Superman should be the only kryptonian for at least one movie, and the choice of having Superman kill a villain, also right in the first movie. These choices are too far away from the Superman of the comics. But if you move away from these 2 points you get an interesting approach on kryptonian life, a nice Smallville, good Snyder-visuals and superb action. Lois Lane is also well chosen and the villains are very good portrayed, even if they would have been a better choice for a second or a third part. The too rushed moving forward of the dceu just started here in this very first movie of the franchise."", ""I love Superman. Every version. I'll defend Superman 4 if you want? But this is the definitive version. The version I've always dreamed of seeing - the version I'd write if I could have. Challenging, thought-provoking, insightful. Not there to be a poster child, but rather to be an inspiration. Inspiration comes through internal struggle and strife, not through BANG BANG, POW POW. I wish DC had more faith in this storyline - cause it was clearly going somewhere wonderful. #ReleaseTheSnyderCut."", ""With Zack Snyder hosting a watchalong tomorrow and Justice League coming to Netflix next week I decided it was about time to catch up on my DCEU films starting with the Superman origin film Man Of Steel. The premise of the film sees a young man who finds out he is an alien with special powers as he must stop members of his race from destroying his new home of Earth.Main Character Henry Cavill plays Kal El/Superman and I think he is great in the role, to start off he really looks the part as Superman, he is very believable in the role and does a great job. Through flashbak scenes and his cureent day story you see his character really develop, I think the issue in the past is that Superman has been seen as above humans which makes him hard to root for and that is here but he just feels more human. He seems to be on the back foot for the majority of the film and as it's his first days on the job he struggles throughout which helps build his character.Supporting Characters This film has a legit supporting characters, Amy Adams plays Lois Lane in the film and I thought she did a good job, she is a pretty strong independent character and her relationship with Superman feels more mature then the average comic book romances and feels appropriate for this film. Michael Shannon plays General Zod and he was a great villain in this film, he is menacing and strong but also has interesting motivations that made him a memorable villain for me. Laurence Fishburne, Kevin Costner & Russell Crowe have smaller but memorable roles and really add something to the film.Story The story is a really interesting origin story for Superman, it looks at how the world would really react to a superbeing if they came to Earth in an effective way. The flashbacks documenting his earlier life do a great job of fleshing this part of the story and really adding dome emotion to the characters and the film. The characters motivation's are all well done and as mentioned seeing the average person react to Superman this way is really something we haven't seen before. Now there is something that happens towards the end of the film that has proven controversial amongst the fandom but I thought it reall worked effectively if you accept this is a new type of Superman for a new generation.Script The script has some great drama in it, it deals with things in a more complicated way then you would accept in a Superman film but it works very well. Though I will say this film is incredibly somber, there is pretty much no humour at all which feels weird in a Superman film and sometimes the dialogue is a bit rigid but overall it does a decent job.Style This film's style is the most action packed of any Superman film ever, the action scenes are really exciting and fit the God like characters really well, there is plenty of destruction but it fits the story well and can lead to stories in the future.Overall Overall, this is a fantastic origin film, it takes Superman in a different direction and does a great job in setting up a future for the character.Rating - 9/10."", ""This movie was dishonestly mauled by critics and reviewers simply because it was directed by Snyder. Watching this again in 2020, I have to say this will go down as a classic in years to come. It's an absolute blast from start to finish and is true to the Superman lore in the DC comics. Just one of its greatest achievements was the world building of Krypton, giving Zod gravitas and motivation you could actually felt empathy for and what an amazing portrayal by Shannon.I remember people actually complained about the level of destruction in this movie and the excessive use of special effects, but for me this is what makes a Superman movie. Take off your nostalgia tinted glasses and watch this with an open mind. This is the greatest Superman movie bar none."", ""I never had the opportunity to see this film in theatres, though, after my first viewing at home, I was instantly blown away by the tone, visuals, soundtrack, story, performance, thriller and action to this film.Man of steel truely felt as though it was an alien invasion film set in our present time.Superman has literally searched to find himself and when he does, he must learn not only learn his origins, though his abilities and how to use them.He was bound to question himself and make mistakes along the way and following his journey is something I'm extremely excited for.Most certainly a superhero film for adults."", ""This re-imagining of the most famous of all superheroes takes some liberties that on first view may offend long-time fans of the alien turned protector of all mankind.Jor-El's sacrifice to save his only son, born under miraculous circumstances, before their home planet is destroyed by its misuse and exploitation takes centre stage in the first third of the film. Where Richard Donor's versions took three instalments to introduce the Kryptonian prisoners from the Phantom Zone, Snyder's take uses very intelligent shorthand to give us a view of the villian before he even meets Superman.We don't even meet the Man of Steel (never called that throughout the movie) until the third act.Through the perfect use of flashbacks, the second act takes us on the journey Ckark himself takes to find out who he really is. Meeting Lois as he finds a decades-old scout ship from his home planet, we learn as he does that this Pulitzer prize winning reporter is a force to be reckoned with, and she does not stop searching for him until she's in his arms. And just as Act Two brings them together it ends with the introduction of General Zod and a whirlwind Act Three that leaves you breathless!To say Zack created an epic is understated. This ode to cinema deserves every award possible! The acting, the score, the action sequences, the scenery and its destruction has no equal in Superhero films and maybe ties with LOTR in pure visual crispness!The story told may not be the Superman we grew up with, but it's a biblical tale told awesomely anew bringing new awareness to sides of the lore we may have previously taken for granted. From the Kent's love and loss, and Kal-El's connection with them, through the dilemma of coming out of the alien closet to public fear or acceptance, to the power of goodness that lives inside the man who chooses to be Super for the benefit of others.The amount of visual cues of the wider DC universe is a nerd's dream come true. The people from Smallville, the small details in satellites and jet planes to names mentioned in passing, together points to a multitude of possibilities to extend the story beyond Clark's!If you cannot believe a man can fly, nor run faster than a speeding train, or jump a towering skyscraper in a single bound, then this film will make you believe, so grounded in reality, and an absolute absence of tongue-in-cheek, it brings the comic book best seller into the modern world, and even highlights its deficiencies!!"", ""I think this was the last superhero movie I liked.

Totally recommended.', 'As usual, I find that for some when a movie is made about a super-hero, it has to fit into some pigeonhole, determined by years of comic books. God forbid that someone tries to find a different angle or a new approach. As usual, there is all this nit-picking about details that don\'t seem real. For heaven\'s sake, the guy can fly, comes as a baby from another planet, and can go back and forth in time. Let\'s check the reality thing right now. There have been so many reviews of this that I doubt I can contribute much that is new, but for me, the guy was a multi-dimensional character who has to deal with a hand that is dealt to him. I\'m waiting for Superman XIX, ""Superman on the Psychiatrist\'s Couch."" The guy must have incredible angst during his private moments and feel the weight of the world. Anyway, the acting is quite good, there is lots of action, and under the circumstances, he seems pretty real.', ""Man of Steel is an incredibly epic origin story for Superman that's emotional and action packed, even though there is a little too much destruction in the third act.

The depiction of Krypton is perfect and the best in a live action or animated movie. The relationships are so well established and the backstory is brilliantly depicted while we see the struggles and progressions of Superman in real time.

Sure, it's not a perfect movie, far from it, but I got excited all the time."", ""A modern and updated take on Superman, man of steel is thrilling, thoughtful and incredibly rich and vibrant. The opening krypton scene alone is worth the price of admission and is absolutely breathtaking. There are complaints from people too stuck in the past to get over Christopher Reeves. Complaints of pacing, and too much action. Clearly these people have never read a comic, this is the definitive comic book movie because it plays out like a comic, how can any TRUE fan not love that? The cast is Phenomenal, Henry Cavill is the physical embodiment of what the Superman of a modern age should be. He's thoughtful, compassionate and selfless, yet feels wildly out of place and yearns for acceptance and to find his place in the world. And he just looks like he could demolish a skyscraper with one punch. Shannon is fantastic as Zod, the tyrannical general consumed with Kryptons resurrection. Crowe shines as Jor-El, the guiding hand and hopeful father of Kal, I only hope we get to see more of him in future stories. Costner is great as the voice of caution, the worried parent desperately hoping to keep the world from taking his son away for being different. All in all this is a fantastic movie, we even get glimpses of a more self assured and even cocky Superman when he allows the authorities to handcuff him and the scene with the drone at the very end. If only the studios would have stayed out of things and allowed a true sequel to come organically, rather than push to catch up with Marvel. At least now with the Snyder cut coming, we may get to see that."", ""This is what I've been waiting for my whole life - a Superman film that tackles big issues, big ideas and takes risks. I've liked every superman film I've ever seen - but this one felt like it finally lived up to the potential of the character. 11 stars if I could."", ""Pretty underrated movie I like this one the villain is kinda cool too I actually like this movie it's not the best but it's pretty good like the story of Superman."", ""I am old enough to have seen the original 2 Christopher Reeve Superman movies, and the idea of combining them is great. Henry Cavill is a better Superman, Amy Adams is a better Lois Lane, the script is far stronger, the baddies are more believable, I honestly can't understand the negatives; with the exception of the first 20 minutes, which just didn't work. A great attempt, far better than most DC movies, except the Nolan ones."", ""When the trailer came out for this, I was so stoked. Hans Zimmer's score gave me chills and I couldn't wait (still one of my favorite soundtracks). I also remember leaving theaters a little shocked at how different it was and thinking I didn't love it. Never thought it was bad, just not great. Years later after all the other DCEU movies that came out, this is my favorite one in retrospect. Cavill looks good with the suit on, and I can see what Snyder was aiming for."", ""Caution: spoilers may abound. I think this movie is severely underrated. Most complaints I see are of people who can't let go of the vision of superman they got from Christopher reeve who played a superman who was a god among men who never made mistakes and always knew what to do. That's not someone we relate to in this day and age because in our cynical and jaded society it's impossible to be that morally upright. I like Henry Cavill's superman because he plays a man who has to learn how to be superman. He's not perfect out the gate and he doesn't automatically know how to handle every situation right out the gate. Because of this a lot of lives are lost in the battle of metropolis and superman is forced to end zod because there is no other recourse because there is no way to contain him on earth with all the kryptonian tech is destroyed. Whatever you can say about how believable it is that superman didn't have a choice it's still set up well. Krypton was very beautiful and Russell Crowe made a great jor el. As far as the plot for the movie I understand the criticism that the flashbacks don't make sense but I think the death of Jonathan Kent is done very well because it's a sacrifice intended to keep Clark undercover. All in all its not perfect but it's far from terrible."", 'On the Planet Krypton, Lara-El (Ayelet Zurer), is birthing a son, Kal. Kal is a secret because he was born naturally, instead of by genetic engineering.Jor-El (Russell Crowe) tells the\nKryptonian council that the planet started crumbling and is on the brink of destruction. They forbid him to evacuate the planet\'s Codex, claiming that the planet is stable.General Zod (Michael Shannon) and numerous followers, attack the council. Zod invites Jor-El to join the coup, considering he disagrees with the council. When Jor-El refuses, Zod orders the arrest of Jor-El who escapes.Jor-El swims in the incubator chamber and takes the Codex. Lara prepares the small spacecraft he has built to evacuate their son from Krypton.Jor-El races home to put the Codex in the spacecraft. Lara feels difficulty separating from her son but Jor-El comforts her that they are preserving his life by sending their baby to: Earth, where the yellow sun will cause greater strength and speed. Jor-El places the Codex into a device that bonds it to his son\'s living cells.As they prepare to launch the pod containing their son, Zod and his followers force their way into the Els residence, demanding that Jor-El hand over the Codex. Jor-El claims it is in the pod with his son. Zod becomes enraged and attacks Jor-El, eventually stabbing him to death. During the fight, Lara engages the pod\'s engines and it shoots into the sky.Angered that Jor-El and his wife have doomed the Kryptonian race with the removal of the Codex, Zod orders his followers to shoot down the pod. However, his orders are suddenly canceled when Kryptonian security ships appear, destroying the attacking vessel and arresting Zod and his minions. In the confusion, the small craft\'s propulsion engine, a Phantom Drive, engages on the pod, rocketing the baby away in the blink of an eye.Zod and his followers are banished to The Phantom Zone. In a fury, Zod lashes out, declaring the leaders will not grant him and his followers a quick death. He also swears to Lara that he will find her son. Zod and his followers are placed in a giant craft, the Black Zero, that is sent into the Phantom Zone.Shortly after, Krypton\'s core collapses as Lara passively watches the planet breaking apart. Many worlds away, the pod carrying Kal-El rockets into Earth\'s atmosphere, touching down somewhere in the Great Plains of the United States.The scene then shifts to ocean waters, where we see a bearded man working aboard a fishing vessel and having trouble concentrating on his duties. The crew are soon alerted to a distress call for help from a flaming oil rig. The bearded man quickly disappears from the ship but is on the rig moments later, rescuing the crew and getting them to board a Coast Guard chopper. The crew are astonished to see him tear a steel door from it\'s hinges and that the flames he\'s covered with do not burn him. Kent is unable to join them, as he rushes to keep a part of the rig from collapsing on the landing pad. As the chopper flies away with the rig\'s crew, the rig collapses down on him and he ends up floating in the water.We soon learn that this is Clark Kent (Henry Cavill), as in a deep mental state, he recalls when he was younger, and manifested X-Ray vision, and super-hearing. The overload of images and sounds caused him great pain. Scared at what he was seeing and hearing, Clark runs from his classroom and locks himself in a closet. His mother, Martha, comes to the school and manages to coax him out, helping him to focus his powers, quelling the myriad sounds he hears.Back in the present-day, Clark has managed to return to land and steals some clothes. As he attempts to figure out where he is, he sees a school bus nearby. Clark has another flashback to when he was 13. He recalls being picked on by a boy Peter (Jack Foley), before the school bus they were on suddenly blows a tire, and careens off a bridge into a river. Thinking quickly, Clark escapes out the rear emergency door, and pushes the bus to shore. Clark jumps back into the water and pulls Peter to safety.Though Pete\'s mother claims that Clark miraculously saved the occupants of the bus, Clark\'s father (Kevin Costner) tries to convince her otherwise. Needless to say, Clark feels even more conflicted, as his father has tried to tell him to suppress his powers, but Clark was torn by a need to help others.When Clark demands to know what\'s wrong with him, Jonathan shows his son the pod he came to Earth in, hidden below the barn. Along with the pod was a strange metallic item. Jonathan claims he had a metallurgist examine it, but it is comprised of elements not found on Earth. Imprinted on the small fragment of metal is a shield-like shape containing an ""S"".The scene then returns to the present day, where Clark has a job at a truck stop in Canada. As he works, he hears some military men talking quietly about some object found in the ice a ways north of the stop. When a trucker comes in and starts harassing one of the waitresses, Clark attempts to stop him, but afraid others will see his powers, stands there and takes the trucker\'s taunts. Without saying a word, Clark takes off his apron and leaves the stop. Later, as the trucker leaves, he is shocked to find his rig impaled on several of the large logs he was hauling.The scene then cuts to Lois Lane (Amy Adams) landing at the base in Canada, where she is met by Dr. Emil Hamilton (Richard Schiff), and Colonel Nathan Hardy (Christopher Meloni). Drilling is still commencing within the ice to get to uncover the craft, but drilling tests have at least confirmed that the ice surrounding the object is thousands of years old.Going out in the evening to shoot some pictures, Lois is shocked when she checks them to see a man walking on a ridge near the drilling site without cold-weather clothing. She sneaks up to where he was, and finds a tunnel bored into the ice. The tunnel is Clark\'s doing, as he had followed the word of the military men, and made his way to the site, using his heat vision to create the tunnel through solid ice. He then finds a strange spacecraft, and going inside, finds a panel that opens up. It contains a hole that seems to match the shape of the object his father found with him in the pod. Inserting the object the hole causes a person to suddenly appear nearby. He doesn\'t say a word, simply walking off. Clark attempts to catch up to this person, but he always seems to be several steps ahead of him.Meanwhile, Lois has found her way onto the ship, but is attacked by a sentry. Her screams reach Clark, who finds her. After dismantling the sentry by crushing it with his bare hands, he sees that the sentry has wounded Lois in her lower abdomen. He tells her she\'s bleeding internally and uses his heat vision to cauterize the wound. Shortly after, military forces nearby are all amazed when the ice starts to crack and a giant ship emerges, flying off.Lois is found the next day and shortly thereafter she writes up an article about what she experienced. However, her editor at the Daily Planet, Perry White (Laurence Fishburne), refuses to publish it. Even the Pentagon has denied her \'aliens and spaceships\' story. Lois then attempts to play hard ball. Going to a contact of hers named Glenn Woodburn (Chad Krowchuk), she allows him to publish her story. Though he cautions that she could get in trouble for leaking the story, she claims she hopes that it will catch the attention of the person she met.Meanwhile, Clark has piloted the spaceship to another remote location in the Arctic. It turns out the figure he was following is a hologram of his father Jor-El, who is appearing via the \'key\' Clark inserted into the ship. Jor-El explains the history of the planet Krypton, Zod\'s attempted coup and that the ship Clark found was a sentry ship sent out many years before, when the the council of Krypton had sought to colonize other planets but abandoned the project.Jor-El shows Clark a dark blue and red suit bearing the shielded ""S"". Jor-El explains that it is the emblem of the House of El and a symbol of hope. Jor-El also explains that the Earth\'s sun has made Clark stronger than human beings, and has been helping him manifest powers for some time. Jor-El tells Clark that the suit will symbolize his mission: to help the people of Earth and act as their guardian. Stepping outside the ship, Clark begins to push his powers: first taking flying leaps, before eventually being able to fly at great speeds, breaking the sound barrier and flying great distances around the world.Back in Metropolis, Perry is furious that Lois leaked her story to the internet, and suspends her for three weeks. Lois uses this time to begin tracking down leads to her mystery man. Her sleuthing leads her to Smallville, and eventually, Peter.Visiting the grave of Jonathan Kent, she is surprised when her mystery man appears (albeit in nondescript clothing). Lois claims she wants to tell Clark\'s story, but he tells her of how he abides by his father\'s request to not reveal himself until the world \'was ready.\'Clark then relates how Jonathan died. After the two have an argument during a drive, which mostly concerns Clark\'s frustration over his true ancestry and how he is forbidden to reveal his powers to anyone but his parents, they stop when a tornado forms, threatening everyone on the road nearby. Clark gets his mother and several others to safety, with Jonathan attempting to get the family dog free of their vehicle. The dog makes it out safely, but Jonathan suffers an injury to his ankle and is unable to make it to the overpass where everyone has taken shelter. Clark had wanted to help his father, but a gesture from Jonathan cautioned him to not reveal himself, leaving Jonathan to be swept away by the tornado. Hearing his story, Lois respects Clark\'s wish for privacy, and stops trying to pursue a story from him.Clark returns to his mother, and happily tells her that he has found where he came from, and who his true parents are. Though Martha fears that her son will now be taken from her, Clark assures her it won\'t happen.Meanwhile, the military has detected a strange ship in geosynchronous orbit around the planet. Others soon report the strange sighting, but are surprised when power is cut off to all parts of the world, and a message is broadcast from General Zod. Zod demands that the people of Earth hand over Kal-El within 24 hours or there will be consequences. A worldwide manhunt is initiated to find this ""Kal-El"". Woodburn is interviewed about the aliens and drops Lois\' name, which soon results in numerous FBI agents being sent to take her into custody. Lois tries to flee from them, but she\'s quickly intercepted and turned over to the US Army.Back in Smallville, Clark goes to a local church, and confesses to the pastor that he is the one the aliens want. Clark admits he is conflicted: he doesn\'t trust that Zod will leave Earth in peace, but he is also wondering if he should trust humanity. His decision is made when the Pastor tells him that sometimes one must take a leap of faith.Clark then appears before the Army in his Kryptonian suit, willing to surrender on condition that he can meet with Lois and that she be freed. Clark is handcuffed (he allows them to, as a gesture of trust and to help them feel more secure), and he and Lois have a short conversation. She asks him about the ""S"" on his chest which he tells her is not an S as Earthlings know it, but a symbol of hope. When she suggests a new moniker, her voice is cut off by feedback from the audio system observers are using behind a 2-way mirror -- but Clark shows he is easily able see through it and identify the people standing behind it. Clark stands up and effortlessly breaks his handcuffs and tells the observers he\'ll allow them to turn him over to Zod and that he\'ll protect the planet from whatever danger Zod presents.In a remote desert, a black craft appears to bring him to Zod\'s ship. The craft is commanded by Faora (Antje Traue), who also demands of General Swanwick (Harry Lennix), that Lois also be taken with them. Though Swanwick points out that the deal was originally for only Kal-El to be handed over, Lois agrees to go with Clark. Before they reach Zod\'s ship, Lois is fitted with a breathing apparatus, as the atmosphere on the ship will be toxic to humans. When Faora is distracted, Clark slips Lois the key he used to restart the Arctic ship.On board the Black Zero, Zod welcomes Clark, who a few moments later collapses to the floor of the ship, seemingly unable to breathe. Though Lois is worried for him, Zod assures her that Clark\'s body is simply adjusting to the Kryptonian atmosphere aboard the ship.Clark passes out, and finds himself in a dreamlike vision of his family\'s farm. Zod explains to Clark that after the destruction of Krypton, the portal to the Phantom Zone where they were trapped was broken open. After modifying the portal\'s Phantom Drive, they were able to transport themselves all across the galaxy in the Black Zero. Visiting the various planets which colonizing ships and teams were sent, their searches for a new planet proved unfruitful, as each of the colonists sent to these various planets were found to have perished. However, Zod and his followers took what they could from the remnants of their civilization, including a terraforming machine called a ""World Engine"".When Clark activated the ship in the Arctic, it sent out a signal which lead Zod to Earth. Zod claims that he intends to turn Earth into a New Krypton, but Clark is unwilling to go along with this plan since it will mean Earth\'s annihilation and the deaths of all humans.Awakening from the vision, Zod tells Clark that with or without him, he will revive their civilization. As well, Clark\'s adjustments to the ship have made him no stronger than the other Kryptonians on it. Consequently, one of Zod\'s men, Jax-Ur (Mackenzie Gray), is able to obtain a blood sample from Clark.Meanwhile, Lois is thrown into a holding cell, where she comes across a panel with a small hole. Lois notes it is the same shape as the key she has. Inserting it allows the information from Jor-El to appear before her. The key causes the ship\'s atmosphere to alter towards more suitable conditions for Clark and Lois, and Jor-El gives Lois valuable information for stopping Zod, along with leading her to an escape pod. As she activates the pod a guard suddenly shoots at her, damaging the pod. The change in the atmosphere returns Clark\'s strength, allowing him to break his bonds, and Jor-El appears before him, pointing out that Lois needs to be saved because of the damage to the pod.Clark saves Lois from the pod, but his attention is soon drawn to his mother, who is set upon by Zod and Faora. Zod goes to the Kent farm, looking for the Codex, which Faora finds is not in the pod Clark arrived on Earth in. When Zod threatens Martha, Clark races to save her, hitting Zod with such force that the two end up thrown into the heart of downtown Smallville. Upon recovering, Zod\'s face-mask malfunctions and his body begins to adapt to the Earthen environment, as he suddenly gains X-Ray vision, and his hearing begins to take in everything at once (just like Clark did when he gained these powers long ago). The effect is debilitating to Zod as his senses overload and he is forced to retreat.Clark claims that his parents helped him hone his skills to control the sensory overload, but his assurance is thrown aside when a ship recovers the stunned Zod, and Faora and a larger Kryptonian (Nam-Ek) attempt to bring Clark down. A battle erupts between Clark and his enemies, causing huge amounts of destruction.Word of the alien presence in Smallville has reached the Army, and Col. Hardy approaches with helicopters and planes. Hardy claims that all three of the aliens (including Clark) are hostile, and all forms of weaponry are thrown at them. Though Faora and Nam-Ek escape, Clark is able to change Hardy\'s mind when he saves the Colonel along with several other soldiers.Clark returns to his mother, but also encounters Lois, who explains to him what Jor-El told her on the ship.Back on his ship, Zod is informed what happened to the Codex. Jor-El had diffused it into Clark\'s cells, making him the source to create new Kryptonian life. When Zod is informed that Clark does not need to be taken alive to retrieve the Codex, he puts his plan into effect.Zod separates the World Engine from the Black Zero. As it touches down in the South Indian Ocean, the Black Zero hovers over Metropolis, it\'s opposite point on the planet. Using the Phantom Drive, Zod activates the World Engine, which creates a link with the Black Zero through the Earth\'s core, beginning the process of terraforming Earth into a planet more like Krypton. Dr. Emil Hamilton determines that the process is creating a stronger gravitational pull and making the planet more dense. The effect causes massive destruction, flattening cars and shaking skyscrapers apart. The force of the machine also causes objects to repeatedly rise and plummet to Earth.As Swanwick contemplates what to do, he receives word that Clark (now being called ""Superman"" by some of the soldiers), has a plan. Using the information that Lois obtained, Clark reasons that if the pod that brought him to Earth is activated by the key he has it will start up the Phantom Drive inside. If the pod collides with Zod\'s ship which also has its drive activated, a black hole will warp the Black Zero and it\'s occupants back into the Phantom Zone.Meanwhile, Zod leaves his ship, and heads for the ship Clark found in the Arctic. On board the ship is a gestation chamber with many unborn Kryptonian fetuses. The projection of Jor-El speaks to Zod, telling him to halt his operation. Zod refuses to listen to the words of a ghost. and will stop at nothing to revive Krypton and it\'s people. Zod\'s key eventually overrides Jor-El\'s, and the ship now responds to Zod, causing Jor-El\'s hologram to disappear.Col Hardy, Dr Hamilton, and Lois board a plane to take the pod to Metropolis, while Superman flies around the world to try and stop the World Engine. However, he is assailed by a Kryptonian defense mechanism within the machine that attempts to fend him off with long tentacles.The situation over Metropolis grows more desperate as none of the planes sent by the Air Force are able to get close to the Black Zero. Zod\'s ship and the World Engine have created a gravitational vacuum that keeps the transport unable to properly launch Clark\'s pod. Realizing there\'s no way he can fight off the tentacles, Clark goes deep under the World Engine to muster his strength and punches his way through it, causing the connection to sever and the machine to explode. With the gravitational disruption gone, Hardy flies the transport closer to Zod\'s ship but it is intercepted by Faora, who attempts to stop them.Meanwhile, Zod has arrived in Metropolis with the ship. As he attempts to destroy the Air Force plane, Clark swoops in and crashes into the ship\'s control panel. Zod yells for Clark to once again let him complete his plan to revive Krypton. ""Krypton had its chance!"" yells Clark, who then uses his heat-vision to tear apart the ship, causing it to crash and the gestation chamber to fracture.Faora\'s attempts fail as well as Hardy steers the plane into the ship. As Lois was on the rear of the plane as it tilted down towards the ship, she loses her balance and falls to Earth. The collision of the two Phantom Drives causes the military aircraft and the Black Zero (along with the people on the vessels) to disappear.Clark manages to save Lois again and puts her safely on the ground. Nearby, the sound of moving metal is heard, and Clark finds Zod, thoroughly enraged. Zod tells Clark that he was engineered to be a General of Krypton and to protect it and its people. With nothing left to revive the planet, Zod seethes that Clark has taken his soul and promises to kill the humans one at a time in retribution for what Clark has done.The two battle across Metropolis, smashing through buildings. During the fight, Zod adapts further to Earth\'s atmosphere, spawning heat-vision and the ability for flight. The battle soon ends with them in a train station, where Zod blasts his heat vision at a nearby family. Clark, with Zod in a choke-hold, tries to keep the beam from engulfing the family. ""If you love these people so much, then you can mourn for them,"" Zod shouts. Clark begs Zod to stop but when Zod claims he will never stop, Clark snaps the General\'s neck, killing him. It is clear that Clark did not want to exact such a terrible judgment, and he agonizes over having not only killed another person, but one of the last of his race. Lois appears and comforts him.Some time later, Swanwick and his adjutant, Major Farris (Christina Wren), find Superman downing an Air Force drone. Superman claims that he knows they had sent it to find his home on Earth but he wants the search to stop. He vows that he will continue to fight for what is right and the security of Earth. The General questions Superman\'s commitment to which Clark replies that he\'s from Kansas and can be trusted. As he flies away, the General\'s adjutant smiles, clearly won over by how handsome and forthright he appears to be.Clark then returns to Smallville, where he and Martha visit Jonathan\'s grave. Clark claims he wishes his father could have seen what he accomplished, but says he did. When she asks what Clark intends to do now, he claims he\'ll get a job where he can be updated on what is going on with the world, where he won\'t be questioned about visiting dangerous places, and where he will be able to ask questions if needed.We then see him in the Daily Planet building, being introduced to Lois Lane as the paper\'s newest reporter. Though he is now sporting a pair of black-rimmed glasses, it is apparent that Lois knows just who this new employee is.']"
13,DC Extended Universe,Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,2975590,"[""No idea why this page still has such bad reviews, even after we have the extended cut. The theatrical cut really doesn't do it justice. Absolutely loved the movie, beautiful cinema!"", ""The theatrical is choppy, poorly edited, hard to follow, with some really good moments mixed in their. The extended is much more fluent and is much easier to follow, it does have a long runtime, which might make it seem a bit dragging on, but if you like long films done right, like Lord of the Rings, you will like this movie as long as you get into the characters and story. Speaking of which, the story starts out perfectly showing Bruce Wayne as a character, and it is very powerful. There are several moments in this movie that are powerful, emotional, and shocking. Characters. Batman is my favorite fictional character of all time, and believe me when I say, Ben Affleck as Batman was perfect, he had the charisma, the anger, and the look of being through some bad stuff Gal Gadot also does perfect as Wonder Woman, but if you want to really see how good she does, go watch the Wonder Woman movie. Henry Call as Superman. I really don't like it when people say Christopher Reeves is better. Don't get me wrong, Reeves does great, but can you imagine him as Superman in this movie? I wouldn't like it. It would be like Adam West playing Batman in The Dark Knight. Henry Cavill does great in this role, I can say everything about him as I said with Ben Affleck. Jesse Eisenberg as Luthor. I thought it was different in a good way. I've heard a criticism for him as being too much like Joker, but is that a bad thing? Joker is my favorite villain, so to see Superman have an enemy that crazy, but still hold the values Luthor needs to be Luthor, I think it is great. The thing I thought this movie was lacking in the first and second acts was humor, at least good humor. If there was more humor, I would've given this movie a ten because it would give a more relaxing feel to the parts that needed it. All in all though, this movie was awesome, it had powerful moments, it was badass, and just plain fun. It had a great story arc and does its job very well."", ""Actually, i don't know what to say but i have already watch this about 10 times. I'm not really into dark and long-slow movies but i really love this one. The characters, The acting, The cinematic and Music is amazing, gorgeous and extremly excellent."", ""I heard bad reviews about this movie but wanted to see the DC movie universe in prep for The Justice a league Snyder cut. Overall I really liked it. Felt that Batman was darker than usual (didn't think he killed people but a does a few times in this movie). Over all it's a great super hero movie.Only complain is I felt like Jesse Eisenberg really tried to be a Heath Ledger Joker in his way of showing Lex Luther. Long hair, erratic movements, playful yet crazy manner, and just the way he spoke his lines really made me feel like he was trying to channel Heath in his portrayal. Other than that I enjoyed the film a lot."", ""This film was amazing. Ben Affleck was easily the best part of this movie, he brought his a-game as Batman. The chemistry between Affleck & Irons was outstanding. Gal Gadot did a great job as Wonder Woman. The fight between Batman & Superman was awesome. The final fight with Doomsday was outstanding in every way possible. However, there is only one problem with this film and that's Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. He was sadly missed cast in this role, but then again it's really the fault of Warner Bros. Studios. Overall, this film deliver on almost every level. I highly recommend that you watch the extended version of this film."", 'Good things,The storyline was great and easy to follow even will look slow burn to some viewers, but there is a reasons behind, to leaving you no question in the end. Production values was high.Bad Things,There are some moments was illogical to the film and also some amateur cast.', ""Both time, re-analyzation and the release of the extended cut have shown that this movie was underrated at the time of its release.Zack Snyder attempts to tell a deep and unique story here. In hindsight, the theatrical release seemed to have been cut down for general audiences and unfortunately, elucidating scenes went with it. This is a story of a disillusioned and hurting Batman who is on the path to villainy before ironically discovering renewed hope and faith through trying to take on the one person his rage is pointed to - Superman. I think the Martha scene is fundamentally misunderstood and so much more poignant than it gets credit for: a mirror is held up to Batman and he finally realizes what Alfred had been trying to tell him - that he has become the type of person he originally swore to bring to justice.While I do agree that the script could have been rewritten slightly to make the interactions and motives between the characters a bit clearer, it is ultimately a very unique, refreshingly dark story grounded in hope and sets the stage for what was to come.Lastly, the marketing for this movie was so spoilery! Had Wonder Woman's arrival in the final fight been kept out of the trailers (for example), the moment upon first viewing would have been EPIC. General message to marketers: learn to tease better."", ""The 2hour31min version wasn't what Zack Snyder wanted to express. We can never understand the Snyderverse without watching the 3hrs version. I promise, you all will love Zack through the film."", ""After Man of Steel's building-destroying fights between Zod and Superman, this film delves into the aftermath of that destruction, the victims and survivors left to put pieces back into place in their lives. With Lex Luther's aid, their wrath is heightened and the city takes the alien to court.A government that needs to control everything wants to reign in Superman's boundless humanity by deciding where he can use his powers for good or bad! But a dastardly plan by Lex turns Superman into a villain. Meanwhile, in Gotham, Batman prepares to punish the caped flying danger to mankind by using a piece of Krypton as a weapon.In his search for a way to subdue his foe, Bruce finds compelling information that there are more metahumans living amongst them, and Diane Prince become his first recruit, or at least he tries.The story is solidly told, with enough exposition to draw deep lines in the separation of good and evil, and enough grey area to make our heroes combat each other- hard! With Lex's creation, called Doomsday, the three heroes must unite to stop the beast, and one will sacrifice themselves with death to save everybody.Snyder's dark take on the Dawn of the Justice League assumes we know both Batman and Superman's backstories and that we've seen the recently released Wonder Woman film. Even Alfred reminds viewers Wayne has been fighting evil for 20 years, and a graffiti covered batsuit tells us the Joker has had his day as well. And Batman's vigilante justice is cruel and final in this movie, even if the jail murders aren't by his hand (Lex may play a part)!This shorthand serves to focus more on the story at hand. The way public opinion is easily swayed. How a hero can be painted evil by a stroke of fate. And how a simple conversation can dispel the deepest of hate towards enemies at war by finding a common bond, as Bruce and Clark do at a critical juncture.Some hints at the upcoming Justice League film scattered throughout, but mostly for Zack's cut, like future Flash's warning.On first viewing when it came out, even though my inner fanboy loved it, I did feel it was a bit over the top and fragmented, but seeing again after watching Zack's Justice League put it in a whole new positive light! A visionary filmaker gave us three masterpiece films unappreciated until all three have been watched! Brilliant!"", 'The ultimate edition is actually really good, the theatrical cut isnt that good', ""In 2016 I was one of the few who actually enjoyed the film , I didn't understand all the hate and bashing and lots of demands that superhero movies should be like marvel , over the years this movie keeps growing on me , I think it's a head of it's time and I can't wait for the Snydercut,#RestoretheSnyderverse"", ""*I will be talking about the Ultimate Edition of the film*This was one of the most anticipated CBM of all time. Ever since the arrival and subsequent success of Marvel's The Avengers people have wondered when will DC launch its own cinematic universe, one of the main reasons being the opportunity to finally see Batman and Superman share the screen together. On 2016, BvS was finally released and its performance wasn't what WB expected. Not only did critical reception left a lot to be desired, but fan reactions where surprisingly split after its cinematic debut. People either loved it and called Zack a genius, or hated it and called him a hack. Me, personally, I found myself with middle of the road feelings, for sure, but more leaning towards the negative side with subsequent viewings.The theatrical cut of the film showcased amazing performances, incredible visuals, and action set pieces that seemed like comic book panels come to life, in a good way. However, when it comes to its narrative structure and more technical aspects like editing, the film was seriously flawed. Multiple gaps in logic, questionable character decisions, random editing that lacked cohesion and focus, and forced dramatic moments that lacked any impact because the attempts at character development ranged from limited to nonexistent, especially when it comes to Superman's character. I thought it was a 5/10 movie at best.As such, I was kind of skeptical about the idea of a 30 minute longer version. I say kind of because I know how Zack works. I remember Watchmen being vastly improved with its director's cut, so in a way I was expecting BvS to perform in a similar manner, but I also feared those 30 minutes wold be just there to amplify action and discredit storytelling issues. Oh boy, I'm so glad I was proven wrong. The ultimate cut of the film was infuriating, but not because it was awful, but because it questions the sanity of WB executives and editors and makes you wonder what were they thinking during the editing process.What I got out of the Ultimate Edition was a thought-provoking character study on both Batman and Superman, placing both characters in a contemporary setting that has them react to a more cynical environment. We meet Batman as a ruthless, worn out hero that has seen the failure of his ideals and renounced his faith on mankind's capacity for good, resorting to a more unforgiving crusade of vigilantism. Superman, on the other hand, is portrayed as an ordinary man perceived as a deity that seeks to do good in the world, but finds himself conflicted once he realizes that every good deed he does leaves behind a trail of sociopolitical ramifications (most of it due to Luthor's antics), falling victim to a prejudicial Metropolis where he has to confront the fears and torments people project onto him.In my opinion, this is a hugely original approach, one that distances itself from the competition and delivers a somber, yet relevant superhero movie that gives its leads real human struggles to deal with. With the new footage, the film finds a way to effectively balance its commitments as a reintroduction to Batman and as a sequel to MoS, following Bruce's journey of redemption as a reaction to Superman's own ordeals. That way, the first two acts play out like a crime thriller that comments on public perceptions and media manipulation. It all culminates in an explosive and emotionally charged climax that feels much more earned after all the restored development.Lex Luthor was also given more time to develop with this new edition. Not only do we spend more time understanding his hatred towards godlike figures, but the added scenes allowed to witness his entire plan come to fruition piece by piece, also helped by a welcome rearrangement of key scenes to improve the flow of the film, particularly in the second act. It does a much better job selling the cold, manipulative, calculating attributes of his comic counterpart, even if the performance itself continues to be hit or miss.That's not to say the film now has no setbacks, like its worldbuilding. The scenes devoted to set up the JL films vaguely tie to the main story and feel like distracting filler. The Knightmare sequence might be visually pleasing and interesting as a concept, but its inclusion in the film felt out of place. This and the e-mail scene would've been better served as post-credit teasers. Some of the third act's logic is also flawed. Doomsday being Lex's contingency plan feels like a gigantic reach. I don't buy Lex, being the smart and clever character he is, being convinced he could control an unstoppable alien killing machine just by birthing him with his blood. Doomsday was only there to justify Wonder Woman's inclusion in the movie, giving the newly formed Trinity a worthy foe to face in the end. The action itself is spectacular, and I did like the way it resolved, what it meant for the characters and the world, but it was the set up to that final showdown what represented the most clumsy bits of storytelling in the movie.If your main complaint about BvS the first time around was its bleak tone and subject matter, this film is still not for you. I understand most were expecting to see the heroes being the most iconic versions of themselves, clashing in an elongated battle and evoking the same feelings The Avengers gave audiences back in 2012, but this film isn't interested in that. Batman v Superman is an action packed drama that's more interested in the human conflicts at play behind the masks, in seeing both characters finding resolution and solace through each other. The fantastical and grounded approach isn't as refined as it was in Man of Steel, but the end result is still as ambitious and, arguably more, entertaining. No matter the version, it will remain a divisive picture, but now at least I have the comfort of saying that, on a technical and narrative standpoint, the film is very competently made."", 'This is by far my favorite movie based on comicbooks.Wonderful cinematography, slow built conflict and great climax. I really don\'t get why people make fun of the ""Martha scene"", people just don\'t seem to understand what Batman felt.Some people say Snyder is pretentious but all I see is a man trying to make something different instead of making cbm that are only fun.', '(Ultimate edition) At the end of the day it\'s a matter of opinion and I wished that the majority of people saw the movie the way I saw it which was not the case. Maybe people came to this movie expecting another superhero movie with a lot of action and epic moments and not expecting a thought provoking one which made them hate it. And if you think about it this theme of testing your characters, putting them under impossible odds and making them react in very ""human"" ways started in Man of Steel.Clark not saving his father and his father sacrificing himself to protect his son from being exposed to the world when he knows that his son is not ready, such an impactful scene.Or the one with Zod forcing Superman to choose between killing him or letting the family die, a situation in which there was no happy outcome which was emphasized in Superman\'s heartbreaking scream after he snapped Zod\'s neck.Something you don\'t usually see in superhero movies and still people criticized that movie for both of those scenes. Zack Snyder is not the best director there is but he makes movies that you come back to after years later and see them in a new and different light and he actually said it himself, his movies are directed to the adult audience not the kids.Snyder is aware of how different his interpretation of Batman is to all other interpretations you\'ve been exposed to all your life. It\'s a story of a broken man who lost too much and changed in the process with his anger directed towards all these people that ""he"" considers as criminals including Superman. Which in my interpretation the mentioning of his mother\'s name ""Martha"" brought him back to the reality, to the beginning, the trigger of what made him become this knight in the dark to what he was when he first started and what he has become.I love Batman v Superman.', ""Just please watch the ultimate edition of this movie. It's such a masterpiece to the genre."", ""While there are some moments that don't make a whole lot of sense with characters and plot points, I really liked Ben Affleck as Batman and Jeremy Irons as Alfred! While the portrayal of Lex Luther was disappointing at some moments it worked! And who can forget the beautiful Gal Gadot?? I'd say it gets a bit too much hate."", 'I know I know. I saw it in theaters too, and felt like it could\'ve been so much better. While the Batman element was good, the narrative felt fractured, and the third act was just one long stunt scene. Superman was relegated to a supporting character, and other characters didn\'t get a chance to shine. And then I chanced on the ultimate cut. Calling it 30 mins of ""extra"" footage is unfair to Zack Snyder because it\'s exactly these 30 mins that makes the movie a worthy one. What I can say about the theatrical cut is this - It had the blockbuster elements - music, visuals, stunts, CGI. But, it lacked the human elements. The first 20 mins of the movie had it, but not after that. The extended cut in comparison has a flow to the narrative. There are no disjointed scenes, everything flows smoothly, and there\'s connective tissue. Superman gets to spend some time with his father, and mother. Clark Kent does some investigative journalism. Superman helps the people after the blast. Lois Lane doesn\'t jump to conclusions, she gets to the bottom of the crime. Lex Luthor apparently had a coherent plan - everything is explained pretty well. Wonder Woman was already good, so there\'s no change there :) Also, the ""Martha"" scene seems better executed, because it is a few seconds longer, and there\'s time to breathe it in. So, here\'s my take on this movie - The theatrical cut was junk. Get the Bluray for ultimate edition, and you shall not be disappointed. I\'ve seen it so many more times now, and it\'s the definitive cut. It is the movie we deserve. It\'s a unique take on Batman, and Superman. It\'s a gritty take on the superhero movie genre, and definitely the best DCEU movie, and the best DC movie since The Dark Knight.P.S. Yes it\'s dark. We\'re adults, and we should appreciate mature film making without intentionally silly moments. It attempts to be philosophical, and something deep instead of just trying to make you chuckle.', 'Okay! Lot of people didn\'t get this movie. Let me break it for you guys.Batman hates superman for the casualties he caused in Man of Steel. He is convinced that superman acted irresponsibly in Metropolis and Africa and adamant on making Superman pay for that. Batman from BvS is different from the Mr. Perfect Batman from Nolan movies. From the first half of the BvS, one can interpret that Batman is past some tripping point. He had enough of following principles and losing loved ones(Robin, for example). He had been pushed past his breaking point, his interpretation of right and wrong got blurry. He is angry and hunt the bad guys, acting as judge jury and executioner.Superman didn\'t like bruce acting as a bad vigilante or as they put in the movie - judge jury and executioner. Superman hates Batman but not to the point of killing him.The whole movie is about Batman realising how wrong he was, how low he fell and how he acted like a psychopath since for some past unknown years(Since some tripping point). PTSD(Save Martha!) make him realise this! I get it, It\'s very dramatic.Also there are quite a few ""I can relate to that"" moments in this movie which is very hard to say for superhero movies these days. Personally, I can relate to a lot to how superman felt insecure about his powers and how he felt bad that people are judging him. I can relate to Batman being stubborn, dead set on his stupidness. It\'s interesting to see Superheroes with some defect in their characters like we all do. Nobody is perfect.I can understand people saying it\'s not a great movie but it is also not a worst movie. It\'s a decent take on breaking stereotypes of superhero movies, with great visuals, great music and good story.', 'The extended cut is definitely the way to watch this movie. That being said, I\'m going to explain to everyone the highly criticized ""Martha"" scene.The reason Batman ultimately stopped short of killing Superman had nothing to do with both mothers having the same name. While Clark saying that name caught him off guard, once Lois explained it\'s his mother\'s name, Bruce realized in that moment that Superman was as human as anyone else. Remember, right before""Martha"", Batman said he probably isn\'t even human. But by having a mother, Bruce realized Clark was as human as anyone else, since all humans have a mother. That\'s what that scene is all about.', ""I was greatly impressed by this movie, much more than I thought I would be. I actually thought Ben Affleck was great in the role of Batman, contrary to pre-release public angst. Henry Cavill, of course, is awesome as Superman. Jeremy Irons is perfect as Alfred, the scolding father-figure-conscience that Bruce Wayne needs, although every time he opens his mouth I hear Scar (Jeremy Irons' iconic Lion King role). Laurence Fishburne was a welcome surprise as Perry White This movie touches on a lot of subject matter, and takes its time nicely to develop back-story, side-plots, and flesh out Batman's violent and evil side. He's really a sadistic vigilante. But that's why we love him. Ben Affleck plays it gritty and angry, and it works. The casting of Eisenberg as Luthor was a little iffy and more annoying than evil, but he makes up for it in craziness. I don't want to give away anything else. This movie is definitely worth a watch. Really, really good!"", ""Like it or not I can safely say BvS got so much hate that is very unfair, even though the theatrical cut was ok but after watching the UE it's time to get justice for zack snyder and give BvS higher score and rating."", 'Just watch the ultimate edition, you will get all the answers', ""Batman v Superman was the first hollywood and 3D movie I watched in the theatre. I have to say, I was highly disappointed. The movie didn't make any sense. And that martha scene was so bad to watch.I thought what's the point of this movie? How can they mess up so badly?I spent 4 years bad mouthing this film everywhere. I used to hate Henry Carvill's version of superman. I used to hate this movie, that is, until I watched the ultimate edition!Now I have to say that it's an amazing film! While it still has some minor flaws, it's an absolute treat to watch.You have to keep in mind that this Bruce is not the batman you know anymore. After losing everyone including Robin, he has abandoned his one rule. He has become more depressed and violent. This movie shows that Batman shouldn't kill by showing us how he is ready to let the thugs die.This Clark is not the superman yet. He's new to the process. He has just started wearing the suit and the whole world fears him and looks at him like a false God. In time, he'll learn to be the Superman we know and love.This movie is one of the most underrated and entertaining piece of art I have ever seen."", ""Yes i totally agree. Thetrical cut wasn't that good. Well, you can blame Warner Bros for that. Ultimate Edition on the other hand is one of the best comic book films of all time in my opinion. It covers the plot holes the theatrical cut had, answers a lot of questions, gives more depth to the characters and makes tou truly understand why Batman and Superman hated each other. It's one of those movies that the more times you watch it, the more you appreciate it. All in all, i really enjoyed it (coming from a huge DC fan)!!P. S: After watching the Snyder Cut this movie is even better."", 'My favourite DCEU movie. Ben Affleck nailed it. Jeremy irons was a perfect choice for Alfredo. Jesse Eisenberg was also perfect for lex Luthor.', 'Eighteen months after the destructive battle in Metropolis (Man of Steel), Superman has become a controversial figure. Billionaire Bruce Wayne, who has covertly operated in Gotham City as vigilante Batman for nearly two decades, blames Superman for the mass casualties that resulted from his fight with General Zod. Among the casualties were many people working in Wayne Enterprises headquarters when the tower collapsed. Superman, in his public identity as Daily Planet journalist Clark Kent, sees Batman as dangerous and seeks to expose him.LexCorp\'s mogul Lex Luthor also sees Superman as a threat and convinces Senator June Finch to help him recover kryptonite from Zod\'s failed terraforming attempt in the Indian Ocean. Finch later stonewalls Luthor\'s efforts to use Zod\'s DNA and the Kryptonian scout ship recovered from the battle to create a biological weapon.Wayne successfully infiltrates a fundraiser promoted by Luthor to retrieve data from LexCorp\'s mainframe, but his flash drive is stolen by mysterious antiques dealer Diana Prince, who learns that Luthor has files on several ""metahumans""; beings with superhuman abilities; herself, as well as a man with superhuman speed (Flash), a cybernetic body (Cyborg), and a man that lives underwater (Aquaman). Wayne later receives the drive back from her after she copies it. While decrypting the drive, he has a vision of a dystopian future where he sees a gigantic omega symbol etched into a desert landscape. Armed with a pistol, he leads a force of rebels against Superman. Batman is betrayed by his own men, captured and held prisoner by Superman\'s army. Superman approaches him, rips off his cowl and tells him he took everything from him. Superman then rips out Batman\'s heart.Wayne is snapped out of the vision by a mysterious time traveler, who warns him that Lois Lane has a crucial role to an impending threat, and that he must find the others. Before he vanishes, the time traveler yells that he\'s ""too soon"" with his message. He later learns not only of Luthor\'s experiments with kryptonite, but also his ongoing investigation about metahumans including Prince herself, who is an immortal warrior. Batman attempts to retrieve Luthor\'s kryptonite in the Batmobile, but is intercepted by Superman, who orders him to cease his activities. Later, Finch summons Superman to a Congressional hearing at the U.S. Capitol to debate the validity of his actions. Using a man who was paralyzed by Superman\'s battle with Zod in Metropolis, Luthor masterminds a bombing that kills dozens of people by hiding the bomb in the man\'s wheelchair. Everyone in the chamber is killed, including Finch. Despite being seen carrying the injured out of the blast-zone, the public blames the bombing on Superman, who goes into self-imposed exile.Batman retrieves the kryptonite and prepares to launch a strike against Superman; building a powerful exoskeleton and kryptonite-powered arsenal. With Batman now having the kryptonite, Luthor activates the Genesis Chamber aboard the scout ship and splices his own DNA and Zod\'s. Luthor endangers Lois to lure Superman to LexCorp Tower, where he reveals that he has been aware of Superman\'s secrets for some time. Luthor blackmails Superman into confronting Batman by holding his adoptive mother, Martha Kent, hostage at an undisclosed location, anticipating that Batman would kill Superman with his kryptonite.Superman tries to reason with Batman, revealing that he knows his secrets, but leads to a fight in which Batman nearly kills Superman with a spear he\'d fashioned from the kryptonite. Superman pleads for Batman to ""save Martha"", which was also the latter\'s late mother\'s name, prompting him to come to his senses and realize Superman is not a threat. Upon learning of Luthor\'s plan, Batman leaves to rescue Martha while Superman confronts Luthor, who unleashes a monstrous artificially-bred creature (Doomsday) made with Kryptonian technology on the crashed ship.Superman and Batman join forces to fight him and are aided by an arriving Prince in her Amazonian attire, but are outmatched due to the creature\'s ability to absorb and redirect energy, becoming indestructible in the process. Realizing that their shared Kryptonian DNA results in shared vulnerabilities, Superman retrieves the kryptonite spear and impales the creature with it, while the creature stabs Superman with his bony spike, seemingly killing him.Luthor is arrested after Lane exposes his numerous crimes; when he is visited by Batman in prison, he gloats that Superman\'s death has made the world vulnerable to powerful threats, of which he was taught about while manipulating the Kryptonian ship\'s technology. Batman threatens Luthor, and promises that he will always be watching him. A memorial is held for Superman in Metropolis, and as Clark is also declared dead. Wayne, Lane, Martha, and Prince attend a private funeral for Clark in Smallville. Martha passes an envelope to Lane, which contains an engagement ring from Clark. After the funeral, Wayne reveals to Prince that he plans to form a team (the Justice League) from Luthor\'s file subjects to protect the world in Superman\'s absence. Later, a faint heartbeat begins echoing from Clark\'s grave and the dirt around it begins to levitate.']"
14,DC Extended Universe,Suicide Squad 2016,1386697,"[""'Suicide Squad' didn't sound so bad in hindsight. The concept was actually pretty interesting and there is a good deal of talent in the cast. Unfortunately what should have been a winner turned out to be a sore loser, even more of a wasted opportunity than 'Batman vs. Superman'.The costume and production design is both brooding and vibrantly colourful. There are two performances that are good. One is the enormously fun but also just as deliciously deranged Margot Robbie, her Harley Quinn being the film's most interesting character. The other is a menacing Viola Davis, proving that even a stony face makes one feel uneasy. El Diablo is also entertaining, and one of the few characters to be used right and feel necessary.However, for me Will Smith didn't work. You don't see him as Deadshot, you see him playing himself in wooden fashion here and plays Deadshot too jovially, something that Deadshot isn't really, that he also had two introductions gives an indication that the writers didn't know how to characterise the character. Enchantress is a pretty lame villain played with all cheese no menace by Cara Delevigne, while Jared Leto's Joker proves pointless and misplaced to the story (other than giving Harley Quinn backstory which wasn't fleshed out enough). Likewise with the Batman of Ben Affleck, while Killer Croc has nothing to do.One of 'Suicide Squad's' biggest failings is its treatment of the characters. Only Harley Quinn is fully fleshed out, while many characters are either given short shrift or either there was no use to them being there, for example what was the point of having Slipknot and then dispatch the character so quickly and cheaply. This is the consequences of having too many characters and a very muddled story that not only feels rushed but also incredibly confused. The script is equally a mess, with forced and very lazily-written jokes.Visually, other than the costume and set design, 'Suicide Squad' doesn't have the redeeming value of looking good. Editing is choppy and the special effects range from average at best but mostly amateurish. The action scenes are very routine and less than thrilling, chemistry is extremely limited and suspense is next to zero. Plus the music is too constant and far too loud that it becomes a nauseating assault on the ears.In conclusion, could have been a fun film but flounders badly due to lame execution that wastes its characters and much of the cast (with only Davis and particularly Robbie standing out). 3/10 Bethany Cox"", ""SUICIDE SQUAD is a choppy, sprawling effort from the DC Universe from hit-or-miss director David Ayer. The idea is to have all the major villains teaming up to go on their own DIRTY DOZEN-style story in return for a reduction in their jail sentences. Sadly, the end result is choppy and imperfect, mildly entertaining here and there but failing overall. Certain elements, like Jared Leto's Joker, feel extraneous to the main story and have no real reason to be included. And the addition of an embarrassingly awful Cara Delevingne as the villain of the piece - she's no actress and never has been - is the film's nadir. However, it's not all bad. Will Smith is likeable and assured as the lead, given solid support by Joel Kinnaman and Jai Courtney. The film has an absolute ton of action to see it through, so although it's frequently silly, it's never boring, at least. It's a shame it all ends in a generic CGI way, as have pretty much all superhero flicks of the last ten years, but it's not unwatchable."", ""Suicide Squad (2016)* (out of 4) Deadshot (Will Smith), Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), Killer Croc and El Diablo are among some of the most ruthless criminals out there but thankfully they're all locked up. That is until Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) decides to get them out and form a gang to protect the world from certain dangers.You know, a couple weeks before I watched this Martin Scorsese came out and said that cinema was dead. Even though he's my favorite director I didn't agree with him but after watching SUICIDE SQUAD I started to see where he was coming from. What's so amazing about this movie is that it's not only much worse than the unfairly bashed BATMAN VS SUPERMAN but it's also one of the worst action films that you're going to see and especially one with such a large budget.I will freely admit that I'm not a comic book reader so I have no idea how close the film came to capturing the characters or anything like that. For my money this here was one of the worst summer blockbusters ever made for a number of reasons but the biggest is the fact that I found every second of it to be downright lifeless. There was no energy to be found anywhere. Instead of this we're just given a bunch of loud and obnoxious action scenes. Another problem is that the film just wasn't any fun. I don't mind a superhero movie being dark but there's gotta be some sort of entertainment value and there's not much here.There was a lot of rumbles about the casting in the film. There's no question that Robbie was a good choice for the role of Harley Quinn but it also seems that the producers knew they had a limp movie. Just like the great sexploitation filmmakers of the 70s, they seemed to realize that they didn't have much of a movie so they amped up the sexual flavor. There was a bunch of heat about Jared Leto's role of The Joker being cut short and if that's true it's easy to see why. I thought the character was downright horrible here and it was just a really awful stain on the film. The rest of the Suicide Squad members weren't any more entertaining and that includes the lifeless Smith.What was so bad (or funny) about the story is that it's basically a reworked version of John Carpenter's classic ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK. The plot as well as how they control the characters that are placed inside the location to do a job. SUICIDE SQUAD is said to have had re-shoots done in order to try and make it better. I think the only thing that would have worked was to burn the negative and film an entirely new movie."", ""Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) recruits various criminals from a black site in Louisiana to battle the new unprecedented dangers. June Moone (Cara Delevingne) is an archaeologist who got possessed by a witch named Enchantress. Special forces Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman) fell in love with her and leads the group. Floyd Lawton (Will Smith) is assassin Deadshot who can't miss. The most important thing in his life is his daughter. George Harkness (Jai Courtney) is Captain Boomerang. Chato Santana is El Diablo but he has turned pacifist. Waylon Jones is Killer Croc. Tatsu Yamashiro is Katana with a soul stealing sword. There is Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), the psycho love of The Joker (Jared Leto). A powerful danger is unleashed in Midway City and the group is called.This was critically panned by the majority. I expected more of a mess. The story is simple and easy to follow. No doubt, there are some jarring edits with some disjointed flow. It's a little bothersome but it doesn't make it incomprehensible. The movie just keeps hitting speed bumps with annoying little problems. What's with Enchantress' movements? Her whole character is problematic. Why would Harley Quinn go back? Why would Waller kill everyone? There are varying problems in the writing. On the positive side, these are interesting characters well played by skilled actors. Will Smith, Margot Robbie, and Jared Leto are standouts. Joker and Harley Quinn have a great story together. If anything, this shows potential for these characters into the future."", ""I remember as a child when Universal decided to take all the monsters (Frankenstein's monster, the Wolf Man, the hunchback, Dracula, etc.) and have them all in the same movie. These were the worst of the series.. This is another case of too many characters, no plot, no substance. I guess it won an award for costuming but the characters demand that they be costumed to be the characters. Don't bother."", '""Suicide Squad"" is an American movie from 2016 and actually among the biggest commercial successes from last year if we look at box office revenues. Still I have a feeling they may have expected more and we will see if it was still enough for them to make a sequel at some point. Writer and director is David Ayer and he had some big Hollywood names in his cast here like Will Smith, recent Oscar winners Viola Davis and Jared Leto as well as up-and-comers Margot Robbie and Cara Delevingne. And as the film also falls into the superhero genre, even if super villain genre would be more accurate, it was somehow guaranteed a crowd magnet. Critics reception, however wasn\'t great at all, and the film is mentioned by many as the biggest disappointment of the year, which I do not agree with at all as it really isn\'t that bad. This did not keep the Oscars though from giving it an Academy Award and yes makeup and hair-styling are really among the not too many strengths this film had. The characters\' looks, also during the long introduction, early on are definitely something that elevated the mediocre and frequently very generic material. I am referring here to the father-daughter story, the fire villain\'s fear from causing destruction and other story lines too. They never become as emotional, let alone memorable, as they were intended too.And then there is Harley Quinn, maybe the film\'s most memorable character, but I also think that had more to do with the physical side than with the way Robbie played her. Admittedly, I did not find Robbie as bad or forgettable as she was in other roles, so maybe she was just a good casting decision. Still the way they used her character as a trigger for comedy looking at how insane she was did get repetitive quickly. Same goes for the ways in which Viola Davis was treated by all the villains like such a respectable, bad-ass character with so much authority that it was fairly cringeworthy. Besides, the ways in which the film tried to go for comedy like a villain equivalent to Guardians of the Galaxy was rarely successful at all and felt pretty forced most of the time. It\'s probably just not Ayer\'s genre. So going for a full gritty and dark approach would have been the better solution.Finally, a couple words on Leto\'s Joker. I think he is a talented actor and the character is really epic, but somehow it wasn\'t working out at all. I would not blame the makeup, but something didn\'t feel right there. I am saying this as somebody who is not a Ledger fanboy at all, but actually preferred Nicholson\'s take on the character I think. Let\'s hope Leto is back to his best with future projects (like the Blade Runner sequel) as he is too talented to appear in so few films only like he did for a while when he focused on his singing career. Here we have a really long film at easily over 2 hours, which is not too surprising for the genre, but sadly the quality is not on par with the quantity. It is maybe worth seeing for the occasional entertainment factor and as a pointless fun film overall, but depth and creativity are almost non-existent here. You won\'t find anything in here you haven\'t seen before already and frequently better. That\'s why I give the final outcome a thumbs-down and even if it was a close call, I don\'t recommend the watch.', ""I think I saw this film many years ago. It was called The Dirty Dozen and it had a more coherent plot.Suicide Squad is a combination of bad asses from the world of DC comics as intelligence operative Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) assembles a team of meta-humans, that is humans with some superpowers to defend the world the next time the world encounters a villain with the powers that Superman has. I think Waller describes a situation of who would save the world if someone took the roof of the White House and entered the Oval Office, which is exactly what happened in Superman II.The Suicide Squad consists of Deadshot (Will Smith), Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney), Diablo (Jay Hernandez), Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje). To keep them in check is Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman) who is also seeking to rescue his lover Dr June Moone who is possessed by the evil Enchantress (Cara Delevingne.)Everyone has a back story but the film concentrates mainly on Deadshot and Harley Quinn with the Joker (Jared Leto) popping in as a strategic and unfunny guest villain.The story is a bit of a mess with a weak plot and most of the action located on a sound stage shot at night time. You know this group of bad people will defy authority, plan to escape and eventually bond to take on the villains which seems to be some kind of CGI monsters who conveniently get shot, slashed, banged or knocked out by a baseball bat. Some of the anti heroes do not have super powers at all but people like Diablo or Killer Croc do.Although I admire Leto's take on the Joker, he was messily written and I expected silly humour from him which was non existent here.Still Warner Brother's have learned from Marvel and included an eclectic soundtrack, they have at least made the film entertaining. I just think their world of heroes lacked the cohesiveness that Marvel have achieved and this is mainly down to a sub par screenplay."", 'After the death of Superman, the leader of a secret agency Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) convinces the government to recruit super-villains imprisoned in Belle Eve to protect the world.

Two hours of wall to wall nonsense, there was virtually no plot of any kind, or what there was went over my head.

At this very time I'd have to say I thought it was very poor. 3/10"", ""You'd expect people to say that about DC trying to place themselves as a worthy opponent and rival to Marvel. And while in the Comic Book world it is a competition, it's hard to see that in the Movie universe happening anytime soon. Which is a shame when you think that this also could've been so much better.While I've only seen the cinematic version (not the extended one), this unfortunately wasn't as much fun as I'd hoped for. Still it wasn't all bad. What was almost all bad strangely enough, was Harley Quinn. The trailer promised a lot, but apart from kind of like every funny line being in there, they didn't work in the movie itself. They felt all wrong and I don't fault the Margot Robbie for that. Also the inciting incident is so crazy, I wonder if anyone actually can just swallow that pill without going blank and kind of crazy.There are a lot of good actors involved in this and they alone warrant a viewing of this. Also the action, no matter how far fetched and stretched it may seem, kind of works too. Just do not compare it under no circumstances with Guardians ..."", 'I held off watching this flick for the primary reason that I thought it would be more like ""Deadpool"", with liberal use of the \'F\' word and an unhealthy balance of sex and violence for a comic book based movie. So the good surprise here is that the DC folks didn\'t further lower the bar on entertainment value by going for the cheap and nasty.On the flip side though, the story falls victim to that ever present need to fill the screen with the most over the top action sequences the film makers can to rid the world of the latest all powerful villain menace bent on dominating the planet. It gets so repetitious after a while that it almost legislates against seeing the next picture to come out because you know it will just be more of the same.Taken individually, I did get a kick out of the principal players. Margot Robbie\'s take on Harley Quinn and Jared Leto\'s portrayal of The Joker were about the best one could expect of actors who have mentally challenged characters to portray. It\'s interesting to contrast Leto\'s Joker with Heath Ledger\'s in ""The Dark Knight"". Ledger\'s was more of an extremist, almost a terrorist one might say, whereas Leto came at the character as someone who was deranged. I didn\'t think anyone could top Ledger\'s performance as The Joker at the time, but Leto\'s performance now gives me pause.As for the rest, the remaining meta-humans to join the Squad were OK, but there wasn\'t much time to focus on their characters with Deadshot (Will Smith) and Harley Quinn doing most of the heavy lifting. As for squad leader Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman), he seemed almost superfluous except for his connection to June Moone/The Enchantress (Cara Deleningne). The ease with which Harley managed to fake out Enchantress and steal her heart seemed like a total let down with global domination at stake. Same thing with Incubus, a potential bad guy with the power of a Superman, yet he got dusted by a fiery opponent and blown up. Doesn\'t say much for world threatening super-villains.Well it\'s a been there, done that viewing for me and I\'d like to be a bit more positive about the picture but it was just something to get out of the way. The after credit scene didn\'t much inspire to see the follow up sequel, if in fact there is one. Judging by the amount of negative reviews on this board, there might be reason to reconsider.', 'The trailer for this DC Comics based movie looked great, many of the most well known supervillains brought together, I was certainly hoping it would be an improvement on the awful Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, directed by David Ayer (The Fast and the Furious, Training Day, End of Watch, Fury). Basically in the aftermath of Superman\'s death, at Belle Reve Penitentiary, intelligence operative Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) has assembled a team of dangerous criminals: former psychiatrist Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), elite hit man Floyd Lawton aka Deadshot (Will Smith), pyrokinetic ex-gangster El Diablo (Jay Hernandez), opportunistic thief Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney), monstrous cannibal Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) and specialised assassin Slipknot (Adam Beach). Under the command of Colonel Rick Flag (RoboCop\'s Joel Kinnaman), the team are to be used as disposable assets in high-risk missions for the U.S. government, the criminals are told their individual sentences will be reduced, and they have small bombs implanted in their necks, which will detonate if any try to rebel or escape. Former archaeologist and Flag\'s girlfriend June Moone (Cara Delevingne) was intended recruit, touching a cursed idol she is possessed by a witch-goddess known as ""Enchantress"", she has turned on everyone and wants to eradicate mankind, she has surrounded Midway City with monsters, begun creating a weapon, and summoned her brother Incubus (Alain Chanoine) to assist her. The squad is deployed and briefed, they are under the impression they are tackling a terrorist attack, but they are convinced it is a suicide mission, they are joined by mystic sword wielding Katana (Karen Fukuhara), she is acting as Flag\'s bodyguard. Meanwhile, Harley\'s lover, psychopathic supervillain the Joker (Razzie nominated Jared Leto) finds out about her predicament, he tortures Waller\'s man Griggs (Ike Barinholtz) and is lead to the facility where the nano bombs are made, the Joker blackmails a scientist into disabling Harley\'s bomb. The team\'s helicopter is shot down as they approach, forcing them to continue on foot, Slipknot is convinced by Boomerang the bombs are a ruse to keep them under control, he is killed attempting to escape, while the Enchantress\' minions attack the team. The team manage to escape and reach a safe room, where they learn Waller herself is their mark, she is trying to cover her involvement, the squad escort Waller to the roof for extraction, but the Joker and his men have hijacked the helicopter, they open fire while Harley climbs aboard, however they are shot down, Harley jumps out while the Joker seemingly perishes in the explosion, Harley rejoins the team. Waller is kidnapped by the Enchantress\' minions, while Deadshot confronts Flag about secret files found with the truth about the Enchantress, the squad members and Katana leave Flag after he confesses the truth, with Waller compromised, Flag chooses to continue and relieves the squad of the mission. The team realise they have the opportunity to prove themselves, they rejoin Flag, locate the Enchantress and Waller at a partially flooded subway station, the squad fight the Enchantress and her forces, while Killer Croc and Navy Seals, led by Lieutenant GQ Edwards (Scott Eastwood, Clint\'s son), plant a bomb underneath Incubus. El Diablo embraces his abilities and manages to hold Incubus down, the bomb goes off underneath, El Diablo, Incubus and Edwards are killed, the squad members are defeated battling Enchantress, in exchange for their allegiance she offers to fulfil their deepest desires, Harley appears to accept in order to get close to Enchantress and cut her heart out. The weapon is destroyed by explosives thrown by Killer Croc and shot by Deadshot, Enchantress\' heart is crushed by Flag, Enchantress is killed and June is freed, Waller emerges alive and the squad members are returned to Belle Rave with ten years off their sentences. In the end, all but Captain Boomerang have special privileges, the Joker breaks out Harley, and Waller meets Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck), who agrees to protect her backlash, in exchange for access to government files on the expanding metahuman community. Also starring Common as Monster T, Jim Parrack as Frost, David Harbour as Dexter Tolliver and We Need to Talk About Kevin\'s Ezra Miller as The Flash. Smith is great as the expert assassin, Robbie is terrifically mad and flirtatious as Harley Quinn (the big screen live action debut for the character, introduced in Batman: The Animated Series), Leto is a questionable alternative Joker with gold teeth and tattoos, Delevingne is rather average as the witch wanting to take over the world, Davis is menacing, and some of the other supporting stars do well. It has a brilliant soundtrack, including Grace feat. G-Eazy - ""You Don\'t Own Me"", Eminem"" Without Me"", The Animals - ""The House of the Rising Sun"", Creedence Clearwater Revival - ""Fortunate Son"", Black Sabbath - ""Paranoid"", The White Stripes - ""Seven Nation Army"", Norman Greenbaum - ""Spirit in the Sky"", K7 - ""Come Baby Come"" and Queen - ""Bohemian Rhapsody"". It seems that the trend of superhero movies are dominated by the more successful Marvel Universe, but this is certainly better than the last offering from DC. The special effects and makeup are fantastic, there are small flaws, the story is only just passable, the editing style can be a bit much, and the over-the-top action and stunts border on ridicuous, but there is some fun to be had, it\'s not a bad anti-superhero fantasy action film. It won the Oscar for Best Makeup and Hairstyling, and it was nominated the Razzie for Worst Screenplay for David Ayer. Okay!', ""After the death of Superman those in power worry how the Earth would cope if the next super-powered being to turn up used their power to defeat rather than help humanity. To that end Task Force X, AKA the Suicide Squad, is established; a group made up of the most dangerous super-villains who have been captured! Of course they cannot be trusted but with an explosive charge placed in their necks they might just behave. When a threat emerges they are led by Col Rick Flag to confront that threat... which just happens to involve the woman Flag loves.Even before I watched this I'd heard it was pretty terrible... I wouldn't say it was that bad but it could have been so much better. Too much of the film's opening was dedicated to showing us how the various villains got caught; something that wasn't really necessary. Then when the action started much of it was too dark... as in it was hard to see what was happening. Tonally it wasn't dark enough; these are meant to be super-villains but the film didn't seem that violent... it would have been better had it been as violent as 'Kick-Ass' or even 'Dredd' but I guess the makers wanted a teen-friendly rating. The cast are solid enough; Margot Robbie stole just about every scene she was in with her performance as the crazy and dangerous, but still likeable Harley Quinn; Jared Leto impressed as The Joker, although his character wasn't in the Squad and was sorely underused. Overall I'd say this was entertaining enough but if you expect something great you are likely to be disappointed."", 'While I am not overly much fan of the superhero genre as such, then ""Suicide Squad"" was sort of a most welcomed addition to the genre. Why? Well because you have a group of less than savory characters gifted with super powers, so you don\'t have to witness a group of goody two shoes running around trying to save the Earth while doing what is morally and ethically sound and politically correct. It was refreshing to have a bunch of baddies running around and dealing out punishment while trying to save the Earth. Yeah, it still has that oh-so-glorious-saving-the-Earth element to it.Now, ""Suicide Squad"" falls right into the same alley as Christopher Nolan\'s darkly set Batman movies, and it fits right in there. Oh, and Batman is actually also in this movie, so go figure...While the movie is titled ""Suicide Squad"", it might as well have been named ""Harley Quinn"" or something like that, because this movie was essentially about her because she was so often the focal point that most of the other bad guys (read protagonists here) sort of fell a bit in the background and were looming in her shadow.The movie does have some interesting characters. First and foremost, and which is not a shocker nor a surprise to anyone, is Harley Quinn (played formidably by Margot Robbie). Now I am not familiar with her character from the comic books, so I have no base of comparison, but what I saw in this movie was impressive.Then there is Killer Croc (played by Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), whom actually was a surprise of a character, because I had initially written the character off as being just another brawny goon. But it turned out that the character was quite interesting.Right up alongside Harley Quinn in terms of being interesting was Enchantress (played by Cara Delevingne). That character design, when she was in her shadow-form, was amazing. And it was actually one of the most memorable and impressive of characters that I have seen in a superhero movie, and would definitely like to see a spin off movie with this character - and also a movie with Harley Quinn, of course.Deadshot was also an interesting enough character, but I think that having cast Will Smith for the role was not the right actor. Sure he is talented, but he just didn\'t sit well with me in this particular role.Katana was also a character that had potential, but the character wasn\'t really fully utilized or put to proper use throughout the course of the movie. And it is also a character that would be suitable for a solo movie. The actress Karen Fukuhara was a great choice for the character, and she more than lived up to the part. Just a shame that the character was sort of cut short on screen time. However, the name Katana is just stupid. Why name yourself after your choice of weapon? Sure, I get the part with the katana stealing the souls of the ones killed by its blade, but come on...And while we are on the characters, then I must say that I was struggling hard with taking Jared Leto serious in the role as The Joker. It was mostly because of the teeth grills. It just made the character look like a pathetic white wannabe gangsta. And it was totally unjustifiable for the iconic character that The Joker is. Certain aspects to Jared Leto\'s performance was good enough, but I just couldn\'t look past his pathetic appearance, and it took away so much from the character and its importance to the movie.""Suicide Squad"" is an entertaining action movie for what it turned out to be. It is not a movie that challenges the intellect of the audience in the least. This is pure and simple a lean-back-and-enjoy-the-action types of movies. And that is adequate enough, and director David Ayer did a good enough job with this movie.The effects in the movie were good and they more than lives up to the things they were supposed to bring out on the screen. And for a movie such as this, then special effects and CGIs that are realistic and believable is important.""Suicide Squad"" is definitely a movie that was needed to the superhero genre, just like ""Watchmen"" was back in 2009. Just keep in mind that this is a predictable movie, driven by one-liners, special effects and quirky characters.', ""As much as I prefer the DC universe over Marvel, those behind the movies seem unable to replicate the ingenuity and entertainment level of superhero competitors Marvel. Pretty much every movie DC have produced since the turn of the millennium has been disappointing (and yes, I do include Nolan's vastly over-rated Batman trilogy in that statement).Suicide Squad is no exception\x85 a chaotic mess of a movie that lingers in the mind for about as long as it takes the Flash to nip to the shops and back. Writer/director David Ayer clearly hopes that the novelty of a team of super-villains will be enough to carry the movie, but he's wrong: Suicide Squad is desperately in need of a creative driving force who is more concerned with telling a decent story than showcasing his cool characters and blowing his budget on an arsenal of trendy graphics and expensive CGI special effects.As far as the cast are concerned, Will Smith is adequate as Deadshot, the world's greatest hit-man, Margot Robbie's butt is great as Harley Quinn's butt, and Karen Fukuhara as Katana ably fulfils the token Asian hottie role for the overseas market, but everyone else is bland and instantly forgettable, including Jared Leto as the worst incarnation of the Joker to ever grace the silver screen. And whoever thought that the world's ugliest supermodel, Cara Delevingne, would make for an imposing villainess needs their head checked: she's dreadful."", ""I watched this movie at home on DVD from my public library, when my wife was out of town. It is not her kind of movie anyway.The premise is interesting, some supernatural villains have surfaced and the fate of the world is in the balance. A high-ranking government official hatches a secret, unofficial plan ... a group of highly dangerous, incarcerated meta humans will be sprung to use their special powers to defeat the villains. What is their incentive to cooperate? Each is restrained while a tiny capsule, the size of a grain of rice, is injected into their necks. If a button is pushed the capsule will explode with such force that their head will be blown off. We actually see it work when one of them tries to go rogue at the first sign of conflict.I don't give this movie overall very high marks. There are no good guys, everyone is bad to different degrees. Much of the fighting in the middle of the movie are mysterious faceless creatures. Maybe a fan of all the DC characters would know what they are but for me it didn't seem very interesting.My favorite characters are Margot Robbie playing a goofy but dangerous Harley Quinn. And her boyfriend/lover/husband perhaps, Jared Leto all but unrecognizable as The Joker. And, Viola Davis as the rogue government agent Amanda Waller. The other characters are uninteresting in comparison. Even Ben Affleck as Batman makes brief appearances in Gotham at the beginning and at the end. Can be an interesting 2 hours of entertainment if you like these characters. The ending sets up for a sequel which is already planned."", 'Call it the Rule of Very Low Expectations, but by this rule I had a good time with this movie. It\'s not the Fantastic Four level disaster you\'ve heard. Is it nihilistic? A little, though not anywhere near some other films this year (not to say it\'s as good as those, i.e. Deadpool), and the fact that this was green-lit and conceived in the shadow of Guardians of the Galaxy is painfully obvious (i.e. Killer Croc = Groot, more or less). But David Ayer as a director AND writer, coming from a gnarly, south LA cops-and-criminals kind of cinematic background (remember his breakthrough was Training Day), creates his own playground to work in, and though Batman from the Goddamn Synder-verse appears it\'s really his own making this time - it\'s a colorful film to look at (not as ""artistic"" as the other neon film by Refn, but close), and while it\'s an ensemble it gets two really fantastic actors and anti-hero/villain characters: Deadshot (Will Smith, in the best I\'ve seen him in almost ten years, fully entertaining in his Will Smith but grungier, more cynical, and he is fully acting here and giving it his all even when the script lets him down), and Harley Quinn (Margot Robibie, who I assume was created because she\'s one of those people the camera just loves, and she loves this character and it shows).They\'re the driving force here amid a group of motley characters and actors - some better than others, i.e. it was impossible not to think of Jai Courtney, having fun much as he is, as a discount Tom Hardy since he dropped out of the role, and Jay Hernandez who brings a lot to a character that is basically Fire Hulk - and that helps when it becomes clear that when this Squad that\'s been assembled, with a mostly entertaining series of backstories in the opening act, are put into a fairly generic and problematic plot that climaxes with (uh, spoilers?) the actual homage to Ghostbusters 84 for this summer(!) I think if I looked at the disappointments to have with the film they would be there, like how Cara Delvegine (sic) carries some real screen presence as the villain but she is just another in a long line of comic book movie villains that want to take over/destroy the world for mystifying-stupid reasons, and the Joker is surprisingly completely ancillary to the plot (and Leto makes me pine for Ledger\'s good but overrated performance as the Joker - like, I really miss him now he\'s so snarly and ugly and his-heart-isn\'t-in-this performance). But thinking about the movie some hours after, I find more to like about it than I don\'t: a lot of it comes down to the potential that is here with these characters and their powers, how they play off of one another, their energy and how they appear (Killer Croc is... NOT a CGI creation, yes, it\'s possible!) and how sometimes the plot flashbacks work (again with Diablo, the Jay Hernandez character, I felt Ayer coming through the most via his South LA filmmaking roots, and that\'s a good thing here).So I can nitpick this and it\'s probably a mixed bag. But I was not actively annoyed or bored - climax the one exception - and it provides its actors some strong moments to shine. It\'s not actively brooding or trying to be DARK in some hamfisted way that doesn\'t work. Its flaws are not from some terrible \'moments-driven\' vision like a Snyder, nor is it talky-philosophical like a Nolan film. It\'s as acceptable today as it would be if it had come out circa 2002, which is about right. In other words, it\'s a decent dark-light refitting of the \'GotG\' formula, and it\'s adequate! In this summer of deathly bombs and other BS that\'s fine.', 'It\'s almost suicide just to view this pathetic film from 2016. Will someone please tell me how accomplished Oscar winner Viola Davis subjected herself to such a miserable film.No, this is not exactly 1967\'s ""The Dirty Dozen,"" where deviants are forced to fight the Nazis. This instead is right out of a comic book fancy with unimaginable villains in prison recruited to fight evil forces threatening to destroy the world.There is enough shooting for ten life-times. The special effects is about the only good thing in this mess of a film.My two favorite female deviants in the film were the psychiatrist who went astray due to her love for an inmate and the archaeologist who fell into the wrong underpass and had a negative life-altering experience.It becomes confusing when some of the deviants join with our crusaders.Evil was really never this bad.', 'This film tells the story of a group of bad people with super powers, who are enlisted to help the government to fight against non human entities that have created havoc in Gotham City.I never understood the hype surrounding the film, as the characters look rather disturbing for the film to be fun. After watching it, I can see why there is so much buzz. The characters are properly introduced in depth at the beginning, so I get to know who they are and have a glimpse of how they have come to be. After the introduction, the plot is tight and engaging. It is very cool to watch all the villains doing a super job, blurring the lines between villains and heroes. The evil queen is visually stunning, especially at the end. ""Suicide Squad"" is a good blockbuster to pass time. It has the thrills and jokes to entertain. I enjoyed watching it.', 'With nearly 1400 user comments as of this writing, I will just keep it short and sweet: villains like a sniper working for the highest bidder (Will Smith; he loves his little girl, though!), a former psychologist who fell for psychopath Joker (Jared Leto, more cartoonish mad, not immersed in darkness like Heath Ledger was as the character) and was electro-shocked by him which pretty much warped her mental state turning her into a hot, tattooed maniac (Margot Robbie, who stole the film), among others imprisoned and kept under lock and key until a government Pentagon sociopath (Viola Davis, about as cold-blooded as the villains of the movie assembled) urges the military to allow her to use them for missions, covert and to combat the possible Superman that might not hold onto the same values as the *dead* Caped Crusader did.Jon Kinnaman (The Killing) is a badass soldier Davis puts in charge of the Suicide Squad (coined by Smith when acknowledging that the current mission in this movie might lead to their demise), with a device that holds the lives of the villains in his hands (an explosive device is implanted in the bodies). An ""enchantress"" was discovered in a religious artifact hidden in a cave by archaeologist (Cara Delevingne), taking over her body. Davis has the witch\'s heart in a case and wants her to do her bidding, but the enchantress resurrects her brother, placing his soul (from a similar artifact) in common, getting power from him to combat the heart\'s absence. This plot is just so absurdly silly, that even writing it gives me chuckles. Jai Courtney, of the Divergent movies, is Boomerang, an Aussie safecracker, Jay Hernandez as a gangster with flame as a weapon, Diablo, who has reformed himself after his family was killed during an outburst, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as ""killer croc"" (imagine a croc-man), Karen Fukuhara as the awesome swordswoman, Katana, whose blade when it kills folks traps their souls in it (!), and Adam Beach (wasted) as Slipknot round out the cast. Smith, of course, as Deadshot, brings his star power charisma while Margot Robbie blows away everyone on screen as Harley Quinn. Quinn gets the best lines while Smith is clearly a rung above the others, although Kinnaman is no slouch when the two are together (and they are a lot because the plot adversarially pits them against each other). Courtney is fun, but Hernandez (under Day of the Dead facial makeup) is amazing. Damn good cast in search of a better superhero movie. Leto is hyperactive, with tattoos (Damaged in cursive on his forehead) and gold teeth (?!?!), representing a type of manic Mafioso feared by all. Great scene has Margot Robbie proving to Joker she loved him, dropping off into a vat of goo. The smeared mascara, bikini shorts, ""Daddy\'s Lil Monster"" tight shirt, baseball bat, and ""Love/Hate"" bullet chamber gun; Harley Quinn is quite a showy part for Robbie. The ""machine"" the enchantress whips up with her magic and the monster brother with extending ""arms"" that level everything with this branch-like residue, laying waste to all it attacks are massive special effects sequences, a subway station particularly devastated. The enchantress merely grasps folks and transforms them into hideous monsters with faces that ""bubble"". The Diablo fire god opposing Monster T at the end is impressive. Smith proving to Davis and Kinnaman he\'s a good shot while still in prison is also a highlight. Major problem forced on director Ayer: having to deal with so many characters introduced, as backstories are rushed to get to the mission. Harley Quinn is destined for her own movie.', ""A bunch of super-powered villains are picked by the US government to protect the world against any potential super threats. However they each have a little bomb implanted in their throats. If they rebel or try to escape they'll be killed. Then someone named the Enchantress attacks and plans to take over the world (I think). The villains are let loose to battle her.This movie is pretty good for the first 30 minutes. It sets up the story and characters swiftly and neatly. Then when the Enchantress starts setting up her plot the film falls apart. It makes next to no sense! I kept watching it trying to figure out what the hell was going on! Finally I just gave up. I turned off my mind, settled back and watched things go BOOM for the remainder of the film. It SORT OF makes sense but not if you examine it too closely. The reshoots on the film are obvious and muddy the waters more. There's lots of action and violence and great special effects. I can't fault the acting. Everyone is good in their roles--especially Margot Robbie who steals the show as Harley Quinn. The only bad acting is by Will Smith as Deadpool. Very wooden and uninteresting. Also Batman and Flash pop up briefly, So is it a good movie? No but I had fun watching it. A 7."", ""The crux of most comic book movies is meta-humans (as DC calls them) or superheroes. The quality of that movie will be largely based upon the abilities of said super beings although a good story wouldn't hurt. Now we're at a near saturation point with comic book movies which absolutely necessitates a good tale as well as some very unique skill sets from the heroes. If the skill sets are not very unique those abilities better be displayed in a new and unique way.Suicide Squad was a collection of meta-humans (though one of the members wasn't really meta she was just meh) that were tasked with helping extract a VIP from a super-villain stronghold. Of the members of this motley crew I think Deadshot (Will Smith) was the most likable. He was witty and had the most character. Diablo (Jay Hernandez), Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnouye-Agbaje), and Boomerang (Jai Courtney) were just there and Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) was a nuisance. Her character, beyond being superfluous, was very annoying with her on- again off-again pseudo-Brooklyn accent. But this was the Suicide Squad and I watch comic book movies.The story and the climactic battle were very so-so. Whereas I did have a concerted interest in who won the battle, I wasn't very impressed with the nemesis; and that's a problem. Besides being a demigod type character the main nemesis kept gyrating as though that was the source of her power. It just looked ridiculous.Along with these mankind-hating meta-meanies I wasn't keen on the unnecessary additions of Harley Quinn and the Joker (Jared Leto). I know I'm speaking from a position of Suicide Squad source material ignorance but I'm grading the movie like a novice as most viewers will be. Harley Quinn and the Joker were almost a side story that--beyond being distracting--was irritating. Jared Leto is the third rendition of the Joker (post 1989) and his is the worst in my opinion. Jack Nicholson was somewhat humorous, Heath Ledger was a mad genius bent on anarchy and Jared Leto was just a madman with make-up on and very forgettable. I liked the Squad. They were a group of which the whole was greater than the sum of its parts. I even liked their controller. Spruce up the antagonists, lose the Joker (leave him for the Batman movies) and make Harley Quinn more useful than for eye candy and the movie is a lot better."", 'As the follow-up to ""Batman Vs Superman: Dawn of Justice,"" ""Fury"" director David Ayer\'s DC Comics extravaganza ""The Suicide Squad"" qualifies as a gritty, slam-bang, straight-faced, but formulaic action thriller. Although far from realistic in an any conventional sense, Ayer\'s ensemble epic casts a dark shadow over everything that it depicts and its unsavory psychotic felons tangle with powerful mystical entities from an ancient era. Specifically, the chief villain is almost seven thousand years old and relies on magical incantations. Clearly, the ostensible difference between DC Comics movies and Disney\'s Marvel movies is night and day, with DC preferring the dark, while Marvel basks in the daylight. Unlike The House of Mouse\'s Marvel costume-clad, crime fighters, ""Squad"" doesn\'t sugarcoat either its costume-clad convicts or its sinister shenanigans. Interestingly enough, Twentieth Century Fox\'s three Marvel franchises (""X-Men,"" ""Fantastic Four,"" and ""Deadpool"") land somewhere between DC and Disney. Whereas the ""Captain America: Civil War"" characters survived miraculously to fight another day, some ""Suicide Squad"" characters die. Most of the characters in ""Suicide Squad"" are as repugnant as they are unrepentant, and I don\'t mean just the heinous criminals that the Government has recruited for Task Force X to perform their unscrupulous chores. The trigger-happy dame who assembles these dastards is pretty despicable herself. Unless you\'re a literate DC Comics bibliophile, you may not be familiar with the Suicide Squad but they bear some resemblance to Marvel Comics\' Avengers but altogether lack their charisma. Historically, the first ""Suicide Squad"" bore little resemblance to the cinematic ""Suicide Squad."" Captain Rick Flag and his girlfriend Karin Grace, Dr. Hugh Evans, and Jess Bright battled monsters back in 1959 in DC Comics\' ""The Brave and The Bold."" They were all humans and flew jet-bombers. In 1987, DC Comics\' Legends Crossover graphic series introduced the new ""Suicide Squad"" that consisted of an assemblage of super-convicts, such as Captain Boomerang, Deadshot, and Enchantress, similar to those in Ayer\'s film.As ""Suicide Squad"" unfolds, Superman is still dead and gone. Street vendors sell \'Remember\' T-shirts commemorating the last son of Krypton. Although Clark Kent\'s alter-ego doesn\'t show up for this clash of the titans, anybody with half-a-brain should know that Superman will eventually make an encore appearance. Indeed, Warner Brothers and DC Comics have plans in the pipeline for a ""Man of Steel"" sequel. Nevertheless, Superman is nowhere to be seen here, and an unscrupulous, top-level government official, Amanda Waller (Viola Davis of ""The Help""), fears that the next extraterrestrials may not be as benevolent as the Man of Steel. Consequently, she is mobilizing a gang of costume-clad, super-convicts that she classifies as ""the worst of the worst."" When she presents Task Force X, the National Security Council initially wants nothing to do with it. The Pentagon thinks that Waller\'s idea is foolhardy. In short order, Waller changes their minds. She dispatches one of her motley crew, the witch-goddess Enchantress, aka June Moon (Cara Delevingne of ""Paper Towns""), and Enchantress swipes a top-secret document from Iran that the Pentagon has been desperately trying to seize without success. An ex-Arkham Asylum psychiatrist Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie of ""Focus""); a cream of the crop assassin Deadshot (Will Smith of ""Concussion""); a guilt-stricken pyromaniac El Diablo (Jay Hernandez of ""Hostel""); a sociopathic Australian bank robber Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney of ""Terminator Genysis""); a mutant half-man, half-crocodile cannibal Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje of ""Pompeii""); and a specialized assassin Slipknot (Adam Beach of ""Cowboys & Aliens"") constitute Waller\'s group. Rounding out this diversified outfit of unsavory savages is an implacable female ninja, Katana (Karen Fukuhara), armed with a bizarre samurai sword which traps the souls of all who die by its blade. Actually, she serves to protect the group\'s commander, Special Forces Colonel Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman of ""Robocop""), who has a genius for strategic planning. Oddly enough, Flag is involved romantically with June Moon, an archaeologist who blundered into the wrong cave and encountered the spirit of the Enchantress. Unlike the other members of the Suicide Squad who bide their time in a miserable Louisiana dungeon, June and the creepy Enchantress share the same body. Think of the split-personality of the Enchantress and June Moon as a variation on Doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Whenever Waller requires June to summon the Enchantress, this untrustworthy 7,000-year old sorceress takes over June\'s body. Meantime, an elite team of Seals, led by Captain G.Q. Edwards (Scott Eastwood of ""Fury""), are around to mop up what the Suicide Squad doesn\'t wipe out.""The Suicide Squad\'\' differs from ""Batman Vs Superman."" Although Batman appears momentarily in two scenes while Bruce Wayne puts in a cameo appearance, the costume-clad convicts dominate matters in ""The Suicide Squad."" They carry or conceal standard-issue weapons, and their outfits aren\'t as colorful as either Batman or Superman. El Diablo comes the closest to being a superhero because he can transform himself into an incendiary human torch on impulse. Enchantress makes a strong adversary because she can conjure up things out of thin air. At one point, she summons the spirit of her long-lost brother to help her subjugate mankind. Second, ""The Suicide Squad"" resembles a zombie combat movie. Our anti-heroic team marches through the apocalyptic wreckage of Midway City as if they were soldiers entering a recently bombed city. The Witch-Goddess Enchantress possesses the power to turn Flag\'s own men against him. She kills Flag\'s soldiers and reconstitutes them as her hooligans. In this sense, Enchantress\' army behaves like the zombies from ""The Walking Dead,"" and they whittle down our heroes. If a witch-goddess with an army of zombies weren\'t enough with which to contend, our heroes clash with the Joker (Jared Leto of ""The Dallas Buyers Club"") who pops up as a largely peripheral villain to rescue his sweetheart Harley Quinn.Clocking in at two hours and three minutes, ""The Suicide Squad"" doesn\'t provide enough detail about some characters, but director David Ayes doesn\'t squander a second as he parades the convicts to the brink of extinction.', ""With Superman dead, the world needs a new band of superheroes to step into the breach. Senior US Intelligence officer Amanda Waller comes up with a daring plan - use extreme criminals with special abilities to fight crime, in exchange for them receiving reduced sentences. The band of crime-fighting criminals is officially known as Task Force X, but due to the nature of their mission a more appropriate name would be Suicide Squad. Reasonably entertaining. Starts off very well - the background and scene setting were great and promised much for the remainder of the movie. Unfortunately, the remainder doesn't quite live up to this promise, as the plot loses focus to an extent.This all said, the movie has great momentum and is never boring. There are some great action scenes and dialogue and the performances provide a great energy to the movie. The standout (for many reasons!) is Margot Robbie who is excellent as Harley Quinn. Jared Leto is great as The Joker (the character seems to inspire great performances - thinking Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger in the past). Solid work too from Will Smith, as Deadshot, and Viola Davis as Amanda Waller.After all the criticism of the movie, it was much better than expected. I can only think it was your typical comic book and superhero movie fans who were disappointed, as this movie is a bit different to most of the genre. I've never read the Suicide Squad comics, and generally am not a fan of comic book / superhero movies, so was able to watch with any preconceived ideas of what this should be like. Objectivity helps."", 'The film opens at the Belle Reve Penitentiary. Floyd Lawton (AKA: Deadshot) (Will Smith) is in his cell going at his punching bag. The guards, led by Captain Griggs (Ike Barinholtz), bring Floyd a lousy meal. When Griggs taunts him, Floyd threatens to get him someday. Taking that as a threat, Griggs has Floyd strapped to a chair and beaten by the other guards.Meanwhile, Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) is hanging upside down in her cell (more like a cage). Griggs shows up to see her, and he has one of the guards turn on the electricity on the bars when she gets too close. This triggers a flashback in Harley\'s mind of when she first showed up at the place, having just gone insane.It\'s been months since the death of Superman (a reference to the film \'Batman vs. Superman\'). Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) meets with her associates Admiral Olsen (Ted Whittall) and Dexter Tolliver (David Harbour) to discuss the organization of Task Force X, her idea of creating a team of the most dangerous criminals to combat any possible major catastrophe. Waller pulls out her files and goes through her proposed recruits.She starts with Floyd, who was an expert marksman known as Deadshot. In a flashback, we see Deadshot preparing to take out a target. He goads his employer into doubling his pay, and Deadshot kills his target by having his bullet ricochet off a gate to strike the man. Floyd has a daughter, Zoe (Shailyn Pierre-Dixon). In another flashback, the two were walking together and discussing Zoe moving in with Floyd. Her mother wouldn\'t let her because they both know Floyd is a killer, though he denied it to Zoe. He was caught by Batman (Ben Affleck). Floyd got his gun and prepared to shoot Batman, but Zoe stood in the way and pleaded with him not to do it. Floyd relented and went quietly.Waller\'s next pick is Harley, who was originally a therapist named Dr. Harleen Quinzel. Her last patient was The Joker (Jared Leto). Instead of fixing him, she fell in love with him. The Joker escaped from prison by using Harleen as a hostage. He then tortured Harleen for months until she went insane and turned her into his love slave and eventually his wife. Waller knows that Harley is even crazier and more fearless than Joker, which makes her a very valuable asset. Another couple flashbacks show Joker and Harley in a nightclub where Harley was dancing. He invited her to join him and a gangster he met with named Monster T (Common). Harley offered him company, but he declined out of fear that Joker would be displeased. This got him killed. Later, Joker and Harley made their getaway but were chased by Batman in the Batmobile. The two were ran off the road and into the river. Batman jumped in and found Harley, then took her to jail.Among Waller\'s other picks are Digger Harkness (AKA: Captain Boomerang) (Jai Courtney), a thief that used a bladed boomerang and would double-cross his partners. He was caught by The Flash (Ezra Miller). Next is Chato Santana (Jay Hernandez), a former gang-banger known as El Diablo. He possesses pyrokinetic abilities, and he willingly turned himself in. Then there\'s Waylon Jones/Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnouye-Agbaje), a thug with an unusual disorder that gives him green scaly skin. Croc was treated like a monster, so he acted like one and devoured anyone that crossed him. Waller\'s last pick is Dr. June Moone (Cara Delevignge), an archaeologist who recently came across a cave and found an idol, releasing the spirit of a 6,000-year-old witch called Enchantress. The spirit possesses June, but Waller carries the heart of Enchantress with her in order to maintain control over her. Helping Waller is Colonel Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman), who is motivated because he is in love with June.Waller, Tolliver, and others gather at the Pentagon in Washington DC to discuss the initiation of Task Force X. The chairman is not feeling the plan until Waller tells June to bring out Enchantress. She morphs into the witch and demonstrates her power, with Waller poking the heart to control her, which pains Enchantress and also hurts June once she returns to normal. Waller tells the others in the room that the plan would be for her team to go out in secrecy with no word of the government\'s involvement, and if the villains get caught, they\'ll get ""thrown under the bus"".Waller heads to Belle Reve with Flag and June to continue recruiting. She brings Floyd out and allows him to use an array of guns for target practice. He gives Flag a list of demands, including freedom from his sentence and custody of his daughter. Flag refuses to give into these demands, but Floyd says he was talking to Waller.At night, June morphs into Enchantress. Flag is trying to call Amanda, but Enchantress hits Flag\'s mind with a vision of June dead to terrify him. Enchantress then teleports to Waller\'s home and finds an idol that contains the spirit of her brother, Incubus. She takes the idol and heads to the Midway City train station and finds a commuter (Alain Chanoine) and uses his body to bring Incubus back to life. Reunited, the two discuss Enchantress\'s plan to create a machine to wipe out humanity. Incubus, still in the commuter\'s body, kills three men on the tracks before taking his true form and causing destruction.Waller is alerted to the chaos and decides it\'s time to activate Task Force X. The villains are taken from their cells and injected with nano bombs that will go off if they fail or try to escape. They are brought to a base where they are briefed on their mission, which is to head into Midway City and retrieve a mark. The last recruit, Slipknot (Adam Beach), arrives, where he first punches out an FBI agent. When Flag tells the villains about their set-up, Floyd refers to them as a ""Suicide Squad"". They are given proper outfits and their own weapons to head into battle. Lastly, Flag shows them a tablet with Waller speaking to them and telling them what the deal is. On the ride there, the squad is joined by Flag\'s bodyguard, Tatsu Yamashiro (AKA: Katana) (Karen Fukuhara), a lethal Japanese assassin whose sword contains the souls of those that she kills. Her husband was killed with that sword and his own soul is trapped in there.Meanwhile, one of Joker\'s henchmen finds him in his apartment surrounded by his weapons to tell him about Harley\'s situation. Joker goes to find Griggs in a casino and tortures him until he tells him everything. Joker and his goons then attack the Van Criss research facility where the nano bombs were produced. Joker shows the head doctor that he\'s kidnapped his wife to blackmail him into helping him.Incubus turns Enchantress into a more powerful form when Waller repeatedly stabs her heart. As the squad is flown into Midway City, Enchantress\' soldiers shoot them down and causes their chopper to crash-land. They walk to their destination, but Slipknot attempts to make an escape. He shoots his grappling hook to get out, but Flag sets off his nano bomb and kills Slipknot, proving he was not bluffing.The squad is attacked by mutated creatures (formerly human males) under the bidding of Enchantress, prompting them to utilize their capabilities. Deadshot hits every target, Harley shoots and whacks the minions with her baseball bat, Katana slices them with her sword, and Boomerang uses his weapon, but Diablo sits this one out. Flag is grabbed by the minions, and Harley almost lets him die, but Deadshot reminds her that if he dies, then they all die. She reluctantly saves Flag and kills the minions.Flag leads the squad to a building to find their mark. Harley takes an elevator and is attacked by more minions. She easily kills them before rejoining the squad. More minions attack them, so Deadshot pushes Diablo into unleashing the full might of his fire powers. Diablo incinerates all the minions with one blast.As they walk to their destination, Harley looks down the staircase and she remembers the night she became what she is now. Joker brought her to a chemical plant and convinced her to ""live"" for him. She willingly tossed herself into the vat of chemicals, and Joker jumped in after her, pulling her out and laughing maniacally.In the present, the squad finds a room that Flag enters to find Waller waiting for him. As they discuss their mission in front of four other agents, Waller kills them all since they know too much. The rest of the squad is surprised to find Waller there. Together, they all go to the rooftop for extraction. Unfortunately, the chopper they\'re waiting for has been hijacked by Joker and his men. One of the men deactivates the nano bomb in Harley\'s neck, allowing her to escape with Joker. Waller orders Deadshot to shoot her down with the promise of custody of his daughter. Deadshot shoots but intentionally misses Harley. Waller then orders her men to shoot the chopper down. Harley falls out of the chopper and lands on a rooftop, and she watches as Joker goes down with the chopper.Waller is taken by Enchantress\'s minions and brought to her, allowing Enchantress to get inside Waller\'s mind and learn what she already knows. Enchantress also gets her heart back, giving her more power.Harley rejoins the squad when they come across her on their path. Deadshot finds Waller\'s case file and learns the truth about their mission. He demands an explanation from Flag. Flag admits that three days earlier, he and June went underground together to set something up, but she morphed into Enchantress and abandoned him. The squad ditches Flag as Deadshot heads into a bar to get a drink.In the bar, the squad drinks together with Harley acting as the barmaid in serving them drinks. Deadshot tells them that he knows they\'re just pawns in Waller\'s plan and that they are all expendable. During the conversation, Diablo discusses why he stopped using his powers. He used to have a family, but his wife Grace (Corina Calderon) found out about his life as a gangster, and in a fit of rage, Diablo burned their house down with Grace and their two kids inside. Flag then enters the bar to tell the squad they can go free if they choose, as he breaks the detonator to their bombs. He gives Deadshot letters from his daughter, showing she had written to him everyday. This gives Deadshot the motivation to continue the mission, leading the rest of the squad to join him.The plan is to plant a bomb beneath the station to take out Incubus so that the rest of the squad can get close enough to Enchantress. Croc joins Flag\'s men to head into the sewers and place the bomb. The squad hides, but Enchantress senses them and offers them the things they want the most as she goes into their minds. She shows Deadshot a vision of him killing Batman. Harley sees her and Joker looking normal and starting a family. Flag sees himself with June. Diablo sees himself with his family again. Only he realizes quickly that it\'s a trick. He heads into the fight against Incubus, hurling his fire powers at him before morphing into his true form, a towering fire creature as big as Incubus. Diablo roasts Incubus and holds him in the corner long enough for Croc and the others to place the bomb. Diablo stays there to hold Incubus down as the bomb explodes, killing both of them.The now enraged Enchantress takes on the whole squad, with Croc returning to join the fight. But the witch is far too powerful and evasive for any one of them to get her, so she offers them what they want if they join her. Harley appears to go through with it and approaches Enchantress. However, Harley tricks Enchantress and uses a sword to cut her heart out. Croc then throws a bag of explosive in the path of Enchantress\'s machine, as Deadshot gets ready to shoot at it. Enchantress tries to trick him by making it look like Zoe is there to beg him to not shoot, but Deadshot pulls the trigger and hits the bombs, destroying the machine. Enchantress is now weakened, and Flag holds her heart. He orders the witch to release June, but Enchantress says she won\'t come back. Flag crushes the heart and kills Enchantress. June peels off the witch\'s skin, returning to normal and embracing Flag. As the squad prepares to leave, Waller emerges with her own detonator. She says they only get 10 years off their sentences, with some special privileges.Floyd is allowed to visit Zoe for a brief while before being escorted out by Flag. Croc is allowed to have cable TV in his cell. Boomerang gets moved into solitary confinement for his demands. Harley is given as espresso machine in her cell. Moments later, a group of mercs breaks into the penitentiary and start killing the guards before breaking into Harley\'s cell. The Joker (STILL ALIVE) enters and embraces Harley, whispering into her ear, ""Let\'s go home...""During the closing credits, Waller meets with Bruce Wayne in a restaurant. She asks him for protection in the aftermath of Enchantress\'s destruction, and in exchange, she hands him case files on Barry Allen (Flash) and Arthur Curry (Aquaman). As Bruce leaves, Waller comments that he should ""stop working nights"". Bruce says she should shut her operation down, since he and his new friends will be taking care of things.']"
15,DC Extended Universe,Wonder Woman 1984,7126948,"[""This sequel turns out to be a surprisingly poor affair, suffering from the usual problems like slow pacing, reliance on cheesy humour, and overlong running times that always seem to mar modern superhero movies. The characters are back for a new setting (not that this feels very '80s aside from the satire on greed copied from WALL STREET) but this is almost action-free and the CGI fights are purely by rote. Even worse, we're saddled with the lamest villain in a superhero movie in the form of Pedro Pascal; he's not imposing at all, just mildly amusing, and the ending as such is a real damp squib. How could they get it so wrong with all this money behind it?"", ""It's 1984 in Washington, D.C. Diana Prince (Gal Gadot) fights crime as Wonder Woman. During the day, she works at the Smithsonian Institution where she befriends bumbling newcomer Barbara Minerva (Kristen Wiig). Diana is terribly lonely pining for lost love Steve Trevor (Chris Pine). The FBI needs Minerva to identify a stolen artifact which turns out to be a wishing stone. Diana wishes for Steve while Barbara wishes to be like Diana. Eager TV huckster Maxwell Lord (Pedro Pascal) has been searching for the stone and decides on an unusual wish.The movie feels too long. At two and a half hours, it's not the longest especially for a comic book movie. Nevertheless, it feels very long. While I like most of these premises, some of it could be cut back to speed things up. I don't really like Pascal hamming it up as a TV huckster. I'd rather have him be a simple Scrooge like figure. An evil businessman is a better foil. The actual businessman in the movie can be cut out. Kristen Wiig could be a great addition to the franchise but she needs to build up in the franchise. Maybe she should be a friend who fights along side WW at first and then the second movie can have her turn evil over her jealousy. I'm also not sure about the logistics of the wishes. They need to be better thought out. A lot of this needs to be better thought out like the final turn. If the son is that final turn, he needs to be more prominent in his life. Overall, this movie just feels a little too long. Maybe it needs more jokes to pass the time. The action could be tightened. She could learn to fly quicker. Things could be done even if the running time remains the same."", ""The good points are the beauty of Gad Gadot, the atmosphere of 1980 's, the traces of Spiderman, Aladdin lamp, Cat People and Philadelphia Experiment ( in different form, off course ) and, sure, the intro, not ignoring the fight scenes. But, I suppose, it is enough. It is only expression of desire to use the succes of the first part. And it just works because, out of any form of critic, it has one of films with precise target , an old recipe and performances easy to define as decent . Nothing new but reasonable . So, what you expect is present in this new slice of Wonder Woman adventures."", ""With Wonder Woman bringing much needed colour and verve back to DC Films.Wonder Woman 1984 is two steps back. The inspiration is Batman Returns when it comes to villains.The opening scene has young Diana taking part in a competition where she learns an important life lesson. When you are ahead, quit looking behind you too many times. You will miss the obstacles ahead of you!Set in 1984, Diana Prince (Gal Gadot) works at the Smithsonian and her mysterious crimefighter is still not known as Wonder Woman.The story involves failed businessman Maxwell Lord (Pedro Pascal) who is after the Dreamstone which is being analyzed by the Smithsonian. It has the power to grant a wish. It makes Steve Trevor come to life when Diana unwittingly wishes he was here with her when she is near the stone.Lord is after the Dreamstone to salvage his business career as he realises the extent of its powers.The Smithsonian also has a new geologist. The bumbling and mousy Barbara Minerva (Kristen Wiig) who befriends Diana and is rescued by Wonder Woman when she is attacked in the park. Barbara also wishes that she could be like Wonder Woman and the Dreamstone gives her powers.Barbara is just a lamer version of Selina Kyle, when she realises her powers to the full, she becomes Cheetah rather than Catwoman.That makes Maxwell Lord very much like Max Shreck crossed with the even more unethical Donald Trump. Unfortunately Lord's wish to 'become' the stone and grant wishes to people throws the plot off balance.Maxwell grants people their wishes, in return for something from them to restore his health. However all those conflicting wishes that have been granted throws the world in chaos. Maxwell is destined to have an empire of dirt.The film is too long and poorly structured. The early part of the movie meanders to much. It is too preoccupied trying to recreate the era of 1984. It needed to be tightly plotted with better action set pieces.The film is tone deaf, I think I am not the only one who thought having an actress who served in the Israeli Defence Forces getting embroiled in the Middle East might be a faux pas.Somehow they have managed both misandry and misogyny in the same film. Wonder Woman seems to be saving women and children throughout the movie. However just check out the scenes with Barbara Minerva. The timid version cannot attract male attention apart from a seedy would be rapist.When Barbara transforms, she glams up with six inch heels. As she walks along the street, she has all the men eyeing her up. A subtext that men are only interested in sexy women. The other subtext being if you are a frumpy or a plain woman, forget about men wanting you.At least the mid credit scene was fun for people over a certain age."", ""Gal Gadot returns perhaps the longest legs on the screen back into view. Why do they look sexy in the slit dress and like a tomboy in her costume? Chris Pine, her dead boyfriend also returns as I guess the Star Trek residuals are fading out. We are introduced to the invisible aircraft. A wish crystal is discovered and falls into the wrong hands. I liked the character played by Kristen Wiig. The opening of Diana as a child was great, but didn't tie into the overall film that well, and yes it is supposed to. The script was generic fluff and I still don't know what she did during WWII. Nice end cameo by Linda Carter. Does that means she is going to be in future films? The end speech by Diana was such a bore, I was wishing for the world to end."", ""The first film is outstanding, it's exciting, it's fun, and apart from looking amazing, it has depth.The problem here, it's so slow, and goes on forever and a day, did anything actually happen in the first ninety minutes? There was absolutely no action.Chris Pine felt wrong here somehow, eye candy only, Gal Gadot, I thought she was pretty good, the shining light here, I just felt like she was battling against a miserable script. You could almost sense that she knew the script was no good.The Villains were generally inept.I won't be watching again, 3/10."", 'If you could wish for anything what would you wish for? And don\'t be mean and say you\'d wish this movie didn\'t exist ... that\'s not a nice thing to say or wish for. Also there surely have to be more pressing matters at hand ... if that\'s all your worries ... 99 problems but a ... wonder woman movie ain\'t one of them! Having said and also acknowledging that it is even more evident that Gal is not an acting goddess (sorry for the pun), that also shouldn\'t be something you should wish for ... although I reckon ... maybe that ain\'t such a bad idea.Kidding aside, the movie has a central theme and idea that ain\'t that bad. It actually has a main villain that is excellent. And they a movie is only as good as its villain ... I wish that were true here ... wait no that is not the one wish I want to ... no, I take it back. Oh that was easy ... Ok even more ridiculous plot ""revealed"" or did I, the movie is really so easy to take apart, I almost do not want to watch the Pitch Meeting to it ... but I will because Ryan George is a genius.That also aside, the action sequences are quite good, the visual effects are ok I reckon, though considering the budget this had ... I mean it\'s almost comical to see those CGI creatures jump around in the beginning of the film ... maybe it ain\'t that funny to you, but if you think about it ... it can be funny.And remember those bad (hillarious) soap operas where a character came back that was supposed to be dead/gone? They made up some thing or the other and ... voila. It does build into the story, but do not expect a real explanation or consequences. As a viewer I would be surprised if you won\'t have the whole thing figured out before our characters do ... no surprises there, predictable twists and so forth.So while this is quite the downgrade from the first one, with the movie missing a powerful ending (yet again, see the first one), we are not left with much to enjoy here ... but for those who are either into the whole DCEU or just love to sit back, switch of their brain and have some popcorn fun ... well there are things to celebrate I reckon ... even if it is just about 500 kids that have to be rescued over the course of the movie (pandering much) or the gazillions of damage Wonder Woman lashes out (unnecessarily mostly) to the city, cars and buildings ... but it looks cool.', 'Well, this is somewhat embarrassing from the franchise that gave us the Dark Knight trilogy. It approaches ""Batman Forever"" and ""Superman III and IV"" territory, and those films are over twenty years gone by now. I fully expect Gal Gadot and Kristen Wiig to team up again on Saturday Night Live to reprise their characters here and do this all over again. I\'m really at a loss as to how this film was given the green light, about the only scene that was worth watching and held my interest was the opening set in the past on Themyiscira with the Amazon competition. That was cleverly staged and held an important lesson for the young Diana (Lilly Aspell) as she grew into adulthood. Moving to the \'present\' of 1984, the story and action got messier and messier, beginning with the shopping mall smackdown and all the way through to Max Lord\'s (Pedro Pascal) enlightenment for being such a jerk with his wish fulfillment escapade. Gosh, what were the film makers thinking, and before I forget, just like there\'s no crying in baseball, it\'s not a good idea for your titled super-hero character to break into tears over a wish that should never have been realized. Though the film has a good share of \'10\' ratings by reviewers on this board, a good half of them offer no more than a couple lines in support of their opinion, which to my mind make them meaningless. I hope Gal Gadot has a well defined, self deprecating sense of humor because this will take a while to live down. SNL will be a good start.', 'The first film was a fantastic big screen debut for the DC Comics heroine, this was highly anticipated follow-up, the ninth officially in the DC Extended Universe. It has been delayed a number of times since late 2019, then the COVID-19 pandemic did so again, but I\'m glad I finally got to see it, directed by Patty Jenkins (Monster). Basically, in her childhood, young Diana (Lilly Aspell) competed in a multistage athletic competition on Themyscira against older Amazons. She is disqualified for taking a shortcut during the competition; her mother, Queen Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen), and her aunt Antiope (Robin Wright) lecture her on the importance of truth. In 1984, decades after the First World War, Diana Prince (Gal Gadot) works as a senior anthropologist at the Smithsonian Institute in Washington, D.C. She also continues to fight crime as Wonder Woman. Diana meets new co-worker, Barbara Ann Minerva (Kristen Wiig), who is insecure, unnoticed by others, and tries to befriend Diana. Whilst researching ancient Mediterranean civilisations and antiquities, Diana is handed a mysterious Dreamstone, which seemingly grants wishes upon contact with any user. Both Diana and Barbara both hold the stone and are unknowingly granted their desires: Diana wishes for her deceased lover, Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), whose soul is transported into another man\'s body; Barbara wishes to be ""like Diana"", and slowly becomes beautiful, strong, and powerful. Maxwell Lord (Pedro Pascal) is a charismatic businessman and entrepreneur, but he is actually a fraud with a failing business. Lord visits the Smithsonian, it is clear that he knows the power of the stone and wants to get his hands on it. He manages to manipulate Barbara during a gala night at the institute in order to acquire the stone. He makes the wish to become the embodiment of the stone and gains its power. In doing so, he can grant one wish to a person, and take whatever he desires from them. Over the next few days, Maxwell rises to become a powerful influential figure, while leaving chaos and destruction. Diana is overjoyed to have Steve back in her life, and he is amazed by the many innovations of the future. But Diana realises that her wish has come at a price, as she is slowly losing some of her abilities. Barbara however embraces her newfound beauty and popularity and takes advantage of her strength and powers. Diana, Steve, and Barbara investigate the Dreamstone further, it is discovered it was created by the God of Treachery and Mischief. The stone grants a user their wish but takes their most cherished possession in return, and the only way to reverse the condition is by renouncing their wish or destroying the stone itself. Steve realises that his existence comes at the cost of Diana\'s power. Both Diana and Barbara are unwilling to renounce their wishes and try to figure out another solution. Maxwell is desperate to reach out to as many people as possible to grant their wishes and gain more money and power. He manages to get himself a meeting with the President of the United States (Stuart Milligan), who tells him about a satellite broadcast system that can transmit signals globally. Barbara, desperate to keep her power, is determined to stop Diana from harming Maxwell, and joins him as they travel to broadcast station that he will use to communicate to the entire world, offering to grant their wishes. Steve convinces Diana that she must let him go and renounce her wish, she reluctantly does so and regains her strength, and gains the ability to fly. She returns home and dons the armour of the legendary Amazon warrior Asteria, then heads to the broadcast station. She battles Barbara, who has made another wish with Maxwell, transforming her into apex predator creature Cheetah. After defeating Barbara, Diana confronts Maxwell, who has already communicated to millions of people who make their wishes. But Diana uses her Lasso of Truth to communicate with the world via him, convincing everyone to renounce their wishes, after realising the consequences. Maxwell is convinced to renounce his own wish after realising he will lose his son, Alistair (Lucian Perez). The world is eventually restored, and Maxwell is reunited with his son, telling him the truth about his fraudulent lifestyle. Sometime later, Diana is walking the streets during the Christmas holidays, and she meets the handsome man (Kristoffer Polaha) whose body Steve was inhabiting, and she continues to protect the world. In a mid-credit scene, Asteria (Lynda Carter, who famously played Wonder Woman on television) is revealed to be alive and living among humanity in secret, much like Diana. Also starring Amr Waked as Emir Said Bin Abydos, Natasha Rothwell as co-worker Carol, Ravi Patel as Babajide, Oliver Cotton as Simon Stagg, Gabriella Wilde as Raquel, Kelvin Yu as Jake, and Asim Chaudhry as co-worker Roger. Gadot remains perfect casting as the beautiful warrior princess, Pine is both charming and amusing as he discovers the 80s, Wiig who is normally comedic gives an interesting serious performance, and Pascal is pretty good as the power-hungry villain. I agree that it is little bit long, and the various storylines going on make it a bit messy, but you cannot help but be thrilled by the explosive chase and fight sequences, with fantastic special effects, and one or two good songs, including Frankie Goes to Hollywood, in the soundtrack, an entertaining superhero action. Good!', 'I did actually enjoy the 2017 movie ""Wonder Woman"" quite a bit, so I was definitely looking forward to this 2020 movie from writers Patty Jenkins, Geoff Johns and Dave Callaham.And while ""Wonder Woman 1984"" was definitely a watchable movie, it just wasn\'t really up to par with the 2017 movie in anyway. Why? Well, simply because the storyline felt way too comical and the villains in the movie weren\'t really all that interesting or menacing.The storyline told in ""Wonder Woman 1984"" just fell short of being all that entertaining. Sure, it was a watchable movie, but it was hardly an outstanding or particularly memorable foray into the D.C. world of superheroes. For me, the storyline here felt like something that had been ping ponged around a breakfast table, with the writers just tossing out ideas and settling on something that seemed like something that could be made into a Saturday morning cartoon.Of course it was nice to have Gal Gadot return to portray Diana/Wonder Woman in this 2020 movie, and she was joined with talents such as Chris Pine, Kristen Wiig and Pedro Pascal. I must admit that Pedro Pascal\'s performance was actually the most brilliant and enjoyable in the movie, and his character was the one with the most appeal in the movie. Mind you, as a villain he just wasn\'t all there. I mean, it was more of an average Joe come into power situation, so it took away from the usual superpowered villain stuff you\'d expect to see in a D.C. movie.For me, the whole granting wishes thing concept of the movie just felt out of place, and like something that belonged in a whole different type of movie. It just failed to captivate me, and proved to have little entertainment value in terms of being the focal point of a superhero movie.Visually then ""Wonder Woman 1984"" was all there, just like the 2017 movie was. So the visual effects team definitely worked their magic with this 2020 movie, no doubt about that.While I have now seen ""Wonder Woman 1984"" once, I doubt that I will be returning to watch it a second time, as the storyline just felt out of place and too weak for a movie for Wonder Woman.My rating of ""Wonder Woman 1984"", sadly, lands on a very mediocre five out of ten stars.', ""After the success of Wonder Woman (2017), I expect a lot of DC fans (and Gal Gadot fans) were wishing for a bigger and even better sequel for the beautiful Amazonian princess. Well, they've got the bigger sequel they wanted, but better? Nope... trickster god Dolos seems to have pulled another fast one: WW84 is one terrible scene after another, a film destined for a cult following perhaps, purely because it is so awful.The ridiculous plot revolves around a mythical stone (created by Dolos, the god of mischief) that can grant the holder a single wish, and which falls into the hands of an unscrupulous wannabe oil baron, but incredibly, it's not this singular lame idea that ruins the movie, but rather the countless idiotic things that happen throughout. There are so many bad scenes in the film that listing them all would take an age, but here's some of my 'favourites':Resurrected WW2 pilot Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) doing a 'Pretty Woman' by trying on a range of 'hilarious' '80s fashion. Oh, how I didn't laugh.Steve mistaking a trash can for a piece of modern art. I have no words.Steve being able to fly a fully-fuelled jet fighter, stored at the Smithsonian, without any prior knowledge (with Wonder Woman managing to turn the plane invisible-turns out she's David bloody Copperfield!). Also, they fly the plane very slowly through some fireworks.Wonder Woman doing a quick change into her costume in a moving car.Some dumb Egyptian kids playing football in the middle of a road despite being surrounded by miles and miles of desert perfect for a kickabout.Wonder Woman lassoing a passenger jet (just how long is that lasso anyway?), followed by her lassoing a cloud and a lightning bolt. What's next? Lassoing ideas and dreams?Kristen Wiig transforming into Bombalurina from Cats.And as if all that wasn't terrible enough, the sickening saccharine finalé involves Wonder Woman using her lasso (now normal length) to SHOW the bad guy the truth. Good job they introduced that idea earlier in the film...3.5/10, rounded down to 3 for Gadot's lousy performance: she's a beautiful woman with a great pair of legs (still no match for Lynda Carter, though), but she really isn't much of an actress."", 'So I finally figured out why this movie is called Wonder Woman 1984. That\'s because it takes its inspiration from the pre-Marvel Cinematic Universe superhero movies that are adaptions of the comics in name only. I\'m looking at you, Supergirl, which came out in 1984*.Yes, before superhero movies took over the world, we got movies like Superman IV: The Quest for Peace and the Spider-Man and Captain America TV movies (and Superman III and the Cannon Captain America too, while we\'re at it).In 1984, we were lucky if we got a great superhero film.In 2020, we forgot what that time was like.Directed by Patty Jenkins from a script she wrote with Geoff Johns** and Dave Callaham, based on a story by Johns and Jenkins, this is a movie that people have really hated with a passion. So many people have said that it\'s campy, but they really have no idea what that word means. This is in no way the 1960\'s Batman TV series. It\'s not Barbarella. We could only dream that it could be a tenth of a percent as campy as Danger: Diabolik or Flash Gordon***.It\'s the very definition of a movie that has no idea what it wants to be, the story that it wants to tell or how the characters will learn or grow along the way. It only hamfistedly smashes plot points - Honesty is good! Lies are bad! - with all the subtlety of Obnoxio the Clown.It all starts in the home of the Amazona, Themyscira, where a kid version of Diana Prince competes against the older Amazons and learns that cheating won\'t get her anywhere. This is generally called foreshadowing, but again, this is a plot point hammered home so completely that even Bizarro would find himself saying, ""Me not get it!""We move to 1984, sixty-six years after we last saw our heroine in the last movie, and she\'s spent the decades pining for Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), who sacrificed himself to save everyone from a bomber filled with poison. Now she\'s the senior anthropologist at the Smithsonian, working alongside the mousy Barbara Ann Minerva (Kristen Wiig) when she\'s not foiling robberies at malls that look so garishly 1980\'s that Nightwing\'s first costume would fit right in.Trust me. I was in the 1980\'s. I was eight when they started. Everything in here is exactly the 80\'s marketing people think the 80\'s are. Anachronism abounds to the point that I was expecting Rip Hunter to show up and ask Wonder Woman to fix things. ""Diana! Operation Wolf came out in 1987, not 1984! Per Degaton is ruining everything! The Cro-Mags didn\'t release The Age of Quarrel until 1986 and that kid already has the shirt! Cronos is destroying the time-space continuum! That man is walking a goldendoodle, which wasn\'t bred until 1990! Monarch is back!""That\'s when this film\'s McGuffin comes into play. The Dreamstone can give anyone their wish. Wonder Woman wants Steve back. Barbara wants to be Diana. And Max Lord (Pedro Pascal) wants it all.Yes, Max Lord. The guy who was behind the Justice League International before coming back to kill off Blue Beetle and ruin the DCU for so many people in Countdown to Infinite Crisis.While this isn\'t a mainstream character, it doesn\'t have to be. But the truth is, Wonder Woman 1984 is more Max Lord\'s movie than it is Diana\'s. He\'s the one that takes the journey, who changes and becomes a better person at the end once he sees where his bad decisions have taken him. And much like 1984, the year when comic book movies had nothing in common with their print inspirations, he\'s Max Lord in name only****. He\'s more Donald Trump than L-Ron\'s best pal, but that\'s completely intentional.Within a few days, Lord has pretty much ruined the world with wish after wish*****. Barbara has wished to become an apex predator, a term nobody used in 1984. And Diana has realized that Steve - in another man\'s body that had sex with Diana without consent, which was a major issue with so many people and something that while upsetting is also something fictional with no way of happening in our reality and to be blunt, we got bigger things to be upset about in 2020 - shouldn\'t be back from the dead.And that\'s pretty much it.The biggest sacrifice - Steve going back to death - is made by Steve more than Diana. Barbara never gives up her wish, gets electrocuted and still lives. And Max actually comes out as the person who learns the most, telling his son that he is not a good man.Maybe it\'s the amount of horror and exploitation films that I watch on a regular basis, but movies are best between 66 and 75 minutes. This one goes near double that and I already told you the whole story in a few paragraphs. It drags. And drags. And then drags some more for good measure.It also doesn\'t have any real reason to be set in 1984 other than the title and ""Welcome to the Pleasuredome"" by Frankie Goes to Hollywood getting used in one scene. And yes, to be completely OCD, this movie takes place on the Fourth of July and that song was released until October 29 of that year.It\'s also a $200 million dollar movie that has effects that feel unfinished (just look at the kids turn into obvious dummies when she saves them), a final fight scene that makes the end of Ang Lee\'s The Hulk look well lit and invalidates much of what we knew of Wonder Woman in Justice League, which claims that she was in hiding the whole time. As for those who claim continuity doesn\'t work, the old DCU was the most continuity heavy universe ever. Ask Ambush Bug. And continuity is a major reason why the MCU works so well.That said, Gal Gadot is fine as Wonder Woman, for all she is given to do. Kristen Wiig is playing Kristen Wiig and if you told me that this was the same character she was essaying in the Anchorman sequel, I would have believed you. And I guess Pascal is fine, but by the end of this movie, I was moved to ennui and struggling to say anything nice.I mean, go back and watch that fight scene in the mall. It has almost sitcom level mugging in it. I mean, the worst part for me was when Steve is amazed by an escalator and a subway train. The first movie was set in London during the First World War and all of those things existed there at that time. Maybe Steve is just a moron.There you go. I\'ve spent more time figuring this movie out than it really deserved. Let\'s get back to Jess Franco movies, people.*But some really great comic films came out in 1984. One is based on a comic strip that not many people know called Sweet Gwendoline by John Willie and that would be the strangely great The Perils of Gwendoline in the Land of Yik Yak. The other two aren\'t based on any comic book but get the tone perfect and those would be The Adventures of Buckaroo Bonzai Across the 8th Dimension and The Toxic Avenger.**Who actually wrote some decent comics every once in a while, like DC\'s JSA.***Which is the answer to the question, ""What are Sam\'s two favorite comic book adaptions?""****Just like how its mentioned that the Dreamstone comes from Dolos, The Duke of Deception, who was the first major challenge that Diana faced pst-Crisis.*****One of those wishes is to get his company back from Simon Stagg, who we all know - I\'m joking, like four or five of us know - is the father-in-law of Metamorpho.', 'This is a sequel to the 2017 Wonder Woman, set during WW1 times. This one is 1984 and the new ""war"" is an individual or two trying to take control of the whole world. That is facilitated by an ancient crystal that magically grants wishes.It did not find this one as interesting and entertaining. So to distil it down, what is it about?There is an old John Denver song ""Poems, Prayers and Promises"" and part of the lyrics go like this:""Talk of poems and prayers and promises and things that we believe in How sweet it is to love someone, how right it is to care How long it\'s been since yesterday and what about tomorrow?What about our dreams and all the memories we share?""And in a great sense that is what the movie is ultimately saying, find things to believe in rather than accentuate our differences. I found much of it interesting and entertaining, while I found some of it to be dull and uninteresting. It definitely isn\'t a ""1"" or a ""2"" but it also isn\'t better than about a ""6"" or a ""7"" when compared to other fantasy movies.I watched it at home on BluRay from my public library, my wife skipped.', ""I find this film long and boring. The build up take far too long, and scenes just drag on and on. It doesn't have the powerful touch of the original."", 'A visually stunning movie no doubt, good CGI work, great action coordination, and loved the costumes for Gadot and Wiig. However, the concept was almost laughable at times. The main villain was nothing more than a bumbling idiot running around granting wishes of all things.

A new shipment of artefacts has come in, one of which is a seemingly innocuous, not-very-valuable stone. However, failed businessman Max Lord recognises the stone as the Dream Stone, a stone that grants wishes, and quickly steals it and starts abusing its powers. This puts the world in jeopardy.I'm not a fan of super-hero / comic book movies but didn't mind the first Wonder Woman movie so much. It wasn't brilliant but did have more of a plot than most films in the genre and initially limited the fantasy / sci fi nonsense. The film did revert to type towards the end, with a lame plot and superficial CGI-driven action scenes but for the most part it was entertaining.Wonder Woman 1984 follows roughly the same path: decent plot and set-up in the beginning but then unravels and becomes quite superficial and clichéd towards the end. Gal Gadot's performance in the first film wasn't a problem but here it does set the film back slightly. Maybe there's more dialogue in this one, that's why.Overall: not great, not terrible, entertaining enough."", ""I don't mind the premise of 1984, it's just executed poorly.Has a promising start, but deteriorates the further along. It's basically all phony baloney, a lot like the Spider-Man film I watched the other day, along with Pascal ruining everything he touches."", ""... in that I can enjoy a good one, but film noir and precode are really my preferred genres. From that perspective, I don't think that this movie is nearly as bad as everybody says.There are big plot holes. Why is everybody wearing heavy coats and then suddenly it is the Fourth of July? Why is it OK to kidnap some random man's body from his life? Did he have a family who wondered where he was? Was he losing a job he wasn't showing up to? And how does a WWI pilot - the resurrected Steve - know how to operate a 1980s airplane? This last one is basically the same problem with Independence Day, a much worse movie that people apparently loved.In fact, reading the negative reviews, THAT is what I expected - Independence Day 2020. Hammy acting, over the top dialogue, shrill characterizations, and stuff that doesn't make sense on a much bigger scale than what I actually saw in this film. Maybe it is because people expected more action - this film is more philosophical. Maybe because folks expected more Wonder Woman in a movie that bears her name.About being philosophical, there was one thing I noticed, maybe it was intentional, maybe not. Pre magical powers, Max Lord is a greedy guy, but he is tethered to humanity through the unconditional love of his son. It is what ultimately brings him back from the brink. Kristen Wiig's character, Barbara, is a mousy timid person with zero confidence who was probably bullied as a child. Nobody ever helps her - even when she is being assaulted - unless they take pity on her. It wouldn't be because she means anything to them. When she gets the power to be like Wonder Woman she goes completely wild. For the first time in her life she has confidence and strength. And she is totally unconnected to humanity because nobody ever cared about her or even noticed she was alive, and so the feeling is understandably mutual. So she would die before she would give up that power and go back to what she was - a nobody. So think about that if you ever minimize the gravity of the act of bullying someone - adult or child. It has lasting consequences.Before all of this happened you would have said that Barbara is much more integrated into society than Max is. That's because she didn't have the strength or confidence to NOT be integrated into society.The Han Zimmer score was on point but not overpowering, the acting spot on. I think it is the large as well as smaller themes of the plot and the fact that the CGI seemed amateurish that people noticed. I noticed it. And I've always been a rather easy grader."", ""The year is 1984. For some reason. Diana(Gadot, asked to carry a lot of the movie on her shoulders, and, sadly for all of us, out of her depth) still misses Steve Trevor(Pine, charming as ever, given less to do than last time). You'd think she misses her people, family, home country, more than the guy she knew for a week 66 years ago, but whatever. One day, he mysteriously returns. And a number of people are having wishes granted. Can something like that happen without serious consequences? And is it possible to include a moral message about that, without getting extremely condescending?This is a mess. While I wish it was significantly better, I won't let my disappointment affect this review, I will be entirely honest. The tone is again partially that of the Christopher Reeves(RIP) Superman movies, especially the first two, except for when it's gritty and harsh. Those two approaches clash. A lot of the acting is reminiscent of the Sam Raimi Spider-Man movies, which works a lot of the time there, yet rarely here. The storytelling is sloppy, with countless instances of people somehow guessing where to go(and what to do, and what is happening), superpowers with inconsistent rules and sometimes lasting only one seem never to be mentioned before or after. It seems as though the Golden Lasso can do absolutely anything that they felt like it could at that moment. You have to look pretty hard to find a bigger fan of Patty Jenkins than me. I've watched Monster over two dozen times, before the release of Birds of Prey the first Wonder Woman solo movie was easily my favourite DCEU entry, and honestly I do still think she has more amazing movies in her. I don't think the blame lies entirely on her for the low quality of this film. It appears to me that it was butchered in the editing room, with the unusually long post production allowing for way too many producer notes, as studio people got cold feet about certain aspects of this. That would explain why so many things in this are poorly set up and/or go unresolved.This features disturbing material. I recommend it only to the biggest fans of the people who made it. 4/10."", '70-odd years after leaving Themyscira for The World, kicking the doodoo out of war god Ares, and losing the love of her life Steve Trevor in a self-sacrificial explosion, Diana (aka Wonder Woman) is peacefully spending her days on antiquities at the Smithsonian while doing some freelance Wonder Womaning in high-profile secrecy. Enter geeky and socially inept Barbara Minerva, and overstretched would-be oil mogul Maxwell Lord. Factor in a mysterious artefact with potentially devastating powers, not to mention the equally mysterious return of Steve Trevor (hang on, wasn\'t he dead? Could the two be connected?) and the plot is all set to go.This film is enjoyable big budget fun. The cast are all good, with Kristen Wiig outstanding in a part which requires her to steer a steady and believable course from high comedy to menace. The action and effects sequences, at their best, are excellent, although the Egypt highway and final Cheetah sequences are sometimes a little difficult to follow.Oliver Cotton\'s Simon Stagg looks amazingly like his comics counterpart.But the film is a poor relation to its predecessor. The first film had substance, but this does not. It overstays its welcome in a number of areas - far too many scenes of people running randomly around in order to signify chaos, for instance. And the opening flashback to Diana\'s childhood, while fun, serves little narrative purpose other than to make the statement ""Lying isn\'t good"" so that we recognise that later on.In fact, my main criticism is that I was all too aware of elements being inserted for emotional payoff purposes rather than genuine dramatic plot development purposes. Barbara\'s comical social ineptitude is there not to show Barbara\'s character, but to provide a contrast for her personality change. Max Lord\'s son is there solely to give us a reason to root for Max\'s redemption at the end. It\'s all a bit calculated and heartless.How come Barbara knew to turn up at the White House? And how did she get in?I still enjoyed it, though.', 'Greetings again from the darkness. Some of the key elements that make Wonder Woman appealing is that she\'s smart, she\'s nice, she\'s dedicated to doing good, she\'s grounded in her history, and her use of her powers makes sense (in a comic book kind of way). Most of that holds true in filmmaker Patty Jenkins\' sequel to her 2017 blockbuster WONDER WOMAN. So why did that one work so well, while this one falls short? It\'s not an easy question to answer, though it could be as simple as having the wrong target.Gal Gadot returns as Diana Prince, and this time she\'s plopped into 1984 (the year, not the novel). This creates a cornucopia of opportunity for social commentary and satire from Ms. Jenkins and her co-writers Geoff Johns and Dave Callaham. After all, it was the era of atrocious popular music, outlandish fashion, and a relentless pursuit of greed by the ""me"" generation. The film pounces on each of these by using the return of Diana\'s main squeeze, Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), as a device for highlighting the absurdity of belly bags and pastel tank tops for men. In the first movie, the WWI pilot wakes up in Themyscira, and this time, he just kind of materializes in the year of GHOSTBUSTERS, shopping malls, and President Ronald Reagan. While this certainly qualifies as extreme culture shock, the parade of outfits and Steve\'s wide-eyed tour through the city are over-the-top, even for their attempted comedic effect.Over-the-top also describes the film\'s two main villains. Pedro Pascal (""Game of Thrones"") plays TV hypester and con man Maxwell Lord. He\'s a greedy, self-centered man willing to do anything to get ""more"". Kristen Wiig is Barbara Minerva, a bumbling, forgettable klutz who works at the same museum as Diana. She simply wants to be cool like Diana and have people acknowledge her existence. Things shift quickly thanks to the Dreamstone sitting in Barbara\'s in-box waiting for research. What follows is more than two hours of seeing the fallout of people having their wishes come true. If you\'ve learned anything about human nature during this pandemic year, then you won\'t be surprised at how people react to gaining power.Maxwell Lord is not dissimilar to Lex Luthor in SUPERMAN (1978), as his goal is ultimate power and control - though to what end, he\'s not sure. Barbara Minerva was never really power hungry, but a taste of it was much to her liking, and she transitions to The Cheetah for Wonder Woman\'s biggest fight scene. There is also a message about what one sacrifices to have their wishes come true. This aspect of the film could be psychoanalyzed were one so inclined. Lord\'s relationship with his son is convoluted, and the early Barbara is a mess ... making their ""sacrifices"" a bit less obvious than that of Diana.The opening sequence is the one this viewer most enjoyed. Spectacular camera work takes us to a competition on Themyscira, as a very young Diana (Lilly Aspell returns) goes against the grown warriors, while Antiope (Robin Wright) and Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen) look on and teach hard life lessons. Not only do these actors return, but most of Ms. Jenkins\' WONDER WOMAN crew is back, including cinematographer Matthew Jensen. The changes include Film Editor Richard Pearson and Hans Zimmer provides the new score. Some of the dialogue is tough to take. As an example, Diana says ""I don\'t know what to think, Steve. I only hope I\'m wrong."" And later, Steve explains, ""Flying is easy. It\'s only wind and air."" Dialogue like this makes us want to renounce our own wishes. It may be one film later than it should have been, but Ms. Jenkins does deliver a much-appreciated cameo at film\'s end, and if nothing else, it leaves us wondering, \'what would you give up for a wish?\'', 'This movie has some really bad points. It isn\'t the worst action hero movie ever. It\'s 80% bad with some redeeming qualities here and there. Firstly the bad points: 1. The story. This silly ""wish"" premise is weak and wears thin very fast. Be careful for what you wish for. Even a 1984 movie wouldn\'t have such a simplistic premise. It gets too overblown at the end. The writers really did a bad job. It\'s beyond low mentality and cliched. And things really fizzle out at the climax. 2. Long winded scenes. Many scenes could have been cut in half to keep the momentum going. From the overlong competition in the beginning, almost every scene could have been trimmed by a quarter. The good points: 1. Gal Gadot is watchable and likeable - she could read the phone book and it would be watchable. 2. Pedro Pascal of Narcos is the villain here and he looks quite different - good that he has a big movie role. 3. Kristen Wiig has a remarkable transformation and her character is quite interesting. 4. Watch out for Lynda Carter. The cast is good but they can\'t save a bad story. Chris Pine looks a bit haggard. 5. The production values are fine - it is a big budget movie. And the cinematography is good.They had better think carefully about who they get to make Part 3.', ""I did like Wonder Woman and here we have it, the blockbuster from the Covid-19 era, the number one. So happy it came out on Christmas and so happy they put it on streaming services to watch it over here because all theatres are closed.But what the hell was this? A great opening that's for sure and off we go to the story itself with Wonder Woman rescueing and catching some burglars in amall, all great but from there the story goes to, well, nothing at all. It do has a few moments that are great but what about the fireworks, really? The flying of Wonder Woman, takes ages. The end battle, before it starts, well well, not that good after all.Wtached it with my 13 year old daughter, she liked it very much (has seen Wonder Woman 3 times and has seen The Joker and Dark Knight) so she really is into superheroes, but for me it was just above mediocre, did like Barbara, the villain, seeing her transform from nothing to mention to what she became, that was okay.So they decided to make part 3, hopefully with some more fight scene's Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 5/5 Story 2/5 Comedy 0/5"", 'I am no expert in comic books myself, but what I expect from a comic book movie is to be striking, visual, stereotypical and above all, consistent with its past and its planned future. WW84 was neither of these! It wasn\'t awful for a random movie made by students, but it was really bad for a film made by a major studio and starring talented people and having so much material to draw inspiration from.First of all, Gal Gadot had a supporting role in this film. She may save the day at the end (well, sort of), but the main character of the story was Max, the villain. Then every other supporting cast member had a development arc, while Gadot had about half of one if I am being generous. Second, the story pushed in the invisible jet and that Wonder Woman can fly (!?) in a clunky and hard to stomach way. You almost saw the outline of the executive shouting ""she needs to fly in the next movie!!!"". And third I am wondering if this film was misandric or not. Men were consistently portrayed as weak, abusive, violent, lacking impulse control and heartless. If it weren\'t for three male characters whose only quality was they were not evil - and that includes Steve Trevor and the random guy he inhabited, I would have seriously felt under attack the entire film.The result was something that felt like a draft story for a writer class, with bad CGI, improbable deus ex solutions to problems that were hard to swallow in the first place, underwhelming characters, poor action scenes, pointless Trevor appearance, unnecessarily physical solutions to problems that could have been tackled by simply talking to a person on a phone or something and so on. And the ending was about how nice the holiday season is after a catastrophe that affected every person on the planet and almost destroyed the world!So no. No! I am not taking it anymore. I am tired of movies that are not made for children but assume I am one, and a dumb one to boot.

Diana\'s mother, Queen Hippolyta, and her aunt Antiope lecture her on the importance of truth, because ""no hero is born from lies"".In 1984, decades after the events of World War I, Diana works as a senior anthropologist at the Smithsonian Institute in Washington, D.C., specializing in the culture of ancient Mediterranean civilizations. Diana continues to fight crime as Wonder Woman, albeit while maintaining some anonymity. At work, she meets Barbara Ann Minerva, an insecure woman who idolizes and envies Diana for her beauty and confidence and befriends her. After Wonder Woman foils an attempted robbery, the FBI asks Barbara to identify a cache of stolen antiquities from the robbery. One item both women take notice of has an inscription in Latin.Businessman Maxwell Lord visits the Smithsonian under the guise of making a donation. Secretly, he covets the ""Dreamstone,"" hoping to save his failing oil company. Both Diana and Barbara unknowingly use the stone to fulfill their own desires. Diana wishes for her deceased lover, Steve Trevor, to return, causing his soul to take over another man\'s body. Barbara wishes to become strong and beautiful like Diana. During a gala night at the Smithsonian, she meets Maxwell, who seduces her in order to gain access to her office so he can take the Dreamstone. He wishes to become the embodiment of the stone and gains its power to grant wishes, while also able to take whatever he desires in return.Maxwell becomes a powerful and influential figure as his body begins to slowly die, while leaving chaos and destruction in his wake as his wishes trigger instability and conflict. Barbara, Diana and Steve investigate the Dreamstone\'s powers further and discover that it was created by Dechalafrea Ero - the god of treachery and mischief. The stone grants a user their wish but exacts a toll. The only way to reverse the exchange is by renouncing the wish or destroying the stone itself. Steve realizes that his existence comes at the cost of Diana\'s power. Both Diana and Barbara are unwilling to renounce their wishes, so they try to find alternative solutions.Maxwell, upon learning from the President of the United States that the US satellite broadcast system can transmit signals globally, decides to use it to grant wishes to the entire world, inadvertently giving the United States more nuclear weapons which threatens to start a nuclear war with the Soviet Union. Barbara joins forces with Maxwell to prevent Diana from harming him. Steve convinces Diana to let go of him and renounce her wish, regaining her strength. She returns home and dons the armor of the legendary Amazon warrior Asteria, then heads to the broadcast station and battles Barbara, who has been transformed into a being of pure rage after wishing to become an ""apex predator"". After defeating Barbara, Diana confronts Maxwell and uses her Lasso of Truth to communicate with the world through him, convincing everyone to renounce their wishes. She also shows Maxwell a vision of his son, Alistair, wandering the street as chaos ensues from his fulfillment of everyone\'s desires. Maxwell renounces his wish and returns home to reunite with his son, averting global thermonuclear war.Some time later, Diana meets the man whose body Steve was inhabiting, while she continues to protect the world.Ultimately, Asteria is revealed to be alive and living among humanity in secret, very much like Diana.']"
16,DC Extended Universe,Wonder Woman 2017,451279,"['I wanted to like Wonder Woman, but I just can\'t get aboard the hype train. It\'s really the same as every other cartoonish, overblown comic-book action movie, except with a female protagonist.Actually, this is worse than the average comic book movie, because it preaches to the audience about pacifism but then hypocritically celebrates ""heroic"" violence. In other words: Wonder Woman is an alleged pacifist who kills a bunch of people. Wonder Woman is also an alleged feminist, who allows Steve Trevor to drive the entire plot and basically steal the movie from her. Really, this thing is about as progressive as Dick Cheney\'s great-great grandfather.I could forgive Wonder Woman\'s flimsy social commentary, if it were any good in other respects. But the plot is loose and shabby, the CGI is poor, and about half the scenes were shot in front of a green screen. Sometimes, I couldn\'t tell if I was watching a real movie, or Patty Jenkins playing God of War on her Playstation 2. (When exactly did cinema and video games blend into this horrible hybrid art form, which has none of the beauty and charm of old-school cinema?)And don\'t get me started on the villains. The World War I era Germans are depicted as cartoonishly eeeevil, while the same era\'s British Empire is held up as a heroic ideal. Meanwhile, the main villain is a nightmare of bad CGI, who looks like he belongs on a 1980s heavy metal album cover. Naturally, they got a wonderful actor for this stupid part and wasted him entirely.Perhaps I\'m going overboard on criticisms, but we need some balance to the rapturous praise this film has received. Movie fans often accuse professional critics of being too harsh, but lately, I think critics have actually become too lenient. Mainstream movies get dumber, louder and tackier all the time, and they are increasingly substituting mawkishness for real emotion and character development. And yet the critics have given this thing a great Rotten Tomatoes rating!

Most of the movies are downright idiotic but it still makes money because it\'s.....Transformers. So all popular comic book hero movies will make money period. I can\'t make sense of the movie and I really don\'t think the writers knew either. Her morales flip flop, the bad guy has no real reason to be ""bad"", the good guy has no real reason to ""die."" The side characters really didn\'t serve much of a purpose.Some parts of the movie are decent and a few seconds later, the same scene turn into a total crapfest. The 3rd part is an utter mess and that act alone should be more then enough reason to keep WW off the top of the charts but somehow has a 94% rating on RT? That right there shows you that ratings are padded because you can\'t have at least 1/3 of a movie be total trash, 1/3 of the movie just corny dialog and somehow end up at the top of the charts.', 'Drivel Shocked how high the rating is for this boring snorefest.Utter drivel. Waste not your life on this farce.

I mean it was so predictable and, as usual, they tried to gloss it with CGI.Honestly, it is better than total rubbish like Thunder Force because the actress is smooth and has lickable thighs (3 stars just for that), but otherwise five it up.', 'Whether or not you\'ll love ""Wonder Woman"" no doubt will depend on the individual. The die-hard superhero film lovers have embraced the picture and it\'s setting box office records...and these folks really shouldn\'t read or pay much attention to my review. This is because I am over 50 and got tired of the genre long, long ago. I went to quite a few of the films because my daughters love them and this time was was actually taken to the theater by my wife, as she loves the idea of a female superhero. So, if you fall into my demographics...this review is for you!The story is pretty different from my concept for ""Wonder Woman"". This is NOT a complaint...I know a lot of superhero stuff changes. But instead of the WWII setting I expected, the film was set during the final days of WWI. The history teacher in me was intrigued...especially since they actually got the look of the film just right--costumes, airplanes, soldiers, etc.. They also heightened the bleakness of the era by severely restricting the color palate to shades of gray and brown--even the reds looked rather brown. I think this was a good choice...after all, war is horrible. Overall, there really wasn\'t much to dislike about the film. It had TONS of CGI and action...and that is what many fans want. As for me, I would have liked a bit less and more focus on story....but that is a very typical complaint for folks like me! However, if you do get pulled into going to see it, it won\'t bore you and offers a few nice twists.By the way, if you saw the film as well, were you ALSO horribly disappointed when the lady scientist\'s mask came off like I was?! I was expecting so much worse.', ""After watching this and Melissa Mccarthy's stupid movie this year i feel the creativity and desire to make something good or even half good has disappeared and they are just dishing out garbage.Look, honestly, is the agent and studio head and VP etc did Gal Gadot then good for them. It started on the couch and ended up at their pad. I am jealous, but you have now fulfilled your promise to her and it is time to let her go. She is so boring and cannot even say the words. I would gladly watch her in R movies but stop dishing out punishments to audiences."", ""I'm definitely the minority here, but I can't get over the fact that this film is rated higher than films like Enter the Void, Moonlight, The Kings Speech, Spotlight and sooo many other much better films. The critics took the money on this one and ran. To me, this film was cheesy, campy, and completely missed the mark. The ridiculous costume that is clearly symbolic for America ( there's clearly a fuc*ing gold eagle on her chest and it's red white and blue), yet she hails from Greece and calls herself an Amazonian God - WTF?!! AMAZONIAN!?!?!? I was so confused. Then, there is an American who is a British Spy (huh?) Most of the German Nazis speak with British accents and she can deflect bullets yet she loses her hearing to explosions.... I'm sorry, but I just could not get past this to enjoy the film. As an origin story, it's completely ludicrous. Maybe it worked back when the comic was written, but today it just comes off as a desperate attempt to pry the money from people that want to be viewed as politically correct. If you study film and take movies seriously, you should avoid a visit to the theater for this one. Watch it at home for free and make your own opinion, but I can see this media-con being laughable in 20 years."", 'That would be my explanation how anyone gave Gal Gadot a role. Weird. So bad with her words and wording.This movie was terrible!! I can say it was boring too. Patty Jenkins is silly and an amateur!! This movie has all CI for everyone to hide behind. Gal Gadot gave a drama school performance and Steve Trevor was bad perhaps reacting to a silly script. After this movie, I can say DCEU is finished.', 'This was disappointing. The rating is too high. The story was trying hard to create villains and hide a surprise and a reveal and instead managed to drag things out and become boring. The acting was bad. Actress was hiding behind the effects and should do B movies.', 'So, okay, this is a better movie then Suicide Squad (duh!) and it is an enormous leap forward from the absolute horrific stupidity of BvS, but is WonderWoman really a good movie? Well, nah, not really. It is decently entertaining and it does have several redeeming traits, but sadly not a very good movie. Let us start with the bad. The CGI is horribly bad. It is so obvious and so badly done I keep wondering if this movie was made in the early 1990\'s. I saw this movie the day after seeing Agents of Shield season finale, and AoS had 10-times better CGI. Did they not get money to do a WW movie? The story moves way, way too fast, throughout the movie. They jump from this to this and there is no time to breath, catch up with characters or develop any sense of location. It feels like this movie should have been 2 hours longer and I can only assume it was cut down to fit the American public that love fast pace action set pieces. Diana is a kid, swhoosh, Diana is training, swoosh, Germans are evil and let this Jewish woman go kill them for some reason. Then they jump on a boat and faster than The Flash they are in London, and then swoosh they are in the war, then dancing and then off fighting and whopidoda the movie is over. I got the feeling I was fast forwarding 10-15min all the time. Did they cut out 2 hours? Was the script this bad? The villains were pretty boring and badly flushed out. People keep complaining about Marvel villains, but this was far worse and in a fast pace movie like this you really do need to feel the strength and power and immense danger of the villain(s), but in this movie you do not. Not at all.I also need to mention that I hate that the ""hero"" is fighting the poor Germans in WW1, of course the central powers and Germans were the good guys in WW1 (as far as such things goes in a world war\x85), but the propaganda must go on\x85The good? Well, Gal Gadot is good as WW, most of the supporting characters are good as well. Most of the action, if you can ignore the bad CGI, is good. The general story, if ignoring all the plot holes, is compelling and there are a lot of fun and great moments in this movie. There is a good/great movie here somewhere, but it is cut away and hidden under badness. If you can relax and just enjoy the ride and not let the bad elements mention above take you too much out of the movie this is okayish. I give the movie a 4 out of 10. It is entertaining after all, but not as good as Man of Steel which is still (to me) the best of the DC movies and also, strangely enough, the DC movie with least Christ-imagery\x85 Are all DC characters supposed to be God? Or Gods? Is that the point? Boring. Edit: Just saw the movie again last night and having time to focus on the movie and how good/bad it is, I detected a lot of other issues, inconsistencies and weirdo plot holes I missed the first time around. Consequently I will lower my score to a 3 out of 10.', ""So in the current era where the media and Hollywood really try to give us more movies with female main characters, Wonder Woman is for me the main and only example of how to get it right. How ? Simple. Actual character development through a good story and good writing and likable side characters. Especially Steve Trevor played by Chris Pine. The visuals are great (although at the end I question the CGI for Ares) but the reason I'm giving it only 9 stars is because the villains are nothing to write home about. They get the job done, but that's it. They're still better than Steppenwolf though."", 'It is OK. Films are all cliche nowadays and have too much special effects instead of story... and acting and this one is not different. The actress is not even average in my opinion.', ""My dislike of it could be understandable since I dislike superhero movies for some reason; they just bore me. I'm not the biggest fan of action but I prefer a little action in stories.This movie starts off with Diana reminiscing about her 5-year-old self. She wants to train in fighting and even recklessly jumped off a ledge.Later, the movie time-skips to a pre-teen Diana in disbelief about what she's supposed to be doing.I dislike dramas and not that big on war films so that's three things this movie has that I don't like. The action was too fast for my brain to handle (I don't know what they put in those scenes to make it hard to keep up with) This movie had too much crying and sadness from people in it for me. Even an annoying baby crying voice. The melodrama this movie had made me cringe and get nervous and this is the first film I walked out on. I don't like wasting money on movies but mommy and a therapist told me if a movie starts to make me nervous, I can leave.This is the worst movie so far that I've seen in 2017 and that's saying a lot since Snatched could be considered the worst from the general public but I don't know Amy Schummer enough, nor do I have a disdain for her to hate it like other people do. But it was also not that good of a movie anyway so I could kind of understand why people don't like it."", 'Grade: A-Rating: PG-13, 141 minutesIn a Nutshell: I used to watch Wonder Woman on TV back when I was a little girl. I loved it. I thought she was beautiful, kind, and strong. As a little girl, it made me feel like I could do almost anything. Yep, this superhero movie is about female empowerment, but it has a lot more than that.I don\'t know why it has taken this long to bring Wonder Woman to the Big Screen. Maybe we were waiting for the perfect Gal Gadot.This fun action flick has just the right amount of humor and Justice League magic. Warner Brothers gives us an extremely entertaining summer popcorn blockbuster that gives Marvel a run for its money. It\'s part of a set up for Justice League and a planned trilogy for Wonder Woman.Uplifting theme: ""If you see something wrong happening in the word, you can either do nothing or you can do something."" - Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) ""What one does, when faced with the truth, is more difficult than you would think."" – Diana/Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) ""It is our sacred duty to defend the world."" – Diana/Wonder Woman ""Everyone is fighting their own battles, Diana, just as you\'re fighting yours."" - Sameer ""A promise is unbreakable."" - Diana ""Only love can truly save the world."" - Diana Love vs. hate, peace vs. war, humanityThings I liked: Gal Gadot and Chris Pine are both gorgeous and awesome. As Chris Pine\'s character explains, ""I am above average."" Gal Gadot has the perfect accent to sound exotic. As Sameer says about her, ""OMG, that is a work of art."" Eye candy for everyone. Great female stunt work. Some cool and fun slow-motion, as well as sped-up action sequences. Female director Patty Jenkins was going to film Wonder Woman back in 2005, but she became pregnant and the project was put on hold. She said she was thrilled to be able to pick up the project again, because it was the movie she had been wanting to make her whole life. She\'s the first woman to direct a superhero film with a female protagonist. We haven\'t seen a female superhero since Electra in 2005. It\'s about time, right? Most of the CGI is very good, although it becomes a bit heavy towards the end. Gal Gadot was actually 5 months pregnant during some of the filming, so they put green screen on her belly so they could remove the baby bump during post-production. I love it when the directors and producers put themselves in small cameo performances in their own films. In this case, producer Zack Snyder shows up as a World War I soldier. Did you know this movie has been banned in Lebanon? Gal Gadot is Israeli and even served in the military. Ah, romance. I love that both Diana and Steve learn from each other and make one another better. I wish I had one of those truth lassos. It was cool to see the symbolism of light and color illustrated in man\'s world and that of Themyscera. The soundtrack was noticeably good.Things I didn\'t like: There are a couple of long, explanatory scenes to help you understand what\'s going on. I wish Lynda Carter, the first TV Wonder Woman, could have made a cameo performance. Apparently, she sings in cabarets and couldn\'t fit it into her schedule. She definitely should have made the time for her fans. The villain was pretty weak.Interesting lines: ""You let this little thing tell you what to do?"" – Diana/Wonder Woman talking about Chris Pine\'s watch. ""You know that if you choose to leave, you may never return."" – Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen) ""Who would I be if I stayed?"" – Diana ""What kind of weapon kills innocents?"" – Diana ""In this war, every kind."" – Steve Trevor * ""I believe in love."" - DianaFunny lines: ""How could a woman ever possibly fight in this?"" – Diana ""Fight? We use our principles. Although, I\'m not opposed to using fisty cuffs, should the need arise."" – Etta (Lucy Davis) ""Please put down the sword."" – Steve ""It doesn\'t go with the outfit."" – Etta ""Welcome to jolly \'ole London!"" – Steve ""It\'s hideous!"" – Diana ""Yeah, it\'s not for everyone."" – Steve ""You\'re a man."" – Diana ""Yeah. I mean, don\'t I look like one?"" – Steve ""Stand back! Or maybe not."" – Steve ""I\'m both frightened and aroused."" – Sameer (Said Taghmaoui) ""You should be very proud!"" – Diana after she tastes a vendor\'s ice cream. I feel that way about great ice cream too. ""May we get what we want. May we get what we need. But may we never get what we deserve."" - men\'s toast at campfireTips for parents: You see a LOT of Chris Pine\x85bare naked after a bath while he covers his junk with his hands. Lots of violence, destruction, and explosions. At 141 minutes, it\'s a long movie that a lot of little ones won\'t be able to sit through. In the comics, the war is WWII, but the director chose to highlight WWI in the movie. Parents might need to explain the differences between those two wars.', 'All I saw was Gal Gadot trying to act as Wonder Woman, and not doing a very good job.', 'When it comes to women superheroes, it seems that they have more of a prominence within comics rather then their film adaptations. A lot of that has to do with that there are simply more men then women that even wear the capes, as it seemed that the image of the comic book seemed more like a boys thing. Of course that\'s far from the truth as not only plenty women read comic books, but comics themselves have proved that they can be an art. So for each Spider-Man, Batman, and Iron Man, where are the women heroes like Captain Marvel, Batgirl, and of course, Wonder Woman? Like how comics had to prove that there\'s room for heroes of all genders, film had to do something similar. It\'s too bad we couldn\'t have started with both men and women, but that\'s just how society is. Previous attempts to portray women as superheroes have fallen short with awful movies like Supergirl, Catwoman, and Elektra. It\'s hard to pinpoint where those went wrong, bit I think it was a matter of trying to be too different from the regular superheroes. Everyone can rest easy as Wonder Woman not only gives us a good DC movie, but a great woman-led superhero film.On the hidden island of Themyscira, which is home to the Amazon women, young Diana is the daughter to Queen Hippolyta (played by Connie Nielsen) and Zeus when she was sculpted out of clay. Diana would like to train to be a fierce warrior, though her mother refuses it. This leads Diana to be secretly trained by her aunt and General of the Amazons, Antlope (played by Robin Wright). Things seem fine as Diana (played by Gal Gadot) proves to be quick on her feet and strong, until a planes crashes near their waters.Diana rescues the pilot Steve Trevor (played by Chris Pine) who turns out to be a captain from the United States Army Air Service in the crisis of ""The War to End All Wars"". Steve convinces Diana that the Amazon women would be in great danger while Diana starts to think that that it\'s all the cause of the god of war, Ares. Knowing she can handle the ""God-Killer"" sword, she accompanies Steve to England to find out where Ares would be during the Great War. Meanwhile, the Germans are working on more methods to fight forward with the help of General Ludendorff and the mad scientist Dr. Poison.Wonder Woman has figured out why the previous female led superhero movies have failed and why the others work; because they care. It\'s clear that director Patty Jenkins understands that you don\'t need to try something too different, but rather fresh. Wonder Woman uses a familiar setup of a ""team up plot to defeat the villain"", but it has a radical feel to it all because you can tell that the people behind this care about their character. Much of the dark tone from Man of Steel and Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice is gone in favor of something more lively (though it does have grim moments).One of the stronger points of Batman V Superman was Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman. This movie shows she\'s a good enough actress to carry herself throughout. What makes it smart that aside from being a fish out of water scenario for our hero, the Chris Pine character has one too on the island of the Amazons. This allows a reintroduction to Wonder Woman as she starts to understand the humans and how some of their actions may not come from the gods. It\'s a true character arc that not even Marvel seems to be doing a lot of.What I also like is that it\'s never trying to push the ""women rule!"" feel (similar to the Ghostbusters from last year) that hard in favor of a ""men and women working together"" tone that seems like something that everyone will like. Her willingness to want to save everyone while accepting that many of victims of circumstance not only having me feel good about our heroine, but even had me think about some of the flaws of the original Captain America movie that had a ""good vs. evil"" style war.I\'ll give this ten lassos of truth out of ten. Wonder Woman is not only the best DC cinematic universe movie, but feels like a fresh breath of air within the superhero bubble that only seems to be getting bigger. It works as an action movie, a comedy, a movie about World War I, a drama, and above all, a great superhero story about ones evolution. It only seems like that this was sculpted by the same gods who made Diana.', ""WONDER WOMAN - I don't know much about Wonder Woman comics. But i know that Superman comics are based on two themes. HOPE and BELIEVE IN HUMANITY. Patty Jenkins as a director took these two themes from Superman and made a Wonder Woman movie or i can say Woman Of Steel.This is basically a FISH OUT OF THE WATER storyline. The movie shows how Wonder Woman deal with the new world about which she don't know much while trying to stop World War 1. This is by far the simplest story of DCEU. Simpler then MAN OF STEEL and DAWN OF JUSTICE. M not counting Suicide Squad because i don't see much of a story in that film. But being simple is not a bad thing. In fact its great as long as origin stories goes. M glade that Themyscira the birth place of WW is given enough time to explore. Which brings me to the cinematography. From Themyscira(which has been shot in South Wales and looked gorgeous) to England to Berlin , everything looked beautiful in this movie. And the 3d is better then THE MUMMY , although i still recommend to watch it in 2d. Jokes were an integral part of the story. All of them are because of the lack of knowledge of WW about the outer world.And these jokes makes the character of WW a little bit of Naive and whole lot sweeter . Some of the jokes also goes little out of the line as long as preferability of Kids goes,I have to say i am very happy with the action sequences of the movie. True that every movie cant achieve the level of Matrix , Man Of Steel and Mad Max , but WW came pretty close. And i liked all of them. Specially the climax one. Which was too close to the climax of Dawn Of Justice , but Patty here injected some serious emotional moments of WW having the self realization , which made the action scene better. Cant go forward without talking about the scores. The whole movie has been ''VIOLINISED''. I know that not exactly a real word but i still used it. And yes the WW theme , came out 3-4 times . And its awesome. Could have been used even more. Gal Gadot is exceptional. On a level that there has been some Oscar talks running around. She well managed the Boldness and Naiveness of the character nicely. And set a benchmark in action scenes for female super heroes. Chris Pinn , called as box office poison(a star who makes flops despite good acting.) is giving here one of his best performance , and yes the movie is working very well at box office and some credit goes to him. What else to say , m happy as well as relieved to see that the movie is good. I was hoping too much from it and it paid of. 8.8/10by ANuP APu KuMaR"", ""Looking for a strong female character driven movie? Look no further. Don't hate her because she is beautiful and has super powers.Here's a summer super hero movie that delivers. There is plenty of action and just enough sensitive quiet moments. Those with a heart may even shed a tear.The movie is loaded with CGI and any other available special effects. The first battle scene on the beach sets the tone. This is about good versus evil. It's a good time at the movies and should be seen in a theater. There didn't seem to be much added seeing it in 3D. There are an abundance of night and dark scenes that need all the projection light they can get. Perhaps the 3D projection system and glasses make things a tad to dark. The strong box office will insure we will see more of Wonder Woman. Besides the most evil Germans were not those in WW I."", 'There\'s a lot that went into ""Wonder Woman""; it\'s partially a romantic comedy, coming-of-age story, period action/superhero movie, but maybe above all, a love story. Diana Prince gears up ultimately out of love - which doesn\'t sound like something that\'d fit very well in a war movie. Part of the reason this movie is so good is that it had big boots to fill. The DC movies haven\'t been stellar up to this point, and their inherent dreariness hasn\'t helped matters. And here\'s a movie with competent direction, gorgeous visuals and a lead actress that\'s fully up to the challenge. Gal Gadot instills in her character honor, innocence, and the necessary color to really bring a comic book movie to the screen.In other words, it\'s everything I was hoping for in a Wonder Woman film. It doesn\'t feel like it was ground out of a sausage factory, and really manages to do everything right. Just to give context, this is coming from a guy who\'s pretty burnt out on the genre. I loved this movie.8/10', 'It\'s a brand-new month and you know what that means right? Yes, another super hero movie to kick off the summer blockbuster season. This time it isn\'t Marvel cranking out the comic book, cinematic feature, but their rivals DC studios. With its recent shaky track record, the DC cinematic universe hasn\'t gotten the best publicity in terms of quality. So, the studio has decided to get the leading lady herself to pave the way. Yes, today\'s review is on Wonder Woman starring Gal Gadot and Chris Pine. Can this movie break the bad luck streak of DC/WB studios? Robbie K here to share some opinions on the matter, so let\'s get started, shall we?LIKES1. Gal Gadot is incredible and steals the show with her poise, pizazz, and acting talents. A fantastic casting direction that really brings the woman to wonder to life in beauty, ferocity, and bouts of heroism (a.k.a. kicking bad guy butt). Acting, stunts, and an on-point delivery of her lines makes this actress one of the tops in my book!2. The action is on point (for most of the movie) filled with impressive displays of weaponry, martial arts, and historical warfare. Wonder Woman\'s battles held such emotion, managing to bring the suspense all while delivering that feel good, post battle high, you might have gotten from reading a comic book. The team brings some fast-paced thrills we have wanted for almost a year and a half.3. A good representation for girls. I may have already said this, but this movie targets a wide variety of audience members in some form or manner. Yet this reviewer has to give props for the design of a character that is certainly worthy of representing the female super heroes and inspiring the female population that they certainly can do anything. 4. Comedic timing: It\'s not going to be a super hero movie (at least in this day and age) without some laughs to break up the tension. Wonder Woman continues this trend, filling the void with well-timed one-liners, a few awkward encounters that often deal with sex, and some slap-stick gimmicks that do the job well. 5. Character Development: I know most super hero movies have this element, but there is something about Wonder Woman that stood out to me. This film managed to spin Diana\'s character development into a roller coaster ride of feelings that almost made me tear up. Her journey to discovering herself and her role into this new world was poetically portrayed, using multiple angles to get the job done. It could have also been due to the powerful soundtrack, the visual effects, or maybe Gadot\'s acting, but it really worked for me. 6. Fast Pace: We all know those movies that drag (and yes, I\'m talking much of DC\'s library). Not the case for this film. The nearly 150-minute run time flew by for much of the movie having me at one point saying, ""Dang, it\'s already been 90 minutes."" Not something I often say. DISLIKES:1. Unoriginality: You\'ll find that Wonder Woman shares a lot with Captain America: First Avenger. The set-up, setting, and build up almost matching outside of the weapon of choice and martial arts moves. Certainly, not the biggest limitation, but something that others have been bothered by. 2. Almost pointless crew: The crew that joins Diana held such promise in the picture, but it was dropped so hard in this movie. Outside of Chris Pine, the other members do little for the overall mission outside of a few throws, some ""tracking"" and mainly comedic relief. There were hints at character development and deeper dynamics, but they fizzled out faster than sparkler at 4th of July. I know, this movie is about Wonder Woman, but why even include these guys if that was the goal. 3. Preachy: Some reviews state the whole feminism/males are pigs is overdone, and to an extent I agree. Yet the bigger dislike was the preachy monologues that sometimes plagued this film. A few times the heat of the moment was lost in a display of self-reflection, which is great, but not in the midst of a battlefield. Some of these moments also had that eye-rolling factor for me. 4. Overuse of CGI: I like special effects, I like stunts, but I don\'t like overuse of a gimmick. The slow-motion interludes during the action scenes added some cool emphasis to Wonder Woman\'s skills (alongside some cool finishing moves). Somewhere along the production, someone got a little trigger happy with the effect and used a little too much for me, and soon started disrupting the cool stunts they had Gal do. In addition, there were some special effects that were a bit cheesy and took the edge off of Wonder Woman. Learn from Michael Bay people, too much of special effects makes for many jokes. 5. The ending: Don\'t turn away, hear me out. The ending is great on many levels (emotional, prowess, role model, and morals). However, it lost the momentum the first few fights had with them, trading suspense for flashy special effects, drawn out banter, and unimpressive choreography. Sort of felt like the ending to X-men apocalypse where the bad guys bark was worse than his bite. The VERDICT:Wonder Woman delivers on many levels and breaks the mediocre displays that DC has cranked out over the last year. It\'s emotional, it\'s dynamic, it\'s fun, and it provides a solid role model for admirable heroes. I feel the movie met most of my expectations and I was happy with the overall product. It\'s far from perfect though, and still has a few things to tighten up (like developing other characters, balancing the CGI use, and keeping the momentum going). Still, I have to recommend this one for a theater visit, especially you comic lovers out there.', ""Why choose the first world war? This is your typical super hero film, there is not a lot of great cinematography and typical interchangeable music score. There's no in-depth characters too. The action scenes were limited because it is the world war. Definitely a boring watch."", ""Gal is not right in this. The story is so contrived that my suspension of disbelief never got an inch off the ground. And neither did the plot.

A van from Wayne Enterprises delivers a briefcase from Bruce Wayne, which contains an old photograph of Diana alongside four men during World War I. A note from Bruce says he would like to hear the story behind the picture.Decades in the past, when she was a child, Diana (played by Lilly Aspell) grew up on the island of Themyscira. The mighty Amazons, an all-female warrior clan, lived there secretly and secluded. She watches the warriors training on the field under General Antiope (Robin Wright). Diana wants to be a fighter like the rest of the Amazons, but her mother, Queen Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen) forbids her daughter from training.Hippolyta tells Diana that Zeus made the humans with a good nature. However, Ares, the god of war, corrupted them. Humans were filled with suspicion and jealousy. They were constantly at war. The other gods tried to stop Ares, but he killed them one by one. Zeus also struggled until, with his last strength, he hit Ares so hard that ""he was forced to retreat"". Later, Zeus forged a weapon that can destroy Ares. With Zeus\'s dying breath he created the secluded home for the Amazons named Themyscira, with an enchanted barrier to hide them from the rest of the world. Diana wants to see the great weapon so later, Hippolyta shows Diana the powerful sword known as the God Killer. She explains that it can kill the god Ares, but Hippolyta hopes that there will never be a need to wield it.Antiope convinces Hippolyta to let her train Diana, wanting her to be ready to face Ares, because they all know he\'s still out there. Hippolyta reluctantly agrees. Through the years, Antiope subjects Diana to harsh and intense training in the field. As she reaches adulthood, Diana continues training to be as fierce as the other Amazons. During one session, Antiope pushes Diana hard with her swordplay, leading Diana to defend herself by deflecting the sword with her gauntlets. This causes Antiope to fly back and hurt herself. Diana shows great remorse for hurting Antiope. She leaves in shame, but Antiope is far from upset.Diana runs over to a cliff. In the distance, a plane passes through the barrier into Themyscira before crashing into the ocean. Diana dives into the water and swims toward the plane. A pilot named Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) is sinking as he cannot break himself free from his seat. Diana pulls him out of the plane and takes him to shore. As she becomes surprised to see a man for the first time, German soldiers following Steve make it past the barrier as well. The Amazons arrive as they find Diana with Steve, but also see the Germans. The Amazons ready their arrows, and the Germans aim their rifles. The arrows are launched and shots are fired. The Germans make it to the shore and battle the Amazons. Several Amazons are shot dead while the Germans get taken out easily. Antiope fires three arrows at once to kill three soldiers. One soldier aims his gun at Diana, and Antiope leaps in to take the shot. Diana rushes to Antiope\'s side. As she dies, she tells Diana it is her time to wield the God Killer.Steve is interrogated before all the Amazons with the Lasso of Truth. He is forced to confess that he is a spy with the Allied forces. Steve explains to the Amazons about World War I and how he has learned of a sinister plan by Germany\'s General Erich Ludendorff (Danny Huston) and his chief chemist Dr. Isabel Maru, AKA Dr. Poison (Elena Anaya). They are concocting a new bio-weapon, which Steve claims is unlike anything he\'s seen before and tells the Amazons they are in more danger than they realize. Steve acted as a spy in the German army before stealing Maru\'s notebook and flying away with it as he destroyed the Germans\' other planes until they followed him to the island. Diana realizes this must be the work of Ares.Steve is allowed to bathe in the Amazons\' fountain to replenish himself. Diana walks in and accidentally sees him nude. She asks what ""that"" is, and Steve says it is his father\'s watch, which he says he follows to let him know what to do in the day. Diana is confused by the device and its uses.Still fearing that Ares is behind the ongoing war, Diana grabs her shield, lasso, and then takes the God Killer sword from its holding, along with her battle suit. She goes to tell Steve she will help him get home if he takes her to Ares. The two head for the shore but are approached by Hippolyta and other Amazons. Diana is insistent that she goes out there to stop Ares and end the war. Hippolya tearfully embraces her daughter one last time and tells her she has always been her greatest love, but today she is her greatest sorrow. She gives Diana Antiope\'s tiara as a parting gift, but warns her that if she leaves she may not be able to return to Themyscira. As Diana and Steve depart, Hippolyta confides to an Amazon that Diana can\'t know what she really is, or else Ares will find her faster.Diana and Steve arrive in London. The two meet with Steve\'s secretary, Etta Candy (Lucy Davis). Before they can deliver Maru\'s notebook to Steve\'s superiors, they find Diana an appropriate outfit to wear so she can blend in for the time. Diana and Steve are then cornered by some men in an alley. They draw their guns, but Diana beats them all down, even letting Steve punch the last guy out.Ludendorff meets with Maru in her lab. She has developed a new type of gas for the general so that he may maintain his super strength. Maru then comes across a formula on her table, which she thinks is the breakthrough they\'ve been looking for.Diana and Steve head on over to a meeting held by Sir Patrick Morgan (David Thewlis), who is planning to negotiate an armistice with Germany. The men in the room are immediately distracted by Diana\'s presence. Steve is forced to take her outside. Later, he presents Sir Patrick with the notebook. Since the writing is in Sumerian, Steve has Diana (who speaks hundreds of languages) translate it for the other men. They learn that Ludendorff and Maru are planning to create a new kind of hydrogen-based mustard gas that would be far more lethal to the soldiers. After hearing that the British general is planning to send his troops to the Western Front and go in to most likely get killed, Diana becomes enraged and tells the general that a good leader would fight alongside his men. Steve pulls Diana out again as she tells him that she believes Ludendorff is Ares in disguise. Steve confides to Diana that he will personally take her to the Front.Steve brings Diana to meet his teammates. They first stop at a pub and find Sameer (Said Taghmaoui), a spy who is instantly attracted to Diana. Next is Charlie (Ewen Bremner), whom Steve says is a skilled marksman, but they find him getting beaten up by another man for accidentally taking his glass. The man attempts to shoot Charlie, but Diana intervenes and knocks the man down. The four then head out to meet The Chief (Eugene Brave Rock), a smuggler.Ludendorff meets with some of his comrades to discuss what he has planned. After they express some doubts and lack of confidence in his work, Ludendorff and Maru demonstrate their work by throwing the gas bomb in the room, killing all the men.The team makes it to the Front. They walk through the trenches, and Diana speaks to a local woman who is distraught over what has been taken from them by the German army. Not wanting to wait any longer, Diana dons her tiara and steps out into the battlefield with her armor. The German soldiers begin to fire upon her, but she easily deflects their bullets with her gauntlets. Diana proceeds to beat down the enemy soldiers while Steve and his team follow. Once she takes out most of the soldiers on the ground, the men help Diana leap to a sniper tower, which she instantly demolishes. The townspeople celebrate and cheer for Diana.Steve later learns that Ludendorff will be attending a gala the next day. He has Etta locate the area for him, but Sir Patrick urges Steve not to go ahead and do it. Steve naturally ignores him. He then tells Diana about the gala and how she would be unprepared for it, so he shows her how to dance. They go up to a room to be alone, and they share a kiss.The team heads over to the gala in disguise. Steve pretends to be a German officer with Sameer being his driver as they improvise entering without an invitation. Diana finds a snooty woman and steals her dress. Steve attempts to sweet-talk Maru to get more information, but he becomes distracted when he sees Diana enter in the blue dress. Diana sees Ludendorff and gets ready to kill him, but Steve stops her from messing up the plan. However, Ludendorff proceeds to launch gas bombs into the nearby town. Diana runs ahead but is too late. She sees the townspeople dead in the streets and can only look on with despair. Steve runs by and Diana is angry with him for not letting her kill Ludendorff before this happened.It is learned that Ludendorff plans to use a plane to drop a number of gas bombs down on London. Diana rushes to an airbase where the German soldiers are gearing up for their attack. Diana beats down some soldiers before making her way to Ludendorff. He inhales Maru\'s strength gas and fights Diana. Ludendorff puts up a good fight until he runs to the roof. Diana bursts through and impales Ludendorff with the God Killer. He dies but Diana sees that the soldiers are still pushing the gas bombs into the plane.Steve shows up and Diana is confused as to why the war isn\'t over if she killed Ares. Steve says that maybe the war isn\'t a result of a god but rather that there are just bad people out there. He leaves, and Diana looks back inside Ludendorff\'s office to see Sir Patrick. Diana realizes it is him that is really Ares. He tells Diana how he only provided secret influence to people like Ludendorff and Maru to get their work going, but it was their own evil, as well as the darkness of other men, that led to the war. Diana tries to kill Ares with the sword, only for him to destroy it. He tells Diana that it is she who is the real weapon forged by Zeus. She is the real God Killer. Using the Lasso, Ares shows Diana what can happen if she joins him and if they rid the world of mankind. She refuses, and they begin to fight.Steve and his team get past the Germans. They consider shooting the plane down, but the explosion would kill anyone within 50 Miles. As Diana and Ares\' fight extends onto the tarmac, Steve runs by Diana, says something quick, and he gives her his father\'s watch. He hijacks the bomber plane and flies it away. As he gets high enough, Steve aims his gun at the bombs. He takes a moment to consider what he\'s doing, but he knows what he has to do. He shoots the bombs, sacrificing himself as the plane blows up. Diana sees this and yells in agony. Ares only uses this to try and sway her even more to join him as he dons his armor. Ares brings Maru before Diana and removes Maru\'s mask to reveal her disfigured face. He tries to convince Diana to kill her. Diana lifts up a tank, but she recalls what Steve just told her. He said he can save the day, but she can save the world. He told her he loved her before taking the plane. Diana drops the tank and lets Maru get away. Diana tells Ares that she believes in love. Ares fires a blast of energy at Diana, but she absorbs it with her gauntlets and directs it back toward Ares, destroying him for good. The soldiers are then broken free of their corruption.Everyone celebrates the end of the war. Diana sees a wall of the fallen heroes, including Steve.Back in the present, Diana sends a message to Bruce Wayne, thanking him for the photograph and letting her keep a piece of Steve. Her voice-over then reassures that she will continue dedicating her life to justice. With that, Diana leaps across the sky to continue her work as...WONDER WOMAN.']"
17,DC Extended Universe,Justice League,974015,"[""Having been underwhelmed by the waste of great potential that was 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' (not terrible but rather lacklustre) and seeing that critical reception was not particularly good, expectations for 'Justice League' were not very high.Although it has major problems, 'Justice League' turned out to be better than expected. Contrary to the constant critic bashing, which to be perfectly honest has gotten out of control and extremely annoying fast for a while now, critics get a good deal of respect from me. Even when my opinions differ to theirs, which has happened a fair number of times, their appraisals and criticisms are very understandable and it is easy to see where they are coming from. 'Justice League' is a case of the film being much better than anticipated, considering the word of mouth and 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' being so disappointing. Is 'Justice League' better than that film? Yes, by quite a bit.'Justice League' does have its problems. Although the CGI is pretty good on the whole, there is an over-reliance of it and it doesn't always add to some of the scenes. The story has its fun and excitingly compelling moments, but a lot of it does feel rushed, which does see too many abrupt tonal and storytelling shifts, and some of the first half has a cobbled together and rambling quality. Am usually not one to carp about plot holes, much of the time it is a lazy criticism to me, but one can fit the Grand Canyon through some of them and some border on the ridiculous.The rushed pacing does come at the expense of character development, which tends to be rather flimsy. Particularly true to this is the villain, there is nothing menacing or remotely interesting about him, he's basically a very dull just there sort of character. Ciaran Hinds is completely wasted, while Ray Fisher is somewhat dull. Not all the jokes work, some feel out of place, while the final battle could have had more excitement and Danny Elfman's music score is uninspired and forgettable.On the other hand, most of the acting is very good. Ben Affleck brings a brooding intensity to Batman and he didn't seem that bored to me. Other bright spots in the cast are Jeremy Irons' very amusing Alfred, Amy Adams' feisty if somewhat underused Lois Lane, Jason Momoa's beautifully judged Aquaman and particularly Gal Gadot's positively show-stopping Wonder Woman. Ezra Miller is amusing, if at times slightly too introverted, as Flash and Henry Cavill looks much more comfortable here than he did in 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice'. Diane Lane and JK Simmons are also welcome presences.Visually, 'Justice League' is beautifully shot, far more cohesively edited and its boldly dark and gritty look fits very well within the story. The script is less clunky and dreary and lightened by some nice quirky humour and some jokes are amusing, especially the absolute hoot that involves the magic lasso. The action is mostly nicely choreographed and fun to watch, some of the characters are interesting and the chemistry is great.In summary, could have been much better but to me it wasn't that bad. 5.5-6/10 Bethany Cox"", ""JUSTICE LEAGUE is another epic-wannabe superhero flick, this time from DC Comics rather than Marvel. BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE was slated somewhat so this is different, more action-packed and much briefer in scope, represented by a running time that comes in just under two hours. Not only to Batman and Superman return, but they're now joined by fresh newcomers like Wonder Woman, the Flash and Aquaman. Generally it's a light and breezy affair, heavy on the inevitable CGI set-piece sequences, but with snappier and more humorous dialogue than before. I did find the main villain a little weak, a typical CGI baddie much like Sauron in THE LORD OF THE RINGS, and they manipulate Ciaran Hinds' voice so much you can barely tell it's him. Otherwise this is a light, popcorn-style movie, enjoyable as a one-off watch."", 'Justice League (2017)*** (out of 4)After the death of Superman (Henry Cavill), Batman (Ben Affleck) decides to get a superteam together because a strong enemy could be trying to end the world. With the help of Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), The Flash (Ezra Miller), Aquaman (Jason Momoa) and Cyborg (Ray Fisher) the Justice League goes out to defeat Steppenwolf but a moral question regarding Superman creeps up.It seems that in today\'s comic book movie world one must constantly compare the two rivals. That of course being DC and Marvel but I think we\'re at the point where that just needs to stop. Sure, fans have their favorites but comparing the two is just rather pointless to me but then again I\'m not really a comic book fan. With that said, I\'m also not a huge fan of Zack Snyder but I must say that I found JUSTICE LEAGUE to be an entertaining movie. Even though it falls well short of being a classic or even one of the better comic book movies out there.I think the best part of the film is the fact that the superheroes themselves are so good and entertaining. It does seem that Batman\'s role in the film was taken down a bit and this might be due to how successful WONDER WOMAN was at the box office. She\'s certainly front and center here and there\'s no question that\'s not a bad thing. I also thought the addition of Aquaman was great as Momoa was excellent in the role and it was great whenever he was on the screen. I also thought The Flash was put to a good start here, although it seems they were taking the more ""dork"" approach like Spider-Man was in the AVENGERS movie. I wasn\'t the biggest fan of Cyborg here as he was the least interesting of all the heroes.Snyder\'s direction was actually quite good here but I guess there\'s some controversy over him walking away from the project and it being finished by Joss Whedeon. I don\'t know all the details of who shot what or who made what decisions but I thought the flow of the movie was quite good. I also thought the CGI world was good for what it was and especially the battle scene at the end, which was a lot of fun. The performances were good by the entire cast as there\'s no question that everyone is fitting into their roles nicely. I\'m still not sure what\'s up with the voice of Batman but that\'s another topic.JUSTICE LEAGUE, as I said, has some flaws including it getting off to a rather slow start. I\'d also argue that the film could have used a tad bit more excitement but at the same time I think it delivered enough to where fans should be entertained.', ""Superman (Henry Cavill) is dead. Batman (Ben Affleck) encounters a winged alien and evidences of three powerful boxes. Fearing a coming alien apocalypse, he gathers a group of superheroes with ally Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot). They recruit The Flash (Ezra Miller), Aquaman (Jason Momoa), and Cyborg (Ray Fisher) forming the Justice League.I know most of the complaints being leveled against this movie. What surprised me is that the movie kinda bored me. I have lots of nitpicks but overall, the simplistic ragged storytelling leaves me wanting. The first thing I notice is the inferior CGI. Some of it looks more like a video game. I know about the unmustaching but it's not obvious on a smaller TV. Something is fake about his face but there is a lot that looks fake in this movie. The storytelling is jumpy and doesn't really flow. The villain is one dimensional at best and lacks any compelling characteristics. As for the JL members, they are generally good with the most glaring problem coming from Batman himself. For some reason, he has turned quippy which doesn't fit this version of Batman. Flash is a lonely nerd somewhere on the spectrum. I don't mind that but they don't expand on it. Wonder Woman is wonderful and she has some of the better emotional moments with the other members. Cyborg is a fine addition. Aquaman is a great character but his story probably has some stuff cut from the movie. Hopefully, his movie will expand on that. I do like this more than BvS. It has many problems but at least, it's a not mess like that one."", ""This movie demonstrates that the people in charge of the DC Universe have been learning the lessons of what they have been doing wrong and what Marvel has been doing right, in a mechanical fashion, if nothing else. The right things include hiring Joss Whedon to work over matters, because not everyone spends every second of every day being a miserable meanie, and that different things motivate different people. Some of the things they have learned that are wrong include 1: a dorky, brilliant teenager makes a great character, so let's make the Flash Spiderman; 2: the relationship between Paranoid Batman and everyone else doesn't work, so let's just.... gloss that over awkwardly, by having him behave awkwardly over it.That's fine, because these are all people who do not Play Well with Others. On the plus side, one thing DC figured out was how to deal with the Rock-em-Sock-em Robots battle, by putting in grades of robots, and noticing that there are actually civilians on the battlefield, and assigning some people to actually getting them out of the way of the FREAKING HOLOCAUST THAT'S APPEARING RIGHT AROUND THEM! On the other hand, the second third of the movie turns into Waiting for Superman, since once the Man of Steel shows up, neither G*d nor wombat can stand against his might.Mind you, I stopped reading comic books in 1969, and hadn't bothered with DC for half a decade before then. Still, it was more amusing and a better story than BATMAN VS SUPERMAN. They're still pinning their hopes on Gal Gadot, though."", ""There used to be debate 25 years ago. Why did DC have more success with their movies than Marvel.The main hooks for DC were Superman and Batman. Although Warner Brothers tended to be careless with some of the the sequels.Nowadays it is not even an argument. Marvel wins hands down. Even a secondary character such as Black Panther knocked bells out of Justice League at the box office.With Superman dead, Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) senses a brooding darkness on the horizon and he wants to assemble a team of people with special powers.Batman already has Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot.) He and Alfred seek out the quick as lightning Flash (Ezra Miller) Aquaman (Jason Momoa) and the Cyborg, Victor Stone (Ray Fisher.) After some bickering they become part of the Justice League.They do battle with the alien Steppenwolf who is looking to reclaim three hidden mother boxes that will give him untold powers.One of the boxes is in the human world and Cyborg calculates that the power in the box could re-awaken Superman.In Justice League, you would had expected a film with six superheroes would be more exhilarating. The problem might be that the finished movie is a compromise of two directors work.Joss Whedon who was brought in to finish the film, instead decided to do a lot of reshoots. Then Whedon had to cut down the running time. Deleting scenes and some scenes looked rushed.The film lacks the fun factor. Steppenwolf joins a long line of dull CGI villains.Both Victor Stone and Aquaman were flat with only Flash having a spark.When it came to the fight scenes everyone is flying around. I heard one critic remark, they were really falling with style as in the original Toy Story.At least the film brings back a bit of the John Williams Superman theme as well as Michael Keaton's Batman theme."", 'When the evil and powerful Steppenwolf returns to Earth with his demons after the death of Superman, he retrieves the Mother Box from The Paradise Island. Queen Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen) warns her daughter Diana Prince (Gal Gadot) about the menace to the planet and the Wonder Woman meets Batman (Ben Affleck) to discuss how defend Earth. Meanwhile Steppenwolf retrieves the second Mother Box from Atlantis and Batman and Wonder Woman team up with The Flash (Ezra Miller), Aquaman (Jason Momoa) and Cyborg (Ray Fisher), with the support of Alfred (Jeremy Irons), to protect the last Mother Box entrusted to humans. But Batman concludes that they do not have enough power to save the world and proposes to use the power of the Box to revive Superman (Henry Cavill) despite the risks. Will his plan work?""Justice League"" is an entertaining adventure with superheroes from our childhood protecting Earth from destruction. The excess of CGI can be understood and gives the sensation of a cartoon on the screen with great action scenes. Gal Gadot steals the show with her magnificent Wonder Woman. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Liga da Justiça"" (""Justice League"")', 'Plot spoilers of a predictable plot.The film picks off after the last one left off...the one where Superman died and not the Suicide Squad thing. It seems when Superman died, this opened things up for aliens to come take over the Earth such as Steppenwolf, who was here before and was defeated aka LOTR style as races united to fight a common evil. Each was given a box to guard because a ring was already done. The boxes are part of a device that was designed to reform the Earth, almost like the Genesis Project in Star Trek that brought Spock. In fact I knew they would bring back Superman the moment they killed him as did most of us. Flash (Ezra Miller) was a refreshing character bringing some humor to the film reminding me of Spiderman in that other superhero series. I think the film would have been better if the Superman casket had been empty.I have my standard criticisms: the fight scenes were too long and the plot was too predictable. Sound track and effects were good. What happened to the Clooney Batman again? I have a ""Homer Simpson"" view of this League. If you have Superman, why do you need the rest? I think the series would have been better with Superman dead. Especially with Henry Cavill being the most boring Superman to date. Call me a male pig, but I liked Wonder Woman with cleavage. Did I say I liked Flash? I thought the new Thor film was better written and performed.', ""I've been getting into the Super Hero movies, I've loved those I've watched, but this one just didn't work for me. If I'm being brutal I found it a bit dull, it feels like a tick box exercise, so much effort to get all of these big character and huge stars in, that they forgot to concentrate on adding a story.Was this made to be a good piece of cinema, or was it made as a fan boy pleasing fan fair? Whatever the scenario, it's not great.The one saving grace, Affleck, he does his best.Woeful, 3/10."", ""If you overthink things, than you will not have any fun with this movie. Not at all and that is because there are quite a few flaws, that are nicely hidden, if you just go in and shut off your brain. And I don't mean that in a bad way, because if you do that, you will be able to be entertained by this movie. So new characters (quite a few, if you don't count an after credits scene in a previous movie) are being introduced here.And I get it that many people who care don't like how things are being rushed. It's almost like DC feels they have to push fast forward, to keep up with Marvel or reach the level the other universe is in right now. Which does not work in their favor mostly. On the other hand, the movie was quite succesful and it didn't matter that many things didn't make much sense. Light humor and everything included ..."", 'I waited to catch this movie on DVD because I\'m kind of tired being disappointed by DC super-hero films in the theater. If one considers this story as a sequel to \'Dawn of Justice\', then it works well enough to bring Superman (Henry Cavill) back from the dead, but that\'s about it. The plot is oh, so familiar, in that we have three missing \'mother boxes\' that need to be reunited to form the \'Unity\', an apocalyptic power that can destroy worlds and transform them into primordial hell-scapes. How many times have we been exposed to that kind of scenario? The master villain this time is a character with the not so original name of Steppenwolf, and for folks like myself who\'ve been around a while, that only brings back memories of a Magic Carpet Ride. This might actually be the most comic-bookish movie I\'ve yet seen, as most of the action sequences looked like the panels of a comic strip. Most notable as an example would be any of those featuring Barry Allen\'s Flash whenever he got up to warp speed. Speaking of which, I thought Ezra Miller was too young to be portraying a DC hero along side such stalwarts as Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman. These were my Silver Age icons back in the Fifties and early Sixties, so I couldn\'t relate to his character here as part of the Justice League. Jason Momoa brought an unexpected regal bearing to the person of Aquaman/Arthur Curry, while Cyborg (Ray Fisher) I couldn\'t relate to at any level as he wasn\'t part of my comic book past. So my biggest question about establishing this first installment of the super hero club was \'Where\'s Green Lantern\'? I thought that was a big mistake and a major unforced error.But of course, the finale sets us up for the sequel with Batman (Ben Affleck), or I should say, Bruce Wayne, using his wealth to buy a huge building for the Justice League headquarters. There was a hint of new members, so it would have been cool if the after-credits scenes offered a glimpse of additional super-heroes, but the most we got was the tease of a Superman/Flash race and a potential team up between Luthor and Deathstroke. What I\'d really like to see in future DC based stories is some of the humor that the Marvel folks manage to incorporate into their pictures, most notably the recent ""Thor: Ragnarok"". I think the DC heroes would be better served by not having the writers take things so seriously.', ""The Marvel Universe is brilliantly successful, but the DC Extended Universe has been a mixed bag; Man of Steel was good, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice was crap, Suicide Squad was alright, and Wonder Woman was fantastic, so expectations were high for this movie, bringing all the DC Comics heroes together, directed by Zack Snyder (300, Watchmen, Sucker Punch). Basically thousands of years ago, Steppenwolf (Ciarán Hinds) and his army of Parademons attempted to conquer the world using the power of the three Mother Boxes, but they were defeated by a unified army of the Olympian Gods, Amazons, Atlanteans, humans, and Green Lanterns, following this the Mother Boxes were separated and hidden in locations around Earth. In the present, the world is mourning the death of Superman (Henry Cavill), this has triggered the Mother Boxes to reactivate and Steppenwolf's return to Earth in an effort to regain favour with his master, Darkseid. Steppenwolf manages to retrieve the Mother Box from Themyscira, Queen Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen) warns her daughter Diana Prince aka Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) of Steppenwolf'd by lighting the invasion fire. Meanwhile Bruce Wayne aka Batman (Ben Affleck) knows the world is under threat from an oncoming evil, he is attempting to unite other metahumans to a cause to stop it. Wayne goes after Arthur Curry aka Aquaman (Game of Thrones' Jason Momoa), who has superhuman strength, speed and aquatic capabilities, and Barry Allen aka The Flash (We Need to Talk About Kevin's Ezra Miller), who has immense superhuman speed and time and space manipulation capabilities. Prince looks for Victor Stone aka Cyborg (Ray Fisher), who has mechanical parts, giving him superhuman strength, electronic capabilities and flight. Stone joins when his father Silas (Joe Morton) is kidnapped, along with S.T.A.R. Labs (Scientific and Technological Advanced Research Labs) employees, by Steppenwolf looking for the Mother Boxes. Curry takes action and joins the cause, when Steppenwolf attacks Atlantis to retrieve the next Mother Box. Commissioner James Gordon (J.K. Simmons) tells the team the Steppenwolf's Army are based in an abandoned facility under Gotham Harbor, they are able to rescue the kidnapped employees, but the facility is flooded during the combat, the team escape when Curry delays the flood. Stone retrieves the last Mother Box, it was hidden from the group for analysis, Stone reveals that his father used the Mother Box to rebuild Stone's body after a life-threatening accident. Wayne decides that the Mother Box should be used to resurrect Superman, both to help defeat Steppenholf, and to restore hope to mankind, Prince and Curry are hesitant about the idea, but Wayne has a secret contingency plan in case Superman returns as a nemesis. Clark Kent's body is exhumed from his grave, he is placed in the waters of the Kryptonian ship alongside the Mother Box, it is successfully activated and Superman is resurrected, however his memories have not returned, he attacks the group after stone accidentally fires a projectile at him. On the verge of being killed, Batman enacts his contingency plan: Lois Lane (Amy Adams), Superman calms down seeing her, he leaves with her and returns to his family home in Smallville, there he recovers and tries to recover his memories. The final Mother Box is unguarded, allowing Steppenwolf to easily retrieve it, the five heroes, unaided by Superman, travel to a village in Russia where Steppenwolf plans to unite the boxes together and reshape the world. The team fights their way through the Parademons to reach Steppenwolf, but they are unable to distract him long enough for Stone to separate the boxes. Superman arrives, he aids Allen with the evacuation of the citizens, then assists Stone in the separation of the Mother Boxes, Steppenwolf is defeated by the group, as he is overcome with fear, and attacked by his own Parademons, before they are all teleported away. In the aftermath of the battle, Wayne and Prince agree to rebuild Wayne Manor as an operations base for the team, with additional space for more heroes; Prince steps out in public as a hero; Allen gets a job in Central City's police department, impressing his father Henry (Billy Crudup), serving time in prison; Stone continues to explore and enhance his abilities with his father; Curry returns to Atlantis; and Superman returns to the Daily Planet as Clark Kent. In the post-credits, Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg) has escaped from Arkham Asylum and recruits Slade Wilson aka Deathstroke (Joe Manganiello) to form their own league. Also starring Jeremy Irons as Alfred, Amber Heard as Mera, Robin Wright as Antiope, Diane Lane as Martha Kent, Ingvar Eggert Sigurðsson as Mayor and Sergi Constance as Zeus. Affleck is better this time as the Dark Knight, Cavill makes a fairly welcome return as the Man of Steel, Gadot still kicks ass as the main heroine, and the other superhero recruits do their parts as well. To be honest, it is not the most original story, it is a very simple plot, villain wants to destroy and reform the Earth, the heroes band together and have to stop him, pretty simple, but at least the fight sequences and special effects are nothing to complain about, a predictable but alright superhero action movie. Worth watching!"", 'I had absolutely no expectations to this movie, as it is a superhero movie after all. And I am by no means much fan of superheroes. But it turned out that ""Justice League"" was actually rather enjoyable and entertaining.Sure, don\'t expect to be intellectually challenged by anything this movie has to offer, just lean back and watch the action and the amazing special effects. The action sequences were good and kept the flow of the movie at a good pace.The villain felt somewhat as not utilized enough, especially since the plan to kill off the entire planet was so easily thwarted, and who hadn\'t seen that coming a mile away?It was The Flash who carried the torch in this movie because he was hilarious and really stole the light. Aquaman and Wonder Woman felt like as if they were not given enough screen time, and they could easily have contributed with so much more. Batman, well, he was as Batman always is, so no surprise there. Superman definitely didn\'t have a big enough role in the movie, and with good reason. Cyborg felt very shallow, as he had little impact on the movie, but then again not really a character I have much personal interest in.""Justice League"" had a rather impressive ensemble of actors and actresses on the cast list to portray the various characters. And that definitely helped the movie along nicely.""Justice League"" has great visual effects, which really help elevate the movie to a more enjoyable level.This is one of the more fun superhero movies to watch, and that is not something I say lightly because I am very much not a fan of the superhero genre.', 'I watched this at home on BluRay from our public library. My wife skipped, not her type of movie.In essence this is a continuation of the ""Batman vs Superman"" movie, in this story a mythical character Steppenwolf has returned with a plan to destroy the whole world, perhaps the whole universe. As he gains more power the six remaining members of the Justice League are trying hard but seem to be fighting a losing battle. They really need Superman but can they figure out a way to re-animate him? To bring him back alive?Well as we know anything is possible in the comics. And now we know the world is still here, so there\'s that. As a long-time superhero fan I found the movie a bit uneven but still enjoyable. As much as the movie, I enjoyed the approximately 14 minute BD extra that explains the history of the Justice League and its characters in the comics, and some of the changes over the years. Plus the picture and sound are first-rate, my powered subwoofer really got a workout!', ""Last year, I compared the Marvel movie-Captain America: Civil War-with the DC one-Superman vs. Batman: Dawn of Justice-and I considered the Marvel one better. This time having previously watched the Marvel one-Thor: Ragnarok-and then the DC one-this one-I'm considering the DC one better mainly based on more action and possibly also more heroes. Besides Batman and Wonder Woman, there are also Cyborg, Aquaman, and The Flash (By the way, I can't help thinking he's being written and played in the form of the Spider-Man character in the recent Marvel movies: that of a teen/young adult in over his head but with great enthusiasm) . Oh, and one more but that may be considered a spoiler. Oh, wait, I put the warning in my review so here it is: Superman comes back to life! Anyway, this was quite an awesome ride that I just watched with my movie theatre working-friend who had watched before and was also enamored with it enough to agree with me of it being better than the Thor one. So that's a high recommendation for Justice League. P.S. I noticed that besides Ben Affleck (Batman) who previously played Daredevil, another player who previously appeared in a Marvel movie was J. K. Simmons (Commissioner Jim Gordon here) who was J. Jonah Jameson in the first three Spider-Man movies that starred Tobey Maguire. Oh, and Marc McClure-who was Jimmy Olsen in the Christopher Reeve Superman movies-has a cameo as a jail guard."", ""This film tells the story of Batman and Wonder Woman putting a team together to fight against evil forces who try to bring the fragments of the mother box back together.The visual effects are very impressive, and the story is very fast paced. In fact, it is so fast that it sacrifices the story telling. The main backbone of the story is there, but there's no cohesion, engagement and no captivation. The plethora of characters also mean that each of them get little screen time, hence there's little developer of characters. I thought I was just being fed some fragmented scenes. The socially awkward young guy tries too hard to provide comedic relief, that it makes the heroic efforts of the league less credible. Unfortunately I did not enjoy this film as much as I thought I would."", 'Zack Snyder directs this gathering of the many DC Comics superheroes working together as the Justice League protecting the nation and the world from a powerful evil enemy. These fighters for good band together before Gotham City and the world buckle under from an ultimate threat.Story line could use some help in being more realistic and any character developing is quite lax. But there is the WOW factor of having Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Flash and Superman sharing the screen fighting evil and correcting natural disasters. The villains could be considered ""ho-hum"" by some, but it is the Justice League fighting together to make up for any disappointments.The action is held together with background music from the likes of Hans Zimmer, the White Stripes, John Williams and Danny Elfman. A crowded cast features: Ben Affleck, Gal Gadot, Ezra Miller, Amy Adams, Jason Momoa, Henry Cavill, J.K. Silmmons and Jeremy Irons. Some may find it easier to be critical than complimentary. But JUSTICE LEAGUE is what it is. Enjoy!', 'Batman (Ben Affleck) gathers together Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), the Flash (Ezra Miller), Aquaman (Jason Momoa) and Cyborg (Ray Fisher) to battle Steppenwolf (CGI). He\'s a being from Darkseid to get three boxes on Earth to get total control.Quick (only 2 hours), fast and basically lots of fun. After the disaster that was ""Batman vs. Superman"" I expected the worst but was pleasantly surprised. There\'s plenty of action and carton-like violence but no blood or gore. The plot is easy to understand and there\'s welcome doses of humor. There\'s also great acting by Affleck and Gadot. However there are minuses. Fisher is blank as Cyborg. Miller is neither cute nor charming--just annoying. Also turning Aquaman into a bad-ass was a spectacularly stupid idea. Also Amy Adams (as Lois Lane) and Diane Lane (as Ma Kent) were woefully underused. Still I loved the movie. Also, as always, wait for a cool little sequence after the closing credits.', '""Justice League"" is a slam-bang, smash-up saga, but it doesn\'t surpass last year\'s ""Batman Vs Superman: Dawn of Justice."" Mind you, as entertaining as ""Justice League"" is, it isn\'t as exhilarating as Marvel\'s most recent ""Thor: Ragnarok."" At this point, the cliché about apples and oranges crop up. The DC Cinematic Universe differs from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Nevertheless, despite their intrinsic differences, comparisons are inevitable. I grew up reading DC Comics and preferred them over Marvel Comics. Unfortunately, Warner Brothers hasn\'t scored the same critical and commercial success that New Line Cinema, Columbia Pictures, Paramount Pictures, Twentieth Century Fox, and Walt Disney have with the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Ironically, Warner Brothers made history when it released the first ""Batman"" (1989) with Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson, but the esteemed studio—Warner Brothers introduced sound movies--hasn\'t maintained the consistency and charisma that distinguishes the Marvel Cinematic Universe.For the record, the first Marvel property to illuminate the silver screen was ""Captain America"" (1944), but it was a 15-chapter, black & white, Saturday afternoon, Republic Studios serial. DC Comics still beat its competitor to the screen with Columbia\'s release of the 15-chapter ""Batman"" serial in 1943 and followed it up with a 1949 serial sequel. Later, these serials inspired Twentieth Century Fox\'s live-action ""Batman"" television series, co-starring Adam West & Burt Ward, that aired from 1966 to 1968. Initially, the Marvel Cinematic Universe stumbled at the get-go with ""Howard the Duck"" (1986) as well as the straight-to-video versions of ""The Punisher"" (1989) and ""Captain America"" (1990). New Line Cinema\'s ""Blade"" (1998), Twentieth Century Fox\'s ""X-Men"" (2000), and Columbia\'s ""Spider-Man"" (2000) struck pay-dirt on the big-screen. Disney has since appropriated the MCU from Paramount Pictures, and they have made it a cornerstone of their studio. Ultimately, the DC Cinematic Universe doesn\'t have anybody like Stan Lee, the venerable Marvel Comics\' publisher and chairman who everybody recognizes and adores with his cameo appearance. Moreover, Warner\'s has not been able to duplicate its stunning back-to-back success with ""Batman V Superman"" and ""Wonder Woman."" The biggest problems facing ""Justice League"" are its $300-million price tag and its $150-million advertising campaign. Meaning, just because ""Justice League"" is a good movie, doesn\'t mean that it will triple its investment like ""Batman V Superman"" and ""Wonder Woman."" ""Suicide Squad"" was no slouch either with worldwide receipts amounting to over $745-million.Meantime, any movie that resurrects the Last Son of Krypton can\'t be all bad. ""Watchman"" director Zack Snyder and scenarists Chris Terrio of ""Batman Vs Superman"" and Joss Whedon of ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" have not only brought Superman back from the grave, but they have also ushered the Flash/Barry Allen, Aquaman/Arthur Curry, and Cyborg/Victor Stone into the fray. Some may be disappointed to learn that this Flash (Ezra Miller) isn\'t the same Flash (Grant Gustin) in the WB\'s television series. Furthermore, Snyder and company shun frivolous romantic subplots since they have more than enough to keep them busy with the newest superheroes. Clocking in at two high-octane hours, ""Justice League"" doesn\'t dawdle Surprisingly, even with Joss Whedon aboard, ""Justice League"" qualifies as strictly by-the-numbers with few surprises. The first third dispatches Bruce Wayne (former ""Daredevil"" Ben Affleck) to recruit Barry Allen, Arthur Curry, and Victor Stone because an intimidating the ancient extraterrestrial villain threatening Earth—Steppenwolf (voice of Ciarán Hinds)—is more than the Dark Knight can handle. Says Wayne to Aquaman, ""I believe that an enemy is coming from far away. I\'m looking for warriors. I\'m building an alliance to defend us."" Steppenwolf looks and sounds sufficiently malevolent. This wicked superhuman warrior wields a nasty electro-axe and invades Earth with an army of google-eyed airborne predators called Parademons. Before he sets off in search of the new superheroes, Bruce Wayne reacquaints himself with Diana Prince (Gal Gadot of ""Wonder Woman""). She sneaks into his ultra-security equipped Bat Cave without tripping off any alarms. Reluctantly, Allen, Curry, and Stone agree to join up, but Aquaman/Arthur Curry isn\'t impressed initially with Bruce Wayne. ""What\'s your super power,"" the oceanic warrior asks. ""I\'m rich,"" replies Wayne.Unlike ""Thor: Ragnarok,"" ""Justice League"" confines its humor to clever dialogue quips. At one point, Alfred Pennyworth (Oscar-winner Jeremy Irons of ""Reversal of Fortune"") remarks to Wayne, ""I miss the days when one\'s biggest concern is exploding wind-up penguins."" This doesn\'t keep the Flash from enlivening the action with his fleet-footed frolics. Ultimately, once the Justice League has assembled, and Steppenwolf has uttered his ultimatum, the second third ensues with the resurrection of Superman (Henry Cavill of ""Man of Steel""), but he isn\'t particularly pleased with the Caped Crusader and what happened in ""Batman Vs Superman."" Wayne keeps a secret weapon in his arsenal to lure Kal-El back into the fold. Unless you\'ve skipped Superman\'s earlier exploits in ""Man of Steel"" and ""Batman Vs Superman,"" you should be able to guess what Batman has that can change Superman\'s mind. Death hasn\'t been too traumatic for Clark Kent. He has managed to preserve his magnificently muscled physique along with his incandescent laser-beam eyes. The final third pits the League against Steppenwolf, and this obnoxious hellion doesn\'t go quietly into that good night. Of course, you know that the Justice League will thwart Steppenwolf, but he doesn\'t go down with a fight.The biggest letdown about ""Justice League"" are the segments that introduce the various superheroes. Surely, Snyder and his writers, particularly Joss Whedon, could have conjured up something more exciting and less generic. The confrontation between Wonder Woman and a criminal gang planning to plunge the world back into the Stone Age lacks the ""wow"" factor. The same goes for the other superheroes. Batman unveils some impressive gadgets, namely \'the nightcrawler.\' Snyder relies again on CGI galore, as he did in ""Batman Vs Superman,"" but this is not surprising considering it depicts larger-than-life heroes and villains who perform the impossible. Altogether, despite its predictable plotting, ""Justice League"" delivers action aplenty and doesn\'t wear out its welcome.', 'After the death of Superman Batman sets out to form a coalition of superheroes: the Justice League.Your average modern superhero story: minimal plot, heaps of CGI and an attempt to cram as many superheroes, and supervillains, into the character list as possible.', '. . . by having a Junior Leaguer ask Bruce Wayne, ""What\'s YOUR Super Power?"" to which Wayne replies ""Money!"" Warner reinforces this warning to the World during the final, post-credits scene, in which a more plausible and life-like Billionaire--Lex Luthor--threatens to create ""a league of our own."" Warner Bros. realizes that anyone with a brain in their head will quickly dismiss Superman, Wonder Woman, and their Junior Leaguer Wannabes as Pure Fantasy, or so much Wishful Thinking. The red-haired Steppenwolf, on the other hand, is a Dead Ringer for American Strongman and Red Commie KGB Chief Vlad ""The Mad Russian"" Putin. To sum up, Warner warns us that We have met the Enemy, and it\'s Putin\'s Pedophiliac Repug Party (aka, The GOOPERS). These Billionaires brazenly instituted a Real Life ""League of Their Own"" to run EVERY ASPECT of American Life for we True Blue Loyal Patriot Honest Normal Average 99 Per Center Silent Majority Progressive Union Label Citizens. This Billionaire Ilk (along with their brain-washed toadies) MUST be exiled to someplace like Putin\'s Chernobyl, or that detached Delaware-sized ice berg floating along the Antarctic Coast, or Puerto Rico. This must be done ASAP, if We the Real Americans are to have ANY hope of survival, Warner Bros. warns us with JUSTICE LEAGUE.', ""When an alien invasion, led by the sinister Steppenwolf (Ciaran Hinds in a motion capture performance), seems imminent, Batman (Ben Affleck) recruits the world's heroes to stop it. He seeks out Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), Aquaman (Jason Momoa), The Flash (Ezra Miller), and Cyborg (Ray Fisher), but their combined power may not be enough, and they realize the one missing factor that could turn the tide of battle: the recently deceased Superman (Henry Cavill).This was another tortured production, with director Zack Snyder leaving the project either due to a death in the family or by the studio's insistence, depending on the source. Joss Whedon was brought on to finish the movie and ended up reshooting some earlier scenes. The final product seems rushed, under cooked, and dreadfully overloaded with too much unnecessary CGI effects. The common weakness in many of these superhero movies is the villain, and this is yet another example of that. The character is fully CGI and looks it, and it's difficult to feel menace from a cartoon in a non-animated movie. And the worst part is, it wasn't even needed, as the character was a normal human-looking person in the comic books, and the actor hired to basically just provide the voice, Ciaran Hinds, is a very good actor and would have been fine without the CGI embellishment. Another glaring visual flaw lies in Superman's mouth. Since the shoot ran over, Superman actor Henry Cavill was contractually obligated to start his filming on the upcoming Mission: Impossible film, a role that requires him to grow a bushy mustache. When he had to come back for reshoots on Justice League, the producers decided to just CGI out his mustache, with the end result a laughable, often deformed upper lip.On the plus side, Ezra Miller is amusing as The Flash, Gal Gadot continues to look great as Wonder Woman, and Momoa makes for an interesting twist on Aquaman, who is nothing like his comic book counterpart. Many of the acting heavy-hitters, including Amy Adams, Diane Lane, and Jeremy Irons, are just cameo window dressing."", 'With Superman dead, crime is rampant, hope is deteriorating, and Batman(Affleck, sad to be here, no longer brooding because it polled poorly) feels a need to redeem himself for his role in Big Blue biting the... spear. Paranoia apparently washes right off. He puts together a team(who will occasionally even work together when they face off against enemies) of people with powers, as evidence mounts of an alien invasion.This is essentially a series of well-done if repetitive(if Steppenwolf(Hinds, who voices a full CGI character brought to life with bad effects) is in a place, he\'s probably there to get a MacGuffin Box, and most likely, he\'ll get it. You wonder why these people even pretend to be keeping them from him, and if they couldn\'t have done more to make them hard to get to) action scenes, with materials connecting them – basically, you need to get the people from point A to point B, so every single fight isn\'t set in the same location. It is deeply forgettable. Meanwhile, I\'m not going to pretend I didn\'t enjoy myself. For many, that will be enough. It\'s very clear what is done by Snyder and what by Whedon, and both do some things right, other things wrong.Barry(Miller, funny, socially awkward) isn\'t annoying. Aquaman(Momoa, really going for that Wolverine status) comes off as a whiny adopted kid in an adult\'s body, and you don\'t buy him joining the rest. Cyborg(Fisher, going for RoboCop) goes back and forth between ""I can\'t control the unpredictable tech growing in me"" and ""here\'s how we\'re gonna do this because I now know what I can do and no problems accomplishing it"". The introduction of these three is rushed and underwhelming. It feels as though we\'re expected to have watched the three solo movies that have yet to come out yet. Wonder Woman(Gadot, who does raise a lot of the meh material she\'s given) is given little to do, and it\'s clear that those behind this don\'t love her character like Patty Jenkins, Gal, and 90% of everyone who watched her own film. Atlantis and Themiscyra feel like footnotes.I recommend you go in with adjusted expectations, rather than not at all. 6/10', ""JUSTICE LEAGUE (2017) *** Ben Affleck, Henry Cavill, Gal Gadot, Jason Momoa, Ezra Miller, Ray Fisher, Jeremy Irons, Amy Adams, Diane Lane, Connie Nielsen, JK Simmons, Amber Heard, Joe Martin (Voices of David Thewlis and Ciaran Hinds) DC Comics Superheroes first outing as a team features Bruce Wayne (Affleck) in turmoil in the death of Clark Kent (Cavill) but knows as Batman only he can stop a prevalent force from taking over the world by enlisting a group of fellow combatants including Diana Prince (Gadot), Barry Allen (Miller), Arthur Curry (Mamoa) and Victor Stone (Fisher) - aka Wonder Woman (getting all the prime fight sequences, smartly so) , The Flash (Miller's funny mix of Martin Short meets Jimmy Fallon looks and geeky charm) , Aquaman (Momoa proving the fish dude is more than he appears), and Cyborg (Fisher balancing the tragic and heroic) - to do battle to the death. Director Zack Snyder (who had to leave the production due to the tragic death of his daughter) - who co-wrote the screenplay with Chris Terrio and Joss Whedon - gets looser and goosier in allowing more fun, light and humorous moments to break thru all the gloom and doom at hand.

Together, Batman and Wonder Woman work quickly to recruit a team to stand against this newly awakened enemy. Despite the formation of a league of heroes, all your favourites.......and Cyborg, it may be too late to save the planet from an assault of catastrophic proportions.First off, Justice League isn't a disaster, it's not even a film, it's more of a two hour clip compilation of footage from a much longer, finished version.It does have problems, the narrative is incoherent, and there are plot holes aplenty, but despite the fact that it's just a compilation of ill advised quips and fights which consist of people flying around inhumanly toward poorly CG villains, it goes along at a steady pace.Snyder appears to have gone the opposite way that Marvel has, rather than introducing each character via a standalone film, we have extended introductions to all three of the new characters for the first two acts, then bring Superman back for the big showdown, which is just another CG heavy fight.The six heroes do have a lot of chemistry together, and even though Miller grates as The Flash, his humour is dour and falters quickly, and Affleck, no matter how good he was in BvS, just seems to be bored in his pivotal role.Cavil fares little better, but that's because you are too busy focusing on his CG chin rather than his characters cause.Thanks heavens for Gadot and Momoa, who bring some much needed life to the proceedings. Gadot is just as good as she was in her standalone film, and Momoa is fantastic as Aquaman, full old swagger and attitude, his standalone film could be something very special.The less said about Steppenwolf and Cyborg the better, and when it all comes to an end, you can't help but compare it to other superhero films, and predictably it pales in comparison.It should have been so much better, it had so much potential to be something better than BvS, it is, but you cannot help but think what it could have been.A disappointment for sure, but I still enjoyed what was nothing more than a clip compilation."", 'The film opens with camera phone footage of Clark Kent/Superman (Henry Cavill) recorded by two kids. They interview him just after one of his heroic missions. One of the kids asks Superman what his favorite thing about Earth is. He smiles but the footage cuts off before he gives his answer.It\'s now months later in Gotham City. A man (Holt McCallany) on a rooftop has just committed a robbery. He sees Bruce Wayne/Batman (Ben Affleck) perched on a gargoyle before he leaps over and fights the man. Batman dangles the man over a ledge, using the man\'s fear to lure out a strange, winged creature. Batman fights the monster until he traps it in a net. The creature explodes moments later, leaving behind three boxes burnt on the wall. Alfred (Jeremy Irons) sees this through the monitor. He tells Batman it\'s time to round up his team.It has been several months since Superman\'s death (from the film \'Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice\'); people all around the world still mourn him. Martha Kent (Diane Lane) has moved away from her rural home in Smallville while Lois Lane (Amy Adams) feels more alone.In London, a team of robbers stage a heist in a bank, holding the bank\'s customers as hostages. Standing atop a statue of the Greek goddess Themis (Lady Justice) Diana Prince/Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) leaps down to stop them. The leader of the robbers plans to use a bomb to destroy nearby technology and bring the city back to the Dark Ages, but Wonder Woman fights back and throws the bomb into the sky as it explodes. The leader then tries to shoot all the hostages; Wonder Woman runs and deflects all the bullets with her gauntlets. She then clashes the gauntlets together to defeat the leader.Bruce travels to a small town in Iceland to find Arthur Curry, AKA Aquaman (Jason Momoa). Bruce finds him in a tavern and offers him money to go with him, but Arthur declines. He also mentions that he knows about ""The Batman"" and his crime fighting in Gotham City, even expressing his admiration. He steps into the harbor and swims away at incredible speed.Bruce returns home to discuss matters with Alfred. After having no luck getting Arthur on the team, his other options are Victor Stone/Cyborg (Ray Fisher), who is presumed dead, and Barry Allen/The Flash (Ezra Miller), who has been foiling minor criminals with his blinding speed.Barry visits his father Henry Allen (Billy Crudup) in prison after he was locked up for allegedly murdering his wife when Barry was a child. Henry wants Barry to live his own life and to stop visiting him, because he doesn\'t have any hope that he will ever be freed.On Themyscira, the Amazons are guarding a cube known as a Mother Box. The cube has been pulsating with energy recently, reactivated from an unknown source. A beam comes down from the sky and a swarm of Parademons descend with their leader, Steppenwolf (Ciaran Hinds). He attempts to take the Mother Box, prompting the Amazons to fight back. Steppenwolf and his Parademons force the fight outside the temple where Queen Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen) tries to keep the box from their enemy in a furious chase across the countryside. Steppenwolf proves to be too much for the Amazons and succeeds in taking the box back wit him. Hippolyta then tells her general they must ignite a fire in a temple, because Diana will know what it means. Hippolyta fires the burning arrow, and Diana sees it on the news.At Star Labs, Silas Stone (Joe Morton) is leaving his job and goes home to Victor. Victor is hiding after everyone thought he died, and he is worried that his new appearance will have everyone see him as a monster. He also sadly remarks that his enhanced networking power bombards him constantly with knowledge of the entire world and that it feels overwhelming. His father pleads with him to hold on and that his powers will be useful.Diana goes to find Bruce. They walk by the lake near his forest home as she tells him the history of Steppenwolf and the Mother Boxes; three exist and if brought together, Steppenwolf would create The Unity, which destroys planets and reshapes them into the hellscape of Steppenwolf\'s home planet. Long ago, the Amazons, Atlanteans, and the Green Lantern Corps all joined forces to fight Steppenwolf and his army, sending him away and driving him mad. Anyone who fell in battle to Steppenwolf would be reborn as Parademons, the winged monsters Bruce has been tracking. The Amazons kept one of the Boxes, the Atlanteans kept another, while the third was kept hidden in secrecy by humankind so that nobody may be tempted to harness its power. As Bruce and Diana walk away, Cyborg is watching them nearby.Bruce locates Barry\'s hideout in Central City. While he knows who Barry really is, Barry denies it until Bruce throws a batarang, which Barry easily catches. Realizing Bruce is Batman, Barry agrees to join him. He flies them back to meet with Diana.Cyborg contacts Diana through Bruce\'s computer in the Batcave. They agree to meet up in an isolated location for Diana to try and convince Cyborg to join them, but he flies away before agreeing to anything.In a remote region of Russia, a poor family goes about their normal business in their small house, which sits in view of an abandoned nuclear power plant. Outside they hear a noise that sounds like insect wings flapping, only much louder. The family begins to barricade themselves inside. Outside, Parademons have descended on the nuclear power plant. Inside the one of the cooling towers, Steppenwolf places the cube he\'d stolen from the Amazonians in a stone monolith. Strange, thick roots suddenly emerge from the ground and spread to the surrounding area. Steppenwolf gloats that the Unity is at hand and he will take his place among the new gods and a being he calls ""Darkseid"".On the ocean, a fisherman is caught in a terrible storm. Arthur rescues him and brings him to the tavern for some whiskey. Arthur notices a viscous green substance on his fingers. He leaves the tavern and heads back down to Atlantis. Before he arrives, however, Steppenwolf and the Parademons invade and take the second Mother Box, battling the surprised Atlanteans. Mera (Amber Heard) tries to intervene as Arthur arrives, but the Mother Box is gone. He tells her he\'ll need something from her before he goes after Steppenwolf.Meanwhile, Police Commissioner Jim Gordon (JK Simmons) is alerted to a series of civilian kidnappings. He sends out the Bat Signal to contact Batman. Joined by Wonder Woman and The Flash, and then Cyborg, Gordon tells them what has happened, showing them a sketch from a witness: Diana identifies it as a Parademon. The four head off to save the civilians.Batman and his team track Steppenwolf to an island near Gotham Harbor. Steppenwolf and the Parademons are pressing their hostages for the location of the third Mother Box. One of the hostages is Silas, who had used the power of the Mother Box to revive Victor after his accident. Cyborg initiates the attack against Steppenwolf while The Flash, scared at first to get involved in combat but inspired by Batman, takes Steppenwolf\'s hostages to safety. The Flash rejoins Wonder Woman and Cyborg as they battle the Parademons while Batman uses his Nightcrawler to battle the Parademons. When Cyborg fires a missile from the Nightcrawler Steppenwolf, he easily catches it and aims it at the tunnel wall. Water from Gotham City Harbor floods in. Aquaman appears and stops the water from engulfing his allies with a five-tined fork given to him by Mara. The team escapes in the Nightcrawler.Back at Bruce\'s home, Cyborg reveals that Star Labs was holding the Mother Box. Bruce comes up with the idea to use the Mother Box\'s power to revive Superman so that he may help them defeat Steppenwolf. Diana disagrees with the plan for fear that Superman may come back the way Zod came back as Doomsday. Bruce tells them he has a backup plan in case Superman becomes violent and uncontrollable after his resurrection. Despite several misgivings about the plan, they decide to give the idea a shot. Barry and Victor go to the cemetery to dig up Superman\'s grave.The League goes to the Kryptonian ship in Metropolis with the Box and Superman\'s body. When Cyborg tells them the control panel is burned out, The Flash devises a plan to charge the field; he\'ll run from a distance to build a stronger charge. It works and Superman comes back to life, immediately rocketing out of the ship, and the others go after him. They find him nearby, at his memorial that was damaged in the battle with Doomsday. He scans them with his X-ray vision while Cyborg\'s defense system activates on its own. He fires a blast at Superman, leading him to attack the others. The League try to defend themselves as he comes close to killing them. They are stopped when Batman\'s strategy for subduing the confused Superman is revealed: Lois is brought to the scene. Superman calms down and flies away with Lois. Distracted by the fight with Superman, the team doesn\'t realize that Steppenwolf has taken the last Mother Box from the ship.Clark Kent and Lois are outside his old childhood home in Smallville. He still feels overwhelmed after being brought back to life, but Lois convinces him that the other heroes and the rest of the world need him. Moments later, Martha drives up and runs up to embrace Clark.In Russia, Steppenwolf brings all the Boxes together to begin The Unity. Everything around him starts to burn and decay. More of the huge roots burst from the ground, destroying anything in their path. The League arrives to begin the final showdown. Batman will take the troop transport they flew to the site in and penetrate the energy dome that has covered the nuclear plant. He\'ll use the Batmobile to broadcast a tone that attracts the Parademons while his comrades fight them on their way to Steppenwolf. The League is able to kill many of them and they advance to Steppenwolf and the Motherboxes. Communicating with Alfred, Batman sends The Flash out to rescue the family from the house.Cyborg tries to separate the boxes, and Steppenwolf tries to tear him apart. Just as it seems the tide of the battle with turn in Steppenwolf\'s favor, Superman arrives and begins to fight alongside the rest of the League. He hears the panicked voices of nearby civilians and rushes off to help them, guiding The Flash to the family that was attempting to flee the site. The Flash pushes their truck to safety, and then sees Superman carrying an entire apartment building to safety.Superman returns to the power plant where Cyborg has reassembled the leg Steppenwolf pulled from his body. Together, Superman and Cyborg pull the Boxes apart, stopping the transformation process. Enraged, Steppenwolf tries to finish them off himself, but Superman uses his ice breath to freeze Steppenwolf\'s ax, allowing Diana to shatter it with her sword. Now weakened and bewildered, the Parademons sense Steppenwolf\'s fear and begin to tear him apart as they are sent back to their world.Later, the heroes return to their homes. Barry gets a job with the Central City forensics department and he lets a proud Henry know about it. Victor works with his father at Star Labs. Bruce and Clark visit his childhood home and see that it\'s being returned to Martha Kent after it was foreclosed. Bruce tells Clark he bought the bank that owned it so he could return it to them. Arthur returns to Atlantis to fulfill his role as king. Bruce, Diana, and Alfred look into an abandoned building to establish the Hall of Justice. Lois then writes an article stating that there is once again hope out there. The last thing we see is Superman flying into the sky above Metropolis.Mid-Credits Scene: Superman and The Flash start a race to see who is faster, with a bet placed that if The Flash loses, he has to invite the others to brunch, and if he wins, he gets to tell everyone he beat Superman.Post-Credits Scene: Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg) has escaped prison and left a impostor in his cell. On his yacht, he is visited by Slade Wilson/Deathstroke (Joe Manganiello). Lex proposes an idea to Slade that they come up with their own little team... the Legion of Doom.']"
18,DC Extended Universe,Zack Snyder's Justice League,12361974,"[""I don't want to discuss the Machiavellian machinations that led to the butchery cut from 2017 and then to this one seeing the light of day - suffice to say that I am not hopeful for the future - yet I am grateful for them leading to me getting to see Zack Snyder's cut. Other than being way too long, it was a pretty perfect film. It would have been a much better business decision to split it into two films and getting twice the money from cinemas than to cut and reshoot it into stupidity.After watching this cut I knew why things happened, what the motivations of the characters were, including the villains, Superman's lip didn't make me cringe, new characters and story ideas have been introduced and I am hopeful for the DC Universe for the first time in a long time. Easter Eggs galore! And it also had a nice end scene that foreshadowed a possible continuation, but also gave enough so you understand what it could have been even if no film is being made of it. It's not a one minute Marvel post credit scene, it's a full on subplot about the future. Hell, it made me want to see more of Jared Leto!Is it perfect? No. There were some scenes that I would have gladly had edited out: people bursting in song like in a Bolly film, people climbing stairs, Lois Lane talking to Clark's mom, Lois Lane talking to a random street cop, Lois Lane standing still thinking, etc. The character of Cyborg's dad was also weak, even if I really like the actor.Bottom line: I thought that the 2017 cut had a bunch of characters that were not explored or otherwise pointless. The Snyder cut fixes all of that and adds meaning to everything everybody does. It's not mindless fun like the 2017, but has a shape and a place in the world and would have given me hope in the DC Universe if I didn't know only AT&T's desperation brought it to light."", ""There was a time I would go to the cinema, watch a movie like Superman II or Raiders of the Lost Ark. I would think I really liked that movie, could had done with another 30 minutes added on to it, what a ride.As I get older. Now when faced with the 3 hours long, The Avengers: Endgame. All I can think is will no one think of my bladder.There are countless examples of even 2 hour long movies nowadays where I think the director could had easily sliced 30 minutes off.This brings me to Zack Snyder's Justice League. All 4 hours of it.I planned to watch this over several days and to my surprise I did it all in one day.Although Justice League (2017) has Zack Snyder credited as the director. The film was largely reshot by Joss Whedon who delivered the final cut at 2 hours. Snyder has not even seen the movie.Fan pressure got the Zack Snyder cut released. It looks like everything Snyder shot is in it, some with better special effects added and Snyder even shot some new footage.This is a more coherent version. I remembered just how rushed some of the scenes were in Justice League and the accompanying music by Danny Elfman.In essence Whedon's rewrite and reshoots created a monster with two competing visions. Which then had to be heavily edited for a shorter running time.Snyder has been allowed to give his cut room to breath. The main beneficiaries are The Flash and Cyborg who have more of a backstory and utilised better here.Ray Fisher who played Cyborg has been pretty critical about how his character's part was reduced in Justice League and how he disliked the atmosphere created by Whedon.Steppenwolf also fares better in this movie with improved CGI. In Justice League I thought he was just a generic CGI villain.There are still some downsides. In the opening hostage scene with Wonder Woman. She could had disarmed the baddie as we can see she moves very fast. Instead Wonder Woman lets him reload his gun, all so she can blast him from the side of a building. How many people did the falling debris injure?When The Flash is running around near the speed of light. Cyborg is just standing there doing nothing, not even looking behind him to check if Steppenwolf is there. In fact there is a bit too much standing around in several action scenes when the mother box is the most important item to protect.Superman is still the casualty in both versions. A reduced role for the Man of Steel who has to return from the dead.There is no doubt in my mind this is the better version of Justice League. However the real challenge would had been could Snyder had delivered this movie with 90 minutes shaved off."", ""Zack Snyder's Justice League is one of the best-made and most successful DC films without a shadow of a doubt, thanks again to His Highness Zack Snyder. The visionary director manages, through the undaunted and determined flow of fans with the #releasethesnydercut movement, to bring his spectacular vision of the Justice League, presenting a spectacular film with parsimony and dedication, as only a true DC fan can do. Not only the film is deepened with a wealth of filmed material that no one ever imagined existed, but it manages to redeem itself and to fight with tight fists the previous Justice League (2017) which was a total and a colossal flop in every aspect (not Snyder's fault, of course). In this Snyder Cut all the questions that the Theatrical Cut did not give are answered, digging into the background of the characters and giving valid reasons where it seemed everything was thrown into turmoil and even randomly placed; moreover, the full potential of Snyder's direction is expressed through his unique and particular shots, also implementing and improving both CGI and cinematography, which are the perfect accompaniment to the director's vision. The four hours of the Snyder Cut are nothing more than a blaze of beauty towards these heroes, where with the old release seemed all too strange that they (production & co.) had offered so little from such a talented and resourceful director. Recall that the Snyder Cut must be contextualized and must be interposed in a timeline that had precedents and sequels in the DC Extended Universe, but now it is all to be reviewed, all to be rewritten, all to be reset. This film, as well as citing a similar case (although not entirely), namely The Godfather III Coda, totally redeems the film, putting everything in a new light, entrancing both fans and insiders and in doing so recreating a films from 0 (in fact much of the Theatrical Cut material is not present), bringing to light aspects never seen before and better set together and doing so, finally, being meaningful. Commendable and mouth-watering movie to learn more and that opens up worlds as well as in DC comics. Bravo Zack Snyder, Bravo. Justice has been served for the Justice League."", ""Zach Snyder's original version is 1000 x's better than the one Joss Whedon put in theaters. DC made a huge mistake not trusting Synder."", 'As a life long comic fan, DC characters are more close to my heart than Marvel characters. The first making of this film was just disappointing. It seems like there are bunch of idiots sitting on the WB executive positions who have no vision at all. The first film was literally incomplete. This one tells the full story and I must say nicely. This is the movie we, all the fans wanted and deserve.', 'Zack Snyder delivers by far his best film with Justice League. The film has an engaging story with a lot of heart and a great cast of characters who all have good chemistry together standouts being Ezra Millers Flash and Ray Fishers Cyborg. The film also has many easter eggs and cameos fans of the comics will recognize. Honestly as a big fan of DC this is my favorite DCEU film.', ""Zack Snyder's Justice league is an excellent movie. It is however 4 hours long. And I never got bored watching any of it. It's a masterpiece and testament to Synder's vision for his movie that we should have gotten to see back in 2017. He fixed the problems with Justice League (2017) and improved upon them, must watch for any comic book fan."", ""Zack snyder's justice league is far better than theatrical cut, in every way you can think of, steppenwolf is an actual threat now, his cgi is great, he has a clear goal, but cyborg is the heart of the movie and one of the best characters, Snyder did each hero justice, and flash powers are incredible and mind-blowing, Wonder woman is nothing like what we've seen in ww84, she is a valiant warrior and badass character, I really liked how they portrayed darkseid and paved the way for a potential JL2, he is an absolute great villain, and junkie xl music is really epic and great, overall 9/10 for this movie, I just had one problem with it: too much slow-motions NOW, it's time to RESTORE THE SNYDERVERSE"", 'No words can describe the experience. Seeing all the struggle come into life makes it amazing. Hundred times better than the theatrical cut.', ""If you are an obsessive fan of Zack Synder who was clamoring for this 4-hour cut, then you will likely be elated with the results. As someone who is neither hot nor cold toward most of his films, I cannot deny the craftsmanship on display here. That said, I liked it, didn't love it."", ""This movie is significantly higher quality. Almost everything they took out was for the better. Almost every change was for the better. The story makes sense. There are legitimate characters with arcs and everything. The visuals were beautiful, the music was beastly. And it is TRULY epic.The only reason i didn't give this a higher score is because, simply put, it's too long. I was never bored. And i always advocate for the artists (directors) creating art without studio interference. But while the original justice league is one end of the spectrum with studio interference up the butt, this seems like the other end, where the director is a bit overindulgent. Many of the scenes were completely unnecessary to the story and some even felt like deleted scenes from a dvd extra.Again, i was not bored, but rewatchability comes into play when i rate. I definitely want to watch this again, but the 4 hour runtime will significantly reduce repeat viewings. Somewhere in here, there is a 3 hour and 15 minute perfect cut which i would rate 8/10. (1 viewing, 3/21/2021) SPOILERS In the original the, the mother boxes were just a useless MacGuffin that I didn't care about, now the mother boxes are actually a huge part of the story. In the original the villain was the most bland cookie cutter villain ever, now I actually knew why he was doing what he was doing. In the original they took Superman to General zod's ship to revive him with the mother box and none of that made sense to me but I just went with it and didn't ask questions. Now it makes way more sensethe scenes i imagine should be taken out are some of the scenes with martha and lois, the martian manhunter stuff, and some of the epilogue. I thought the epilogue was cool, but it was out of place here. And it makes it worse if they're not continuing this storyline, which as of now they are not."", ""While it's not a perfect movie, Zack Snyder's Justice League is definitely better than Joss Whedon's version. Although it almost seems like cheating because Snyder got four hours to tell this superhero story, where the 2017 movie only had two. Still, this gives more room for character development, the storyline makes more sense, and there are some really cool moments. It didn't feel too long to me, actually, but I hope this doesn't usher in the era of 4+ hour films."", 'Zack Snyder\'s Justice League, retells the story of reviving superman and uniting heroes in one team to defend the planet from an ancient off the world evil, Darkseid.The whole movie is focused on the fight between the JL and Darkseid henchman, Steppenwolf. Yet it still have some good fight scenes aside from the huge number of goofs that you can spot left and right from the get go...you can simply - spot the fake gun silencer falling down while the terrorist at the beginning of the movie moves his hand - and this is the LEAST to say about the amount of goofs and silly spotted mistake allover the place with no spoilers.Let\'s talk technicalities without mentioning many details, The casting choices...I know this won\'t ""stay down"" for most but I\'ll say it as it is...Clearly they are settled for some weird reason with their casting choices but this is for them to troll the real fans with and for me not to watch, Superman I believe is a good choice, batman well he\'s ""OK"" (although I believe superman can be adjusted in the post production to look TALLER than Bruce Wayne but hey this is just me) but seriously Wonder woman ?! No blue eyed, let\'s just say ""well built"" actress out there ? I\'ll leave it at that and I bet comics fans get my drift, a short flash ?! I don\'t care how tall is the actor in real life but the bad directing and ugly cinematography makes him look way shorter than the others in almost all scenes. It\'s not a huge deal but an eyesore for true fans. But when it comes to Lex Luthor and the Joker casting well...this is what I call a sad joke! The DC casting generally nowadays is sad and all over the place! It\'s like the decision makers for the movies are teen girls!... From casting of the suicide squad to justice league not to mention the casting for the upcoming batman which is a laughable joke to say the least. But hey this is for them to screw up and for me to either not watch or free stream at best! ""Not Worth A Penny"".The story is a bit off at various points along the movie, the plot is very linear...a problem present itself then gets solved right away, every step is very convenient like it was written for children only. You can feel that the director is trying very hard to come up with a Very different version from the original but failing to stand out in my opinion. He tries so by mainly shoving more characters that fans like with no regards to their role or reason to exist in the movie.The CGI is good at moments, silly and laughable at others and a big WOW when it comes to the extremely stupid adaptation of the Flash! The Character itself, is Not the nerdy scientist guy we know, the lines makes him pretty much a stupid drunk person with nothing useful to add! The CGI is laughable and fails to show a proper mechanism of the Flash. It made me feel like he\'s swimming and sometimes jumping long distances in a puddle of goo! Not running super fast at all, even with the comics logic when flash moves in hyper speed his surroundings slows down but this does NOT means he slows down as well ! He should either move in a speed relative to our normal perspective or even faster but clearly the director lacks the brains that he force slow motion in every flash close up that we completely thrown off the concept of the character superpower.The so called ""Aquaman"", aside from the obvious ""ugly"" casting choice, most of his late fight scenes are WAY WAYYYY off. There\'s NO water in the surroundings, why do the filmmakers shove him in the fight scene jumping/flying around like a male wonder woman! Seriously wtf.Zack Snyder\'s Justice League is a mindless Ok to watch flick and may be enjoyable for some if you can spare 4 hours to kill without literally having anything else to watch. But far from standing out on any level.', 'The longer they are, the more time they get to set up the story The pace is perfect The stories of each character is perfectly timed Nothing feels rushed and the dark theme just ups the game Justice has finally been done to the reputation of justice league', 'A total work of art. The Synder version is so superior to the original in many ways. The only drawback is the length of the movie. It would have been better to cut it into two separate films.', ""Snyder Cut isn't flawless but it is far far better than Whedon's version. Lot of things makes sense now because of the additional scenes which gives context. Liked how Flash's & Cyborg's story is expanded. The epilogue episode in the end is totally unnecessary though."", ""Once again Zack Snyder has made another masterpiece when his original and true vision for his Justice League movie was released earlier this year to critical acclaim. The Snyderverse must be restored and Warner Bros must give full creative control over to Zack Snyder because he truly understands the DC universe like no other, it must happen. Every single event from Man of Steel and Batman vs. Superman has been building towards this epic masterpieceWith Superman now dead and with both Darkseid and Steppenwolf have been inadvertently notifed about his death thanks to Lex Luthor's communication with Darkseid's uncle, Steppenwolf now sets out on invading Earth to gather the three mother boxes, forming and synchronizing them to help Darkseid conquer Earth but also personally for Steppenwolf to be redeemed in his nephew's eyes after his inital betrayal. Steppenwolf is a complex and well developed villain just like Zod and Lex before him. You could literally feel in every scene Steppenwolf has with Desaad that not only is he determined to be redeemed, wanting to come home and get back in Darkseid's good graces, I think you can still feel his resentment for Darkseid since Darkseid is Steppenwolf's nephew, eternal boss and more powerful than he is so Steppenwolf has no choice but to serve his masterIt's also really awesome to see that despite how powerful Steppenwolf is by easily over powering the Justice League before the final battle with Superman's return or taking down many Amazons and Atlanteans to obtain the first two mother boxes, he becomes so submissive and perhaps afraid shedding most of his armour when Darkseid first makes contact with his uncle over the revelation that Steppenwolf has found the Anti Life Equation. It just goes to show the audience that if Steppenwolf is scared of his nephew despite being a force to be reckoned with, he is nothing compared to Darkseid when and if we will ever see him invade Earth for a second time in a future movieBatman, having his faith in humanity in restored as well as still feeling guilt ridden over Superman's death and wanting to redeem himself, sets on a request alongside Wonder Woman to recruit Aquaman, Cyborg and Flash to form The Justice League. At first things don't go to plan with recruiting Aquaman but it wouldn't take too long for him to come around and join the team. And yet despite their mission to save the world from Steppenwolf and Darkseid's inevitable return, the Justice League has problems of their own with Cyborg being bitter over that he is now a cyborg and views himself as a freak with a strained relationship with father. Flash is sort of an awkward but loveable and hilarious loner trying to get a a degree in criminal justice to help prove his father's innocence and Aquaman having mommy issues and turning his back on his own peopleHowever, despite these obstacles and managing to overcome their demons for the good of humanity and as well realizing they need to resurrect Superman to truly stop Steppenwolf, they manage to form a strong bond with one another. Almost like a family unit as each one overcomes their demons, no longer feeling alone and accepting each other. Seeing Superman come back from the dead in this version was truly special with a badass scene of fighting the Justice League as he didn't remember who he was until he saw Lois Lane. Plus the scene where Superman returned to his ship reminiscing over everything both Jor El and Johnathan Kent has said to him throughout his journey in life and it's from there Superman realizes who he is, what he is meant to do and has a second chance to realize his destinyThe final battle itself was just incredible with all members of the Justice League uniting as one to successfully takedown Steppenwolf, his army of Parademons and preventing both the mother boxes from synchronizing, and Darkseid from conquering Earth just as he tried to do centuries ago with Darkseid himself observing the final battle through a boom tube shortly before it closed and death of his uncle. Enraged but also determined knowing that his ' great prize' the Anti Life is on Earth vows to obtain it, destroy the Justice League and conquer the entire MultiverseWhat makes this movie even more special is despite the Justice League succeeding in the end or even that one brief moment where Steppenwolf had succeeded in synchronizing the mother boxes is that through Cyborg's visions of the future along with more glimpses into the Knightmare scenes, nothing was being done to prevent Darkseid from winning. It feels like it's inevitable Darkseid will obtain the Anti Life, conquer Earth and the Multiverse, turn Superman against the Justice League and destroy themI hope someday Zack Snyder is able to make Justice League 2 and 3 to see where his story and how the Justice was going to stop Darkseid was going to go. That and along with that scene of Lex Luthor hiring Deathstroke to kill Batman after revealing Batman's identity to Deathstroke. This needs to happen. The Snyderverse is the true version of the DCEU and it needs to be completedThis movie is so damn good, especially when you watch it after seeing Man of Steel and Batman vs. Superman first. It really didn't bother me that it was 4 hours, it could have been 10 hours and I would have been fine with it because those 4 hours of watching this amazing masterpiece just flyby every single time. Phenomenal story, gripping action, epic CGI and superb acting."", ""The original film was 2 hours long, this version comes in at 4 hours!From start to finish the film is literary a new film with more story, more action, more everything!Epic, amazing and can't wait for the sequel!4 years of wait finally ended..."", ""Justice served to all DC fans embarrassed by WB and Whedon (sent by disney, i think).2017 one was insulting for the 5 strongests of earth. They gathered and was moaning for superman's death and brought him back.

Yes they might still lose without superman. But here even if anyone of them doesn't rise they'll lose. Everyone had their part to play. It was the complete team work that defeated Steppenwolf.Cyborg got the backstory he deserved which got emotionally connected with viewers.

Note to Warner Bros: let Snyder continue this franchise. He really knows what he\'s doing!', ""If you look at this movie and forget about that the weeded cut exist, this was solid, so the last one was a disaster due to so many important aspects being cut and Josh Weeden the guy that directed the Avengers had to finish the movie, it had some ok scenes but was just pretty bad, it also looked bad, cgi just was really weird and colors looked off, Snyder had more bigger plans and I'm glad he got to show us his vision.The movie is way longer and deeply explains everything better, it was 4 hours so you can watch it as a long movie with maybe some breaks, it has a couple of parts and it shows it in the movie when a new part is starting, so you can maybe watch it like a show, 2 hours a break and then continue, there are many ways to do it.In this movie the music was better and as I said before, everything was longer and more deep. It had a more darker tone and the colors looked way more beautiful. It was also filmed in a different aspect ratio, it was a little different but pretty cool. I'm glad we got to see Snyder vision and a better improvement."", 'An amazing film, even with its horrendous runtime of 4 hours, that has a great build-up of characters that are more explanatory throughout and much better visuals with great editing and a de-saturated look. The action is immersive and much better than the construction of the original film with greater surprises, a beautiful soundtrack and scenes that leave you crying and scenes that leave your mind blown. Zack Snyder proves to the world that his dark universe is one to stay.', 'I would pay to see this on the big screen.I hope Mr Snyder can finish his trilogy.', ""This version is so much better than the originally released movie. At first, I didn't understand what all the excitement and hype were about when it was announced that the Snyder version was being released, but now I understand. The originally released movie was pretty awful. The storyline was disjointed and the character development was almost nonexistent. The Snyder version provided us with full storylines and character development for Cyborg and The Flash as well as eliminating some extraneous material that didn't add to the movie. If you like DC comics and were disappointed with the 2017 version of Justice League, go and see this version. You will be pleasantly surprised at how much better it is than the original."", ""Absolutely love this move. It's a masterpiece.

Something Darker\nEpilogue: A Father Twice OverThousands of years ago, Darkseid and his Parademons attempted to conquer Earth using the Mother Boxes after learning that Earth harbored the Anti-Life Equation. The attempt was foiled by a unified alliance of Old Gods, Amazons, Atlanteans, humanity, and a Green Lantern. After the battle, the Boxes were hidden in different locations, guarded by the Amazons, Atlanteans, and Humanity, respectively. In the present, Superman\'s death triggers the Boxes\' reactivation, attracting Steppenwolf, Darkseid\'s disgraced lieutenant, to Earth. Steppenwolf aims to regain Darkseid\'s favor by gathering the boxes to form ""the Unity,"" which would terraform Earth in the likeness of their world Apokolips.Steppenwolf retrieves a Mother Box from Themyscira, prompting Queen Hippolyta to warn her daughter Diana Prince. Diana receives the message and learns of the events related to Darkseid and Steppenwolf. She informs Bruce Wayne. Bruce and Diana seek to form a team of metahumans to protect Earth. Bruce locates Arthur Curry and Barry Allen, while Diana locates Victor Stone. Barry joins immediately, while Arthur and Victor refuse. However, Victor joins after his father Silas and several other S.T.A.R. Labs employees are kidnapped by Parademons seeking the humans\' Mother Box. Steppenwolf attacks an Atlantean outpost to retrieve their Box, forcing Arthur into action.The team receives intel from Gotham City Police Commissioner James Gordon, leading them to Steppenwolf\'s army in an abandoned facility under Gotham Harbor. Although the group rescues the kidnapped employees, the facility is flooded during combat, trapping the team until Arthur helps delay the flood so they can escape. Victor retrieves the last Mother Box, which he had hidden, for the group to analyze. Victor reveals that Silas used the Box to rebuild his body after a car accident and that the Boxes are ""change machines"" that unfalteringly enforce the will of their master, destroying or restoring to life without bias. The group decides to use the Box to resurrect Superman to help fight Steppenwolf. Barry and Victor exhume Superman\'s body and place it in the amniotic fluid of the genesis chamber in a Kryptonian ship kept in S.T.A.R. Labs. After Barry activates the Mother Box, an amnesiac Superman is resurrected, immediately attacking the group after Victor\'s cybernetics target him in self-defense. Lois Lane arrives just in time to calm Superman, preventing him from killing Bruce. Together, Lois and Superman leave for his family home in Smallville, where he regains his memories and reunites with his mother, Martha.Steppenwolf attacks S.T.A.R. Labs and retrieves the last Mother Box, though Silas manages to supercharge the Box with laser heat at the cost of his own life, allowing Victor to track it by tracing the heat. Without Superman, the five heroes travel to where Steppenwolf aims to unite the Boxes. The team fights their way through the Parademons to reach the Boxes but cannot distract Steppenwolf enough for Victor to separate them. Superman arrives and overpowers Steppenwolf, but the Boxes merge to form the Unity, causing a massive explosion. Barry enters the Speed Force and reverses time, allowing Superman and Victor to separate the Boxes. The heroes kill Steppenwolf and toss his body through a portal to Apokolips. Still, Darkseid assures his servant DeSaad he will return to Earth with their fleet to complete his quest for the Anti-Life Equation.After the battle, Bruce, Diana, and Alfred Pennyworth agree to set up a base of operations at the former Wayne Manor. As the team establishes, Diana receives another message from the Amazons, Barry acquires a job in Central City\'s police department which impresses his father Henry, Victor is inspired by a message from his father to use his abilities for good, Arthur bids farewell to Mera, and his mentor Nuidis Vulko as he goes to see his father, and Superman resumes his life as reporter Clark Kent and as protector of Earth.Lex Luthor, who escaped from Arkham Asylum, is visited by Slade Wilson, to whom Luthor reveals Batman\'s secret identity. After having a vision involving Victor, Barry, Mera, Wilson, the Joker, and an evil Superman in a post-apocalyptic world, Bruce receives a visit from the Martian Manhunter, who previously visited Lois disguised as Martha.

Nicole Kidman is the woman and she's the queen of the under sea kingdom of Atlantis and she's running away from all that. The two fall in love and have a kid who grows up to be Jason Momoa.But before that some Atlantian warriors show up and try to kidnap Kidman. They're all killed, but Kidman decides to go back lest more come and harm her son.One would have to be blind not to miss the parallels between the story of the Sword And The Stone and Aquaman. Momoa's earth name is Arthur Curry for that matter. Now all grown up and quite fit and cut he's summoned to Atlantis to claim the crown. But first he has to find a magical trident stuck in a rock somewhere in the sea. Can it get plainer than that.Aquaman also has a surface enemy in the son of a pirate whose father he killed when they were capturing a submarine.I did like the computer graphic special effects.used and loved the fantasy sea world that was created.I can hardly wait for the sequel."", ""AQUAMAN is the latest superhero blockbuster from DC Comics and a surprisingly lacklustre affair. It's not particularly awful, it's just that I felt indifferent towards it, particularly with a hackneyed storyline that goes through all of the motions without ever offering much in the way of originality or innovation. Jason Momoa is a likeable presence as the big bear-like hero of the piece, but the undersea kingdom material feels more than a little silly and it doesn't help that established stars like Willem Dafoe, Patrick Wilson and Dolph Lundgren all look ridiculous in their costumes. An inflated running time and juvenile script had me feeling like this was a NEMO sequel at times, and it all ends in a climax that just goes for CGI effect after CGI effect, ad nauseum. Try harder, guys..."", ""In 1985, lighthouse keeper Tom Curry rescues a woman from the stormy sea. She's Atlanna (Nicole Kidman), The Queen of Atlantis. They have a son together named Arthur. In order to keep him safe, she leaves them for Atlantis where she is forced to marry another. Her advisor Vulko (Willem Dafoe) is tasked to train Arthur.

The level of difficulty is high and he mostly clears it. I would have liked more space for some of the scenes to breathe. The movie is like a freight train without brakes. I need more moments in first gear to admire the sceneries and enjoy the humor. The pee joke is funny. The movie needs some calmer scenes to build good chemistry and do character work. I love the crazy war-crabs but it's sensory overload. The first speed bump occurs when Aquaman challenges Orm to a fight in the Thunderdome. It would have been more reasonable for Mera to bring Arthur to her father only to be ambushed by a double-crossing Orm. It would serve the same purpose without doing a big coliseum gladiator fight. It would also make Orm more underhanded evil. As for the creatures from The Trench, I would have preferred diplomacy instead of another fight. I expected a smarter twist where the monsters turn out to be intelligent.

Sure, it is a simple, dynamic, cool film for fans and young public. And it works. But the too familiar ""it could be better"" remains present at the end. Not exactly as accusation, but as a form of nostalgia about old fashion fantasy - action films. Sure, it is heroic and propose a high noble, powerful hero. But something is missing. What ? Maybe, in essence, the answer has no significance.', ""More than half a century ago, I was a Marvel comics fan during the Silver Age. One of the reasons I enjoyed them was the fact that amidst the planet-eating villains, there were superheroes with some human problems. Stan Lee may not have been the great writer he had once hoped to be, but he infused his characters with issues that at least symbolically attacked reality. Thus, the Fantastic Four dealt with family issues, the Hulk with anger management, and Peter Parker had all the problems of a teenager except acne.The DC extended universe, to give it its formal name, under the influence of Zack Snyder, seems to have concentrated on angst. While this has its uses, anger in its various forms does not lead to good solutions; for an audience of teenagers, this might work, but these comic-book movies appeal to alte kokkes like me, too. Thus the recent success of SHAZAM: some jokes, some nice symbolism, some reference to things that showed up in the comics when I was a kid.I did not see AQUAMAN in a theater. I had grown tired of the standard DC movie, but waited until it showed up on my TV. I regret this mildly. It is visually opulent, with the underseas segments beautifully decorated, lit and shot. clearly they would have shown well on a big screen. However, for much of it it consisted of men and women in costumes that would baffle a Halloween parade, slamming each other against hard surfaces and reacting less than I would stubbing a toe. If you cut me, do I not bleed? Yes I do. Not these fellows. Others may cheer these events, but for me, risk and reward must be balanced.Well, I've seen it now, and it's certainly watchable, if you like to watch these things, with the sort of cast that only sackloads of money can buy.

His sword in the stone.Jason Momoa is a limited actor. He is here for his muscles and some light hearted quips. Amber Heard is suitably sexy, Dolph Lundgren has a lot of screen time. Patrick Wilson is not a delicious villain in the mould of Loki.There are a lot of action scenes, some of it is well realised. James Wan has done a good job in pulling off this film. It is overlong but at least it did not end up in a watery grave.', '""Aquaman"" is a great adventure of Marvel, with Jason Momoa in the lead role and directed by James Wan. The film works and is supported by great cast and special effects. James Wan shifts from horror genre and makes a good adventure film. Names such as Willem Dafoe, Patrick Wilson, Nicole Kidman and Dolph Lundgren support this great production with the gorgeous Amber Heard. Looking forward for the sequel. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Aquaman""', ""May have plot spoilers.The film gives us the origins of Aquaman, who talks to fish, sort of like a parseltongue, except for fish and sea mammals which are different, but not in this story. Arthur/Aquaman's (Jason Momoa) first foe is Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II ) and then his half-brother King and then everyone except Amber Heard.Now Arthur cannot become King until he either pulls the sword from the stone or the lost Trident from King Atlan. This isn't any Trident. It is made will Posiden steel and has a genuine Corinthian leather grip. The script raised some questions. Why is Aquaman desperately hanging on to the edge of a roof when he can jump out of a perfectly good airplane without a parachute? And why would he take a slow-moving fishing boat anywhere? They attempted to make Amber Heard's first time on the surface cute but not clever. Are Atlantians the only sea mammals that never have to breathe air?I couldn't help but think of Avatar...this needs a 3D IMAX. Superman does not die in the end.Guide: language was a little salty."", ""You can't argue with the fact that Jason Momoa is a total and utter Adonis, he certainly looked the part, even if I didn't think his acting was particularly incredible. I wasn't expecting much, but I actually really enjoyed it, it's not the usual type of film I go in for, but I did enjoy it. I didn't understand why some things were happening, there were odd explosions and random events going on, but who cares, it was all in keeping with this real life cartoon. I preferred the first hour to the latter stages of the movie, but overall I really enjoyed.Bold, brash, awesome effects, lots going on. Enjoyed. 8/10"", 'Is DC getting their mojo back? Did they lose it? Or was it just the overall power of Marvel that just seemed to squash DC? With James Wan at the helm who got famous with being one of the minds behind the Saw franchise (one of the most important ones that is), there is experience at the helm. And he really brings a lot of humor into it - like the bar scene which goes against what people would expect from that.But for every scene like that, you also have a scene with one of the movies villains who is so over the top, you would suspect him to be comical (no pun intended), but he is dead serious. Shame for missing out on something that could have been really great. Jason Momoa on the other hand is having a lot of fun. And all the cast is having a lot of fun (maybe even the crazy villain in between takes, definitely not on camera). A lof women (and some men) will love this regardless of story, just being visually ""attracted"" to it and that is ok. For everyone else, you can have fun with this if you don\'t overthink it', 'The movie is visually impressive, I\'ll give it that. The underwater battle scene with opposing sides on sea horses and sharks was exceptionally well done. Story wise, though, it was fairly formulaic, and quite honestly, after about the first hour or so, I started getting bored with it. The dialog in particular was rather mundane for such a high profile movie coming out of the DC Comics universe. When Aquaman\'s (Jason Momoa) response to one of his beleaguered foes, (can\'t even remember who that was now), was \'Screw you!"", I could only groan in embarrassment. This is not what I expected to be coming from the mouth of the future King of Atlantis.I thought Jason Momoa was a very good choice for the Aquaman role. He has a regal bearing even before his destiny is revealed and I think he\'s a credit to the DC universe. Maybe it was Amber Heard\'s brilliantly rendered red hair, but I couldn\'t warm up to her character as Mera, Aquaman\'s future queen. The rest of the A-list cast was generally OK, although personally, I don\'t think Nicole Kidman should come anywhere near super-hero movies based on comic books.Though my rating of the movie is favorably high, it\'s all due to the cinematography and capable CGI utilized by the film makers. The after credits sequence sets up the sequel with Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), who didn\'t impress me this time around as the second tier villain behind King Orm (Patrick Wilson). His look was kind of cheesy and too cartoony for my tastes, perhaps a bad harbinger for the follow up Aquaman flick.As an aside, I couldn\'t get over the huge amount of one line reviews this picture has here on IMDb since it came out. They really offer nothing in the way of an individual writer\'s support or distaste for the movie other than to say they like it or hated it. Could do that in a tweet. I guess that says I\'m in favor of going back to the ten line requirement that IMDb used to have.', 'We first saw the popular DC Comics character when he joined the team in Justice League, this was the first full-length centred around him, and the sixth entry in the DC Extended Universe, which has been a mixed bag, I hoped for some improvement, directed by James Wan (Saw, Insidious, The Conjuring). Basically in Maine, lighthouse keeper Thomas ""Tom"" Curry (Temuera Morrison) rescues princess Atlanna (Nicole Kidman) from the underwater nation of Atlantis during a storm. She stays on land, they fall in love and have a son, Arthur (Kaan Guldur and Otis Dhanji), who is born with the power to communicate with marine lifeforms. Atlanna is forced to abandon her family and return to Atlantis, she gives her loyal advisor Nuidis Vulko (Willem Dafoe) the mission to train Arthur. With his guidance, Arthur becomes a skilled warrior but is rejected by the Atlanteans for being a half-breed and ultimately leaves Atlantis behind. One year after Steppenwolf\'s invasion, Arthur (Jason Momoa) confronts a group of pirates attempting to hijack a nuclear submarine. Their leader, Jesse Kane (Michael Beach), is trapped under rubble during the confrontation, he forces his son David (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) to leave him behind to drown, David vows revenge against Arthur. David later targets Atlantis at the behest of King Orm (Patrick Wilson), Arthur\'s younger half-brother and ruler of Atlantis who plans to declare war on the surface. King Nereus of Xebel (Dolph Lundgren) swears allegiance to Orm\'s cause, but his daughter Mera (Amber Heard), who is betrothed to Orm, refuses to aide them and journeys to the surface to ask Arthur for help, she earns his trust by saving Thomas from a tidal wave sent by Orm. Arthur reluctantly accompanies Mera to a rendezvous with Vulko, he says if he can find the Trident of Atlan, a magic artifact that once belonged to Atlantis\' first ruler, he will reclaim his rightful place as king. They are ambushed by Orm\'s men and Mera and Vulko escape, while Arthur is captured, Orm visits Arthur in captivity and tells him Atlanna was executed for the crime of having a half-breed son, he blames Arthur and the surface for her death. Orm offers Arthur an opportunity to leave forever, but Arthur instead challenges him to a duel in a ring of underwater lava, Orm has the upper hand, but Arthur is rescued by Mera. Together, Arthur and Mera journey to the Sahara Desert to find information about the trident, a holographic message found in a chamber beneath the desert leads them to Sicily, where they retrieve the trident\'s coordinates. Meanwhile, Orm provides David with Atlantean armour and weaponry and sends him to stop them, he imprisons Vulko after learning of his betrayal, and coerces the remaining kingdoms of Atlantis to pledge allegiance to him and his campaign against the surface. In Sicily, David, now calling himself Black Manta, ambushes Arthur and Mera and injures Arthur before falling off a cliff to his apparent death. Mera nurses Arthur\'s wounds as they journey to find the trident, she encourages him to embrace his destiny as a hero. Arriving at their destination, Arthur and Mera are attacked by amphibious monsters known as The Trench, they manage to fend them off and enter a wormhole that transports them to an uncharted sea located at the centre of the Earth. They Arthur is shocked to be reunited with Atlanna, she was sacrificed to the Trench for her crimes, but she escaped them and reached the uncharted sea, where she has been stranded ever since. Arthur must face mythical leviathan Karathen (Dame Julie Andrews), who guards the trident, he voices his determination to protect both Atlantis and the surface, proves his worth and is able to reclaim the trident, which grants him control over the seven seas. Arthur, Mera, and Atlanna lead an army of marine creatures in battle against Orm and his followers, it is after learning that Arthur wields the trident and is the true king that the followers renounce their obedience to Orm. Arthur defeats Orm in combat but chooses to spare his half-brother\'s life, Orm accepts his fate after seeing that Arthur has found and rescued their mother. Atlanna returns to the surface to reunite with Thomas while Arthur ascends to the throne with Mera by his side. During the credits, Black Manta is rescued by Dr. Stephen Shin (Randall Park), he agrees to take the scientist obsessed with finding Atlantis to the underwater kingdom in exchange for his help in his revenge on Arthur. Also starring Ludi Lin as Captain Murk, Graham McTavish as King Atlan, Leigh Whannell as Cargo Pilot, John Rhys-Davies as the voice of the Brine King and Djimon Hounsou as the voice of King Ricou. Momoa does a great job as the charismatic Atlantean prince who has a destiny, Heard is compelling as his sexy red-head sidekick, Wilson is rather stiff as the villain, Kidman is really likeable, and Lundgren does alright as well. I will admit most of the dialogue is cheesy, it is ridiculous at times, and it is perhaps a little too long, but the special effects going underwater and on land are brilliant, and the fast-paced fight and explosive sequences are engaging, it is fun to watch, a worthwhile superhero action adventure. Good!', 'Alright, well for starters I must state that I am not one overly keen on watching superhero movies, because they all just seem to follow the same doctrine and blueprint. But I was forced into watching the 2018 DC ""Aquaman"" movie together with my family.And it turns out that it was actually a good thing that I was forced to watch it. Because it turned out that ""Aquaman"" was actually one of the better superhero movies that have been made. Not that I am in anyway familiar with the backstory of the character and haven\'t read the comic books or anything.Initially I was a little bit hesitant about the movie, but it turns out that director James Wan actually managed to turn the written material of David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick, Will Beall and Geoff Johns into something truly entertaining and enjoyable. The movie was driven by a good story, where one quickly and easily got submerged, no pun intended, into the setting and into the ongoings on the screen. Plus it was also a plus that it had some rather interesting characters in it to help it along as well. Needless to say that the CGI and special effects also had a major role in making it a visually astounding and enjoyable movie.Now, normally I am not much fan of Jason Momoa, but I must admit that he really carried himself formidably in this movie and he really owned up to the responsibility of playing Aquaman - although I have no idea how much pressure would be on him to play that character. But he did it phenomenally in my opinion, regardless. It was of course a treat to see Willem Dafoe in the movie, despite it being somewhat disturbing and unsettling to see him made young and vigorous. Patrick Wilson actually was so well-cast for the role he had in the movie, and he brought so much grace, charm and wits to that dark character. I had initially not thought he would be up to the task, but he proved me so wrong. Then you have the likes of Nicole Kidman and Dolph Lundgren whom also actually were fun to watch in the movie, despite them not having an abundance of screen time.The pacing to the movie was fast and upbeat, and the movie kicked off into a high octane speed right from the very beginning and it never really slowed down. Which was a very impressive accomplishment in my opinion, and it really made the movie all the more intense and enjoyable to sit through.As for the special effects and CGI. Well, there is just really just a single word necessary to summarize the entire movie. And that word is: wow! Are you kidding me, this movie takes you in for a tour de force and really showcases some rather impressive feats and accomplishments in the visual department and also in the audio department. Prepare to be blown away.With that being said, the movie is not at all flawless. Personally I found it a bitter pill to swallow the whole thing about the Secret Sea and what was going on there. It was just too far out there for my liking. And also the fact that all the marvelous, magnificent, malignant and spectacular aquatic creatures, vehicles and settlements have remained from the humans living on the surface is just beyond me. It makes absolutely no sense at all.Now, I was praising the CGI and visual effects just before. There were some scenes when we have the characters floating around and supposed to be appearing as if they are submerged and underwater, it just came off as being ridiculously fake to look at. That was a shame, because the rest of the 95% of special effects and CGI in the movie was just spot on.If you enjoy superhero movies. Wait, let me rephrase that. Even if you have no particular interest in superhero movies, then you should actually take the time to sit down and watch the 2018 ""Aquaman"" movie. It is definitely well worth the time, effort and money.', ""Okay, I definitely could have done without the octopus playing the drums, but Aquaman isn't the dud that many claim it to be. It's certainly better than many of DC's dark and dreary superhero movies, a visually impressive treat for the eyes (and I'm not just talking about Amber Heard in her green skintight costume!) and, ignoring a few contrived plot details, a hugely entertaining romp.Director James Wan has created a DC movie that, for once, looks and feels like a comic-book come to life, with jaw-dropping production design and dazzling neon coloured imagery that is breathtakingly beautiful. The story is clichéd baddies versus goodies nonsense, but I think that's the point: this is intended to be brainless fun without all the emotional intensity and gloominess that made Nolan's Batman films such a bore. It's got Willem Dafoe riding a shark, for Christ's sake - it's not meant to be taken seriously.Jason Momoa plays Arthur, son of a lighthouse keeper (Temuera Morrison) and the Queen of Atlantis (Nicole Kidman). When he grows up, Arthur is convinced by stunning redhead Atlantean Mera (Heard) to claim his rightful place as king of Atlantis in order to prevent a battle between the sea folk and the land dwellers. Unfortunately, his half brother Orm (Patrick Wilson) is intent on war...At almost two and a half hours long, this could have easily run out of steam, but Wan keeps things moving at a lick, introducing more and more bonkers action, building to a climactic war between an army of talking crustaceans and the shark-riding Atlanteans, with Momoa joining in the fun atop a massive monster from the depths. Oh, and Nicole Kidman spends twenty years in Jurassic Park at the centre of the Earth! It's all so gloriously daft, and so stunningly rendered that I couldn't help but enjoy myself.The film does overstep the mark occasionally, with some the humour falling flat, and I struggle to believe that a) Aquaman and Mera would bring a seemingly insignificant bottle with them to Sicily, and b) the statue designed to hold the bottle is conveniently still standing intact in the same place after thousands of years, but these are minor niggles in a movie that hits more than it misses.7.5/10, rounded up to 8 for scorching redhead Heard."", 'This is a good popcorn movie, but I watched it at home on BluRay from my public library. It has a lot of very deep bass in many scenes and often rattled the glass doors covering the fireplace.The star is Jason Momoa as Arthur, the product of a union between a lighthouse operator and a mysterious injured woman from the sea. He is destined to become Aquaman. Momoa has the looks and at 6\'-4"" has the stature to be legitimate in that role.His nemesis becomes Patrick Wilson as the underwater King Orm, the half-brother of Arthur. Their mother is Nicole Kidman as Atlanna. Each very effective in their roles. The general thrust of the story is Orm is unhappy with how humanity has been treating the world, both above and below the waves, and wants to conquer all to make things right. Arthur, being of both ancestries, seeks to instead promote cooperation. So naturally a mighty battle settles that issue.The computer graphics and special effects are really great, but for my tastes there is just too much frantic battles and destruction in the scenes leading up to the conclusion. I most enjoyed the first 1/3rd of the movie plus the last couple of scenes.', 'I first knew of Aquaman as a kid of the \'70s when watching him in the animated series ""Superfriends"" when he was teamed with his more-established mates of Superman, Wonder Woman, and the team of Batman & Robin. There, he was clean shaven and had blond hair. He was also bland as were the other heroes considering they were on Saturday morning which were mostly kid shows at the time. Here, he has a beard and has much darker hair. He also has something of an attitude which is refreshing to see! But he\'s very much the good guy and he has many great adventures here. Jason Momoa is aces in the role and it\'s also nice seeing that guy who was Green Goblin in the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man film (Willem Dafoe) play someone more sympathetic here. In summary, Aquaman has such a fine story and great action set pieces, that I heartily recommend it!', ""This film tells the story of a half breed son of the Queen of Atlantis, who is forced to fight for the throne.The visuals are spectacular, and the number of famous faces also adds to the entrainment value. However, I find the story a little too focused on negative stuff. It doesn't offer much hope, love or positive vibes in general. It is also very much anchored to fantasy, and it feels very detached from life. I guess that's why I prefer marvel films."", 'I like the bit with the really big wave and the ships.', 'Aquaman""Aquaman\'s Under-Water Bio-luminescent Water-Scape is as Busy, as well, it\'s Director James Wan.His Indefatigable Effort in Bringing a Never-Before-Trip to the Depths of the Ocean,Where the Sunken Atlantis Thrives with its Inherent Technological Expertise is on Full-Display..And What a Display it is.Defying Knee-Jerk Critics and Fanboys to Utter ""Seen-it-all-Before"".Truth is, this is a World of Wonder that can Make the Best Theme-Park Envious.There is a Line-to-Cross when Filling the Frame with Eye-Candy,so Readily Available in the Mega-Budget of Super-Hero Movies and Wan Doesn\'t Step Over the Line,He Dives Over-the-Line with the Confidence of an Olympian.So Confident and Sure that what He has in Store for Thrill-Seeking Fans,will Embrace the Comic-Book Come to Life that is the Visual Treat that ""Aquaman"" has to Offer.What it Offers in Abundance is the Sense of ""Artistic Vision"" that is Central to ""Reading"" a Comic.You are Transported to Another World, Another Reality where ""Logic and Proportion"" is Turned on its Head as You Descend Down the ""Rabbit Hole"".That\'s the Appeal of Comics.The ""Stars"" are Secondary.

Good CGI, but that's a given nowadays."", '. . . it might prove to be the straw that breaks the Kraken\'s back, the always eponymous Warner Bros. warn the World with AQUAMAN. For many decades Warner\'s prophetic prognosticators have warned Earthlings about their upcoming Calamities, Catastrophes, Cataclysms, and Apocalypti. AQUAMAN is one of Warner\'s most urgent such warnings in the History of Time, as it deals with ""the Wrath of the Seven Seas"" being unleashed upon you land lubbers. Warner\'s clairvoyant seers predict Dire Consequences if you insist upon bagging your groceries with disposable sacks or gulping your fluids from plastic water bottles and Styrofoam coffee cups. Cigarette butts, loose beer can tabs, indestructible six-pack rings, medical waste, worn-out vehicle tires, rusty shipping containers, and ""moth-balled"" fleets are among some of the most egregious environmental excesses sure to draw Poseidon\'s Wrath, AQUAMAN cautions. You can keep denying Global Warming and Ocean Pollution till you\'re blue in the face. Just remember that finding a replacement Earth will be like looking for a straw in a haystack!', 'There was embarrassing writing, embarrassing acting, and listening to Amber Heard trying to deliver this terrible dialogue with zero inflection was exhausting. Why does half of the population of Atlantis sound like they\'re from California? The dialogue was never more than cliche with a predictable plot. The ""advanced ancient civilization hidden away from the world"" trope is already old. There was so much CGI that none of the action ever felt impressive or tense or real. Any time someone said ""Ocean Master"" with a straight face I wanted to laugh.This would\'ve been the perfect movie to not take itself too seriously, go for a more lighthearted and irreverent tone like Thor Ragnarok, but they just try so hard. It has none of the superhero charm that Marvel manages to carry over from the comics and thus you have one very long boring slog.How many scenes did we need where a quiet moment was interrupted by an exploding wall that didn\'t hurt anybody? I counted three or four. Also, that paint-by-numbers forced romance - ""Wow there was a surprise and now we\'re accidentally holding hands"", ""Wow there was an explosion or something and I grabbed you "" - give me a break. And whoever put together the soundtrack for this film should be summarily executed.', 'While Arthur(Momoa, charming) has known since childhood that he is Prince of Atlantis, he\'s been reluctant to claim the title and has instead stayed on land. However, when his half-brother Orm(Wilson, really committing to the role) threatens war on the surface world, which could kill millions of people, he has to embrace his nature. The only way for him to succeed is to work with Mera(Heard, her cynicism a cover for a sweetness and willingness to sacrifice herself), despite not getting along with each other, and neither of them having faith in him.This is entirely unashamed of itself. It is proudly and decisively going all out. I\'m not going to claim that everyone who criticised it either ""don\'t get it"" or don\'t at all have a point that its tone vacillates awkwardly between different ones, such as Lord of the Rings epic and cartoony comic book. Your mileage may vary. For me, it grabbed me from frame one and I was with it all the way through. It\'s so infectiously in love with its world, which really is unlike anything seen recently in movies from Marvel or DC. I\'m not sure of when there last was a picture like this that didn\'t get a lot wrong. There is a lot of mythology at play here. Thought this was about a single nation of the Sea? Wrong. There are seven. Those clips of a massive battle in the trailers? It\'s freaking amazing. And I would have to strongly disagree with those who say it goes on for too long. This has the best action scenes I\'ve seen since Infinity War(no, course it doesn\'t top that, how could it possibly?). They are easy to follow, the camera moves to take in the scope and keep the energy up, they are varied and distinct from each other, and they take advantage of the cool concepts at play here: dozens, maybe a hundred, underwater creatures utilised for transport and attack, as well as plasma guns and other futuristic tech. Although this film doesn\'t top Wonder Woman in every way, it\'s definitely in the top two. Warner Brothers: put as much of this franchise in the hands of Patty Jenkins and James Wan, and the DCEU will thrive.There is a lot of sci-fi violence, some disturbing content, and a little strong language in this. I recommend this to anyone who likes superheroes. 8/10', 'Greetings again from the darkness. Were the TV series ""Entourage"" still on the air, they would now need a new recurring punchline. The AQUAMAN movie is real! At the helm, we are surprised to find the master of horror, James Wan, in the director\'s seat. Mr. Wan is known for such genre flicks as SAW, INSIDIOUS, and THE CONJURING, and his talent for visuals transfers well to the comic book style. In fact, with a run time of almost 2 ½ hours, the visual effects are both exhilarating and exhausting.Sure, we\'ve seen short bursts of Jason Momoa as Aquaman in a couple of previous DC movies, but this time he owns the pool. Momoa plays Arthur Curry as a hunky beer-chugging rock and roll party dude who just happens to talk to fish and breathe underwater. Since it\'s the first Aquaman movie, writers David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick (ORPHAN) and Will Beall (GANGSTER SQUAD) provide us the backstory.On the coast of Maine in 1985, a lighthouse attendant named Tom Curry (played by Temuera Morrison) discovers Princess Atlanna (Nicole Kidman) washed ashore. What follows is a whirlwind romance, the birth of their son Arthur, Nicole snacking on a goldfish, as well as her first kick-ass action fight scene. To protect her son, she agrees to head back to Atlantis where she faces the consequences of birthing a half-breed with a landlubber.When we first see a grown Arthur - with a classic hair flip - he is thwarting the hijacking of a Russian submarine by Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) and his father (Michael Beach, IF BEALE STREET COULD TALK). Manta is one of the two main villains - the other being Orm (Patrick Wilson), Arthur\'s war-mongering, power-thirsty half-brother. Sharing a common enemy, Orm enlists Manta and provides a highly-advanced weapon that, for some unfathomable reason, Manta begins (via montage) to \'Iron-Man\' it to another level - one much less stable. It\'s Orm who gets much more screen time as he plots a massive attack on surface dwellers (humans) who have been destroying the sea for years. You didn\'t think Hollywood would miss a chance to tell us how despicable we are, did you?The basic story is that Orm must defeat Aquaman to claim the throne and become Master of the Sea. Of course, Arthur is reluctant to get involved and only does so at the urging of his old mentor Vulko (Willem Dafoe) and Mera (Amber Heard), both of whom wish to avoid a war with humans. The first battle of the would-be kings takes place in The Ring of Fire, a royal battleground missing only the accompaniment of Johnny Cash. The duel ends prematurely, so that an epic battle can later serve as the film\'s epic climax.Although director Wan may throw a bit too much \'plot\' and action at the proverbial wall, it is interesting to note the history/mythology associated with Atlantis, the ruling class, and the missing trident. The legends are fascinating and the journey takes us to all ends (and depths) of the globe ... from the deepest seas to the middle of the Sahara Desert (itself once a sea) to the incredible core of the Earth. We see the ancient ruins, as well as the high-tech futurama Atlantis ... and it\'s all stunning to watch.Don\'t tell Marvel, but the film is somewhat a blend of BLACK PANTHER and THOR, and Momoa is every bit the Aquaman that Chris Hemsworth is Thor (quite a compliment). Yes, we find out that Atlantis, like our dry land world, is burdened with politics and power-hungry types, but the underwater world and the visual effects keep us mesmerized. We see terrific dragon-like sea horses, a drumming octopus, and a Kraken-like creature supposedly voiced by Julie Andrews (fact or fiction?). There is an early sequence that takes swimming with dolphins to a level you didn\'t experience on your vacation, and the lighting effects at times recall TRON and can be a bit disorienting.This is probably the largest scale DC movie to date, and director Wan chooses to make a splash with every element - character, mythology, setting, and effects. We also get appearances from Dolph Lundgren as King Nereus and Randall Park as a TV talking head/oceanographer making the case that Atlantis is real and a threat. We even get Roy Orbison singing ""She\'s a Mystery to Me"", and the IMAX aspect ratio makes the first ever over-the-top underwater spectacle. And what a spectacle it is.', 'Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa) lives with his father on the Maine Coast, a caretaker of a lighthouse. With the mentorship of Vulko (Willem Dafoe) and the revelations of Mera (Amber Heard) he discovers that he is the half-breed heir to the underwater kingdom of Atlantis. As the rightful successor to the throne, he must tangle with his brother Orm (Patrick Wilson) to save the surface world from destruction. Meanwhile Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) seeks vengeance on Arthur for the death of his father.""Aquaman"" (2018) is a colorful superhero flick featuring a flashy action scene for every 5 minute lull. It\'s reminiscent of ""Thor"" (2011) and ""Thor: The Dark World"" (2013), but with spectacular undersea realms instead of Asgard & realms nearby. Yet the drama was better in those movies whereas here it feels like the creators were in a rush to jump to the next action sequence, which might make ""Aquaman"" \'thrilling,\' but less compelling story-wise.Still, it\'s very eventful with loads of energy (maybe TOO eventful for its own good). And I liked the balance of underwater scenes to surface scenes with spectacular locations, including the Sahara Desert and Sicily. Meanwhile Amber is stunning as redheaded Mera. Even Nicole Kidman shows up as Arthur\'s mother, Atlanna. Speaking of Arthur, Momoa is magnificent as the protagonist and will forever change the public\'s generally weak perception of Aquaman.The film is a bit overlong at 2 hour, 23 minutes; and was shot in Australia (Hastings Point, Amity Point, Southport, Main Beach & Currumbin Beach); Newfoundland & Labrador, Canada; and Morocco (Erfoud & Merzouga).GRADE: B/B-', ""The story opens in the small, seaside village of Amnesty Bay, Maine, in 1985. On a very stormy night, lighthouse keeper Thomas Curry (Temeura Morrison) discovers an unconscious woman (Nicole Kidman) washed up on the shore with a wound in her abdomen. He brings her to his home and shelters her. Although she appears frightened and confused when she wakes up, Thomas shows her kindness and tends to her wound. She tells him her name is Atlanna, queen of Atlantis, and the two begin a romantic relationship.Thomas and Atlanna spend the next few years together, and they become parents to a son, Arthur. Everything seems lovely until one day when a team of Atlantean commandos burst into their home and start to attack with the intention of taking Atlanna back to her betrothed, King Orvax. Atlanna fights back and beats the commandos down, leaving her time to get away with Thomas and Arthur. Atlanna tells Thomas she must return to Atlantis for his and Arthur's safety, but she vows to return to both of them someday. She kisses Thomas goodbye and jumps back into the ocean, leaving Arthur her five-tined sea fork for when he is ready to use it.Years later, we see Arthur as a child on a school field trip to the aquarium. He is seen talking to the fish, and two bullies start to taunt and mock him for it. A shark then starts banging on the glass, cracking it slightly and scaring everyone else. They watch in astonishment as all the sea creatures gather right behind Arthur, and his eyes glow yellow as he has them at his command.Twenty years later, a team of pirates led by Jesse Kane (Michael Beach) and his son David (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) take over a Russian submarine. After subduing the men on board, the villains find that they hit something, or rather, something hit them. It's the now adult Arthur (now played by Jason Momoa), better known by many as Aquaman, coming to the rescue. He makes his way into the sub and starts fighting the pirates, laying them all out with ease before going after the Kanes. Jesse fires an RPG at Arthur, thinking he's killed him, but Arthur picks himself up, completely unscathed. Arthur retaliates by piercing Jesse in the chest. The sub starts to take on water, and Jesse gets pinned under a torpedo. David desperately tries to free his father and pleads for Arthur's help, but he refuses to save Jesse because he and his son have killed innocent people. David continues trying to free Jesse, but he knows his time is almost up, and he pulls out a grenade before ordering David to get out and to go kill Arthur. David reluctantly listens and climbs out of the sub as he hears Jesse set off the grenade. Arthur rescues the other Russian crewmen while David gets away in another sub.Arthur joins Thomas as he waits on the docks for Atlanna as he has all these years. The two go to a bar where they see a news report of Aquaman's heroics, and Thomas knows it was his son. He reminds Arthur how he is meant to unite both the surface world and the kingdom of Atlantis. A group of bikers then approach Arthur, seemingly looking for a fight, but they actually just want to take pictures with him.Down in Atlantis, Arthur's half-brother Orm (Patrick Wilson) is with Arthur's mentor Nuidis Vulko (Willem Dafoe) as they prepare to meet with King Nereus of Xebel (Dolph Lundgren). Orm wants Nereus to form an alliance with him in a supposed effort to unite the other kingdoms of the sea, but Orm really wants an excuse to attack the surface world, believing they will strike upon Atlantis first. Nereus is also aware of Arthur's existence, though Orm refuses to acknowledge his half-brother or that his mother lived among the surface dwellers. Just then, a blast hits the area, and a submarine comes in for an attack. Orm and Nereus round up their forces to strike back, and Orm manages to send the sub crashing to the lowest depths of the ocean. Nereus is then convinced to side with Orm as they prepare to send a message to the surface.That evening, Arthur and Thomas are leaving the bar when Arthur is found by Princess Mera (Amber Heard), daughter of Nereus. She warns Arthur that Orm is planning to wage war on the surface, and that the lives of people both on land and sea will be in danger. Arthur doesn't seem interested, even as Mera tells him that Vulko has found a path to the long lost Trident of Atlan, which can be used to defeat Orm and allow Arthur to claim his place as king of Atlantis. Arthur remains unmoved, due to his belief that the Atlanteans executed his mother, but he promises to handle Orm his own way if he does attack.Meanwhile in the North Sea, Orm and his commandos meet with David. Orm hands David his payment (in gold coins), but David wants to get his hands on Aquaman whom he blames for the death of his father.A massive tidal wave heads toward the mainland as Arthur and Thomas are driving home. It strikes their truck and pulls Arthur out. He frantically swims back to his father, but with Mera's help, they are able to get Thomas out of the water and revive him. Arthur looks upon the now devastated land and is convinced to join her to stop Orm.The two head toward a cliff side to dive into the ocean, the same place where Vulko taught Arthur how to swim, master his Atlantean instincts and fight with his mother's sea fork. Arthur and Mera board her watercraft and ride past Atlantis to make it to a sunken ship to meet Vulko. He tells Arthur that the legend of Atlan's trident is real, as it belonged to the founding king Atlan (Graham McTavish) and was forged from powerful steel, designed to allow someone worthy to rule over Atlantis. Back then, Atlantis prospered on the surface and made impressive technological advancements, but their drive for power ultimately brought their downfall, and Atlantis sunk to the bottom of the ocean. However, their advancements also helped Atlanteans evolve and breathe underwater, while others regressed and mutated into monstrosities. Atlan would spend the rest of his life in exile. Vulko provides Arthur and Mera with a cylinder to find the final resting place of Atlan, just before they are attacked by a commando. Arthur and Mera fight them, but another more powerful group led by Murk (Ludi Lin) arrive and capture Arthur.Arthur is brought before Orm so that they can finally meet. Taunting Arthur with the belief that his mother was executed for bearing a child from the surface, Arthur suddenly feels he's to blame for his mother's alleged death. Orm also explains his position and hatred for the surface world due to the harm that they have inflicted upon the oceans. He offers to let Arthur leave and never return, but Arthur challenges him to a duel, his right as an Atlantean. Despite objections from Vulko and Mera, Orm accepts.Arthur gears up for the duel, wielding his mother's sea fork. Meanwhile, Orm gives Mera, his betrothed, a bracelet that he says belonged to Atlanna. A flashback shows Vulko training him to properly use it, even showing him a move that creates a type of water shield. Young Arthur believed that Atlanna abandoned him because she didn't love him or his father, but Vulko told him that she was executed by being fed to the creatures of The Trench.In the present, Arthur heads to the Ring of Fire where the duel commences before an ecstatic crowd of people, most of whom have sided with Orm. Although Arthur puts on a respectable display of force, Orm attempts to drag him down into the lava to kill him. Arthur escapes Orm's clutches, but the evil king uses his trident to destroy Arthur's fork. Mera intervenes and takes Arthur out of the arena before Orm can strike a fatal blow. The two escape in her watercraft and are pursued by Orm's men. Their ship is shot down, but Arthur and Mera escape, although Orm is led to believe that they were killed. The two hide in the mouth of a whale that Arthur summons so that it can take them somewhere safe above the surface.Orm finds out about Arthur and Mera surviving, and he orders his commandos to find them, but Nereus forces Orm to ensure that Mera is brought back safely. Orm then goes to contact David and allows him to lead the commandos to find Arthur and Mera, and he equips David with Atlantean weaponry to ensure that Arthur is killed. David does some personal tweaking to the weapons and suit to his own liking.Arthur and Mera board a plane to take them to the Sahara desert, and they jump out with no parachutes. Mera tells Arthur that the Sahara was once covered by the ocean and they walk until they fall down a hole that brings them to an old temple where Atlan's trident was forged. Mera places the cylinder down on a round platform, but nothing happens until she realizes it must be activated with water. After doing so, it activates a holographic message from Atlan with instructions on how to locate the trident. Arthur then finds a bottle with a map inside that tells them their next stop is in Sicily.Orm meets with the Fisherman King (Djimon Hounsou) in an attempt to get him to join forces, but the King refuses, and Orm kills him in front of his wife and daughter. He then orders them to have their people join him.Arthur and Mera arrive in Sicily where they briefly indulge in the activities among the surface dwellers. They find a spot among the statues of past leaders where they will know where the trident lies. Arthur figures it out by putting the bottle in the hand of a statue of Romulus, according to Atlan's message. When placed there, Arthur and Mera see the direction of the trident's location, which is in the Trench. They are then attacked by David, now calling himself Black Manta, and his commandos. He fires a laser from his helmet at Arthur, while also using weapons that turn water into plasma blasts. Mera takes on the commandos while Arthur battles Manta. She kills off a few and finishes the rest by manipulating red wine and impaling them with it. Arthur manages to send Manta flying and accidentally blasting himself with his own laser before he falls into the ocean.Mera treats Arthur's wounds and the two sail to the Trench. He tells her how he feels responsible for David becoming his enemy after refusing to save his father, as well as his doubts that he is a worthy leader or king. Mera assures him he is wrong and that he is the bridge between man and the sea.Back in Atlantis, Orm is planning his invasion of the surface with his newly united tribes. He finds out that Vulko was working against him and he orders his men to imprison Vulko.As they sail through a storm, Arthur and Mera are attacked by the hideous creatures of the Trench. They fight back, but a huge horde appears, forcing underwater as the ship is destroyed. Just when it looks like they are doomed, they are pulled out of harm's way by a mysterious being who takes them deep into the trench and up into a tropical chamber with breathable air. To Arthur's surprise, it's Atlanna. He embraces his mother for the first time in years. He also tells her how Thomas has been waiting for her to return after all this time. Atlanna tells Arthur and Mera how she escaped her execution and has been stranded in an uncharted sea. She points out to Arthur that the trident is located behind a nearby waterfall, and only the one true king may enter and come out with the trident. She and Mera give Arthur confidence to head on in.Arthur enters and sees the trident glowing on a dais. He suddenly comes face-to-face with Karathen (voice of Julie Andrews), a gigantic monster that guards the trident. She doubts Arthur's worth and tries to attack him, but Arthur then uses his powers to communicate with her, something that only Atlan was also able to do. When Karathen asks Arthur what makes him worthy of wielding the trident, he says he is not worthy, and that he only wants to save both worlds. Karathen is convinced and allows Arthur to take the trident from Atlan's skeleton, giving him greater power and a new suit of gold and green.Orm, now calling himself Ocean Master, and his forces gather to launch their attack on the surface. A climatic battle begins as Arthur and Mera lead their own forces of sea creatures, including Karathen, to fight back and subdue Orm's army. The creatures take out Orm's men, leading the other Atlanteans to renounce their loyalty to him. Orm then fights Arthur once again, only this time, Arthur forces Orm to the surface to fight on his own turf. Arthur utilizes the trident's power to his advantage, and he shatters Orm's trident, leaving him on his knees. Arthur decides to spare Orm's life, even as he demands to be killed, but Atlanna rises from the ocean to greet Orm, and the two embrace. Vulko orders the commandos to arrest Orm, and he goes willingly. Arthur tells Orm that he is willing to talk to him when he is ready. The Atlanteans then accept Arthur as their new king.Thomas goes down to the docks once again, and is surprised to see that Atlanna has finally returned to him. The two embrace and kiss.Arthur concludes with a narration stating how destiny has a way of bringing people together the way it brought his parents together. He has now accepted his position as a son of the land, as a king and protector of the seas as... AQUAMAN.Midway through the credits, David is shown to be alive, and he is found by Stephen Shin (Randall Park), a conspiracy theorist obsessed with Atlantis and Aquaman. When David wakes up, he finds Stephen checking out the Atlantean tech. David offers to show Stephen how it works if he helps him find and kill Arthur/Aquaman.""]"
20,DC Extended Universe,Shazam!,448115,"[""Easy watching, some funny bits. Starts off well but then gets a bit muddled in its ideas and a bit 'seen it all before'. I think the 7/10 is accurate but it a good seven."", ""DC has had a rocky road, but shazam, aka captain marvel was an enjoyable film, silly yet fun, found a good medium, and the villain was great. Can't wait for Black Adam. See it if you just want some fun and nothing serious."", 'Technically a 6.5, but definitely not anything to be thrilled about, as there isn\'t much novelty. I\'m not familiar with the comics so I had no special expectations. I can honestly say it was a fun movie, but I just don\'t see where the glowing praise is coming from.Story-wise, it does its job without much surprise or imagination. The little drama with Billy searching for his long-lost mom, while being unable to accept companionship from others, is alright. The special FX are good, but there aren\'t any mindblowing scenes (no real fighting or magic other than smoke and lightning). I didn\'t mind the villain being one-note, but I wish they did something better than the old ""7 deadly sins,"" or at the very least been more creative with the designs (which look like clay concept models of generic gargoyles and you couldn\'t even tell which sin was which).Maybe I\'m just cynical, but I didn\'t find it very funny. Sure I had a few smirks and chuckles now and then, but there wasn\'t anything roaringly hilarious. If the trailers didn\'t exactly make you LOL, then you\'d probably won\'t within the full movie. The comparisons to a kid-friendly Deadpool are apt, but without the wackiness that ""seals the deal"" as most of the jokes are simple/cheesy/cheap (At the very beginning, Billy steals a cop\'s lunch bag while he pleads against it. Later on he uses his adult form to buy beer and visit a strip club like every teenage boy\'s wishes. That\'s pretty much the bar of humor throughout, besides the numerous ""Look what I can do!"" moments of discovery for the powers.)There\'s a large disconnect between the ever-brooding Billy and the upbeat Shazam, almost like a reverse Jekyll/Hyde. I\'d be pretty stoked too if I suddenly gained superpowers, but neither character is a natural extension. And except for Freddy, everyone is entirely one-dimensional and stereotypical: overly enthusiastic foster parents, the tech-wizard gamer Asian, the sweet 16-type daughter going off to college, bullies, etc. Billy has probably less than 10 minutes shown interacting with the fosters that him eventually accepting them as family is a giant, unsatisfying leap.Overall, it\'s highly forgettable, but kids will enjoy it, assuming they won\'t be affected by the CG monsters.', ""A lot of the DCEU movies are overly dark and gritty but not Shazam, it's bright, colorful, funny, and has a heartfelt story. The film's pacing at times can be a little slow and not all of the jokes land, but overall this is perfect movie to watch with the family."", ""Honestly, i didn't expect this movie to be good but when i finally watched it i changed my mind. Felt entertaining and interesting 👍👍"", ""General Thoughts:The most fun I've had in a superhero movie since...well I was going to say Infinity War but that plotline is not very fun. Point is: this movie is fun. It really feels like it was made for kids, with a sprinkling of adult themes here and there. As someone who is suffering from extreme super hero fatigue, this is an excellent film to enjoy without having to put too much thought into it.The Good:The characters do not feel like they make stupid decisions. Every time I was questioning something that was being done, I could essentially chalk it up to the kids being...well kids. The film treats its children like children in the best way. There is no profound philosophical dialogue coming from the mouth of an eight year old. The film was just plain fun.The Bad:There are some minor continuity errors throughout the film that would not distract most people but if you are thinking about the film-making it may take you out of the film for the briefest of moments. Two examples I can think of are characters swapping their locations very quickly (likely in-between takes), and a character flying through the air faster than a plane with absolutely no wind affecting him or his clothing whatsoever. The movie does make up for this with a comical flight scene near the end of the film which I wont spoil."", '""Shazam!"" is an Action - Fantasy movie in which we watch a young boy gaining some unexpected powers that has to learn how to control them. As he gains experience and learns even better his powers, soon he has to deal with a new powerful enemy.I liked this movie and I found it very interesting and different from other superhero movies that I have watched. The plot of the movie is simple but very interesting and the direction which was made by David F. Sandberg was very good and I believe that he did an excellent job. The interpretations of both Zachary Levi who played as Shazam and Asher Angel who played as Billy Batson were very good and the combination of them created this beautiful result. Finally, I have to say that ""Shazam!"" is a nice, entertaining movie that I highly recommend everyone to watch it.', ""My only previous reference to Shazam! is the 70s morning TV series that Michael Gray and Les Tremayne starred in with two different actor playing the adult Captain Marvel. It was shot on a shoestring budget with Gray and Tremayne wearing the same clothing every episode.No budgetary expense here was spared in Shazam! the movie. We get some background on the teen Billy Batson who is in a group home in Philadelphia and wants to find his parents. He's not a bad kid, but a mischievous one who is the troublemaker for the adults at the home.One fine day he's contacted from an alternate world and given the power of a superhero. Which he's fine with, but not sure how to use. Asher Angel is Billy and the adult superhero he can transform himself to is Zachary Levi. Watching Levi as the adult is like watching Adam Sandler. Maybe the producers tried for Sandler originally.Things go great until he runs into a super villain Mark Strong. It seems back in the day when Strong was a kid he entered the same realm, but was rejected. Now he's back having aligned himself with demon forces.Shazam! for all its technical wizardry is a show for kids of all ages. By the way no name for the superhero is decided so you will not hear Captain Marvel.That comes in a sequel I'm sure."", 'The movie have some good moments with some very well made visual effects. I enjoyed it but thats it. The movie have a classic line story and dont have any surprise or big revelation. Still entertaining with some good jokes but thats all.', 'SummaryThis film about the myth of origin and the learning story of a superhero who recovers the playful spirit of the youth films of the 80s, thanks to a comedy tone that always prevails over the shadows of the story, the great chemistry between its protagonists and its troops action scenes.Review:Billy Batson (Asher Angel), is a teenager who since childhood has been escaping from their transit homes and foster families to find his mother. Shortly after starting to live in Philadelphia with the last one, he fortuitously acquires super powers and an adult body (Zachary Levi), falling into the crosshairs of a fearsome villain, Dr. Sivana (Mark Strong).Shazam! It recovers a certain spirit of the youth films of the 80s thanks to its playful spirit. It is a story about the origin myth of a superhero (and also of his nemesis) and his learning path in a comedy tone that, although it does not evade the rugged or sad aspects of the family stories of Batson and Sivana, never let them take center stage by overshadowing the tone, cutting them off with effective touches of humor (a bit in the manner of Tim Burton\'s Batman Returns). Fortunately, by not making concessions in this regard, the film directed by David F. Sandberg departs from the gravity and solemnity of many superhero films of the last decades. And the humor that he displays is not cool or self-conscious either.In addition to the enmity and struggles with Dr. Sivana, the other (and perhaps main) axis of the film is Billy\'s friendship with Freddy (Jack Dylan Glazer, the protagonist of the series We Are Who We Are, de Luca Guadagnino), one of his ""brothers"" in the transit home, who accompanies him in his apprenticeship as a superhero. Precisely the most interesting and successful part of the film is the description of that bond, of a double dynamic for Freddy since it implies being a friend of the same person who can manifest himself as someone of the same age and as someone in an adult body and not so much the mismatches that Billy himself has with his new and extraordinary situation. You can even read the occasional provocative subtext in those situations.The action scenes and special effects are very well resolved and in keeping with the tone of the film, the pace does not falter and the performances are very good, particularly that of the brilliant Jack Dylan Glazer, whose character breathes and articulates the humanity of the whole story.', 'So I finally decided to give this a go and I have to say, I\'m a little annoyed I waited this long, because it\'s a very fun film.So what put me off initially was that from the trailer it seemed a bit too silly and childish and I\'m not too fond of that humour. But I have to say it was done very well and I didn\'t find it daft at all.So as my title says, I did find the film I little predictable. You could see what direction the film was heading in early doors and it never really veered from that path. I felt like it was just missing that ""wow"" factor to break this movie into 8/10 and beyond. It was very down the middle lane kind of film, which don\'t get me wrong there\'s nothing wrong with that. But I just wanted a little more.Sticking with the plot theme. It kept me entertained throughout and I remained interested for the entire 2 hours or so. So clearly it did something right! My only negative on this subject was that I thought they expanded in the wrong areas. So the first 45 mins or so was developing the characters so we didn\'t even see ""Shazam"" until 45 mins in. Then it sort of whizzed through the \'dealing with the idea he has powers\' phase and went straight into the overly long end sequence. I feel like they could have done more with the mid section and even shortened the beginning and end to do so.Beyond that though I thought the characters were great and they were all likeable and the arcs were also fun and interesting to get stuck in. And overall it was just enjoyable and a fun watch. It does what you expect it to do! The humour isn\'t over the top, stupid nor overdone and it\'s not complicated either. Yeah I\'d recommend this if you\'re debating it. It\'s enjoyable!', ""I got to see an early screening of Shazam! at my local theater, and boy did it not disappoint. It's not flawless, but the good outweighs the bad more often than not. With a bright story, boundless energy, and an irresistible sense of fun, this is certainly one of the best-if not the best-installment of the DCEU so far.Direction: I feel like David Samberg is the DCEU's Taika Waititi. He's this movie director that really isn't known for much past some horror, which made him an initially odd choice for this movie; a choice that paid off tremendously. He helps some light shine into this world, but doesn't underplay the action. His direction and coordination through framing helps us laugh and, in some cases, feel the punches. The action isn't jolty like the other DCEU installments and due to the bright vibrant colors, we really know what's happening, where it's happening, and who it's happening to. Well done.The writing was uneven, but definitely fun. It's a basic story that converts Billy Batson's origin into a modern-day retelling with some elements of Big in there. The humor is well-timed and consistently funny; a lot of meta jokes and inner humor help the story obtain its brighter feel. The relationships written in are heartfelt and the story itself has a lot of heart. One part that causes a rift is the central character of Billy. His two versions, between the adult and the kid, seem to be two completely different people. It's an inconsistency that's fine being just about the only part (besides typical villain problems) that bugs you about the writing.Performances: I swear, Zachary Levi was born to play Shazam! He carries childlike enthusiasm and a heart in effortlessly. He oozes charisma and really... I won't be able to say it enough so here it is: Zachary Levi is perfection. The rest... Kid Billy was somewhat toned down but still played quite nicely. Mark Strong played a menacing villain. The child actors, especially Jack Dylan Fraiser (Grazer? I'm sorry I don't remember off the top of my head), were VERY good. Child actors really are improving. Any other supporting performance was played nicely and everyone knew who the real star of the movie was: I'm sorry, I'm gonna keep coming back to this: Zachary Levi is a national treasure.What else... music was nice and heartfelt, I talked about the action sequences... every other part of this film is mainly there to add to Billy's story and I like it. The world is undeniably fun and we're not really pulled out of it.The future is bright for the DCEU with chapters like Shazam! (9/10)"", ""It was pretty much exactly what I expected which is a really enjoyable and lighthearted superhero film with some funny moments and that will be enough for most people but it just didn't blow me away. No way this is a 10 like some are suggesting and to nitpick, adult Billy acts nothing like young Billy at all. Don't get me wrong - its still a fun movie which I can recommend."", ""I've seen some reviews before and this movie was supposed to be somehow good. It really was just meh. But i think for children (even though there were some questionable hard scenes) it could be something nice. Also the after credit scene was probably more hilarious than the actual movie."", ""This film loaded with silly humour, but it actually got some clever laughs and its heart is in the right place. When I say that this film has its heart in the right place I mean that it manages to get the balance of comedy and sentimentality without crossing too far over the line into cheesiness. Billy's story involves him not being happy in his foster home and trying to search for his mum. I felt sad for Billy. However, the way we get to know his new foster family, with all their individual quirks, shows us that he's in a safe and loving environment with genuinely good people. It's nice. When it comes to the superhero stuff I think this film manages to do well at demonstrating action scenes via the use of amazing visual effects. Perhaps near the end the film turned into something we've seen many times before, but it looked good while it was happening. The performances really carry this movie; Zachary Levi suited the role. Because he is actually playing a 14 year old boy he has to portray that convincingly - which he does with ease. He's really funny, and also looked suited to the action stuff as well. But one issue is that, the personalities between the adult and young Billy doesn't match, Zachary Levi is more convincing that's he's a 14 year old boy than younger Billy is. He come as across as very childish as an adult than he is a 14 year old. I hope they correct that in the sequel. Jack Dylan Grazer is pure comedy throughout this movie. His mannerisms are just as impressive as the words coming out of his mouth. He, which was a true supporting performance. Few minor issues i had with the movie is that the villain was too weak and the film did felt slightly too long. In the latter stages when the comedy was lessened and the serious stuff took over I did feel the film begin to lose its identity. The quirky comic superhero film was starting to look like all the others. I know they have to have the big battle between the hero and villain; but it almost lost me when all that stared. All in all, Shazam is an enjoyable film with some positive morals going on. It has a lots of charms and a fine balance between humor and seriousness."", ""It's a slow build up, so stick through the boring slowness. Cause it gets better at the end. It was very heartwarming to watch the character development and seeing how it ended."", 'Finally, the DC Comics franchise managed to inject some humor into one of their super-hero projects. A lot of it works, though the story line is merely so-so, as the target audience appears to be well below the age of the average DC based film which is darker in tone. With that in mind, it probably would have been a good idea to temper some of the language to make it an all around, better family friendly picture. I didn\'t care much for the character of young Billy Batson (Asher Angel), his personality didn\'t seem right to be selected as the \'chosen one\'. I actually liked his foster brother Freddy (Jack Dylan Grazer) better; he seemed to have some of the qualities, and even the looks of the young Fred Savage in ""The Wonder Years"" television program. It probably comes as no surprise that the release of this picture around the same time as ""Captain Marvel"" would confuse comic book fans who thought both Captain Marvel and Shazam were one and the same character. It even had be puzzled for a while when the titles were announced, but changing story lines, ethnicity and genders is nothing new for comic book writers looking to push the envelope on transforming existing characters. The picture is pretty well balanced between the comedic aspects of the players and the threat posed by the evil Dr. Sivana (Mark Strong) and his Seven Deadly Sin allies. The foster home setting at the center of the story was a good one to demonstrate how kids in that kind of environment can learn to overcome their circumstances and achieve personal goals and fulfillment; in that regard, teenage Mary (Grace Fulton) was a perfectly good role model. I don\'t know that this film would lead to an even more effective sequel, though one of the credits scenes hinted as much. I did like the final scene after all the credits rolled in which an in joke was leveled at Aquaman\'s expense, and the final clip in the movie proper ended things on a high note with the appearance of a faceless Superman. When the film makers follow up on this one, it would be a good idea to maintain the same sense of fun this one had.', ""Superhero this, superhero that. Someone gets super powers and ends up fighting an evil version of themselves with similar abilities. If you've seen one (recent) superhero movie then you've probably seen them all and it gets to the stage where you start to wonder if there's anything new a film company can bring to the genre. I'm pleased to say that, despite following most superhero cliches, 'Shazam!' has enough going for it to make it definitely worth a watch.Ignoring the fact that it was originally meant to be part of the (possibly now deceased?) 'DC Shared Universe' (remember 'Batman vs Superman, Suicide Squad' and all that?) you don't really need to know much about any other film to 'get' what's going on here. A young boy attains magical powers from a wizard (as you do) and, every time he says the magic word ('Shazam!' just in case you hadn't guessed), he's changed from a weedy fifteen year old high school lad to a spandex-clad muscular hunk.Now, if you've been following what was supposed to be DC's attempt at a 'shared universe' you'll know that they tried to make themselves different from Marvel by being 'darker' and 'grittier.' Well, 'Shazam!' isn't like that at all. It actually feels a bit like one of those 'family' movies from the eighties, as if it's part of a 'Goonies' shared universe than the 'Man of Steel.'Having a child as the star can always be a bit hit and miss, however Asher Angel actually pulls it off and is quite believable in the role, even before he transfers leading man duties to Zachary Levi for the 'superhero moments.' We have veteran actor Mark Strong as the baddie who has the previously-mentioned 'similar powers' as Shazam. He's naturally a good actor, therefore he plays the part well. However, just like the light-hearted tone of the film emulates Marvel's output, so does the lack of real development and motivation for the villain.There's plenty of laughs and a great use of Queen's 'Don't Stop Me Now' (possibly even better than 'Shaun of the Dead' used it), however, for those of us who noticed, the computer-effects are a bit ropy and probably could have been a little more polished. But that's just a minor gripe. Ultimately, I reckon youngsters should enjoy this film and not notice the - slightly in-your-face - message about 'family,' choosing instead to simply go along for the ride. For the adults, there's plenty of mocking of superhero movies and it's quite fun to picture this film in the same world where Batman and Superman have become marketable brands.It may not be the greatest superhero movie of our time (and certainly not the most original), but it nicely crossed the divide between a film for adults and kids and if you're in the mood for something light and fluffy after the darker 'Infinity War/Endgame' pairing, then you can happily lose yourself in a world of magic and wizards for a couple of hours."", ""Shazam! was light, funny and simple. It was actually pretty much what you expect from a super hero movie : the tragic past, the super villain, the transformation, the built up and the final great battle. However, what this movie had extra was the comedy factor, the teenager's theme and a more heartly story, all of which can't be easily found in the nowdays superhero movies that focus on the action and visuals rather than the actual story."", 'A different film from the usually gloomy DC movies, he manages to combine a family-friendly comedy with a superhero fighting against the seven deadly sins, although most of the comedy is given by the fact that the superhero is a child in the body of a adult. As a film in general it is constructive and very beautiful plot because it follows the growth of the protagonist, but maybe, there is too much comedy that sometimes stunned in a superhero movie.', 'The DC Universe has been a mess since day one.What with one facial expression Cavill and him slapping the fans in the face bailing. Affleck\'s solo movie being on hold and then him slapping the fans in the face bailing. Them rushing into Justice League without establishing the characters. All the drama around Suicide Squad with Leto after the editor got a bit over zealous. And of course the inconsistent tone and just underwhelming quality.Shazam looked promising, but was it really a good idea for them to go further away from the dark tone people are used to? And is ""Shazam"" really a character that can carry the franchise on his back now Batman and Superman have gone walkies?Truth be told I liked the trailer, but only in the sense that I didn\'t view it as a DCU movie. It looked like a fun family film and I was fairly looking forward to it, I did however think it would be predictable Hollywood stuff and the trailer is basically the entire film compressed.Well, I was right. It\'s exactly that, but it\'s also an enjoyable enough little take your brain out movie.Levi is great as our lead, Strong hams it up suitably as our villain and the supporting cast (Mostly kids) do a passable enough job. The movie is big, flashy and exactly what you\'d expect if you saw the trailer.So it\'s fun, it is but it\'s not without its flaws. It\'s tacky, badly so in places whereas in others the CGI makes me think that somebody overpaid the SFX team by a tremendous amount. Then you have the plot and the general delivery which is basically exactly what you\'d expect with absolutely no surprises. It\'s a Hollywood film, and as usual they play it very safe and by the numbers.In my opinion this has done the DC Universe absolutely no favors, this isn\'t a character that will save the franchise and I still believe they need a miracle to turn things around.Regardless it\'s fun dumb stuff and a perfectly passable little film.The Good:Great laughsAt least John Cena never got the lead role *Shudders*A fair bit of funThe Bad:Some sfx are unforgivably ropeyGeneric, tacky, Hollywood stuffAsher Angel looks like Maisie Williams, seriously it oddly confused me throughout the film', 'Good movie You can watch it with your family Good comedy If you have time i 100% recommend you to watch it', ""I watched it with my 12 and 14 year old and paid a princely sum to watch it at the cinema.There is something very wrong with DC.It's really gone downhill since Suicide Squad.Poor CGI, 80s plotting, 1 dimensional bad guys, no real sense of danger and terrible dialogue.The thing is DC do have some interesting ideas to work with. A disparate bunch of anti heroes group together (Suicide Squad), a female superhero who completely takes the reins (Wonder Woman) and now a kid who becomes a superhero. The ideas are really interesting, it's in the execution of the ideas that it all fails.All the recent scripts are the same really. All end up with this OTT (and yawn inducing) Big Boss fight off.Shazam is fun in parts. The first act is really over drawn but things improve significantly once Shazam enters the frame. And that middle act is fun. Full of jokes and humour but then we get to the third act and it reverts to type.That last act is cringe worthy (something my children told me). No real sense of peril or danger and the CGI doesn't help.Honestly, not sure why people are posting 10s for this. It ain't The Godfather or Toy story. It's just another run of the mill 80s type plot with mediocre to poor CGI with some decent jokes.Save your cinema ticket for something better and catch this on Tv whenever it comes out. You will thank me.You could argue that it's just silly fun. Yes, if the film were just the middle act but unfortunately you have to sit through the final third for zero pay off.For the time being, don't bother."", ""If this was the potential of DCEU, why on earth movies like Justice League, BvS and Suicide Squad even exist? The more I watch films like this, the more I think Snyder was the biggest mistake of DCEU.Good : Zachary Levi is awesome as the adult version of Billy Batson. He can perfectly play an adult who is actually a teenager. His performance is incredible. He has an amazing chemistry with all the other characters which made the experience really good. The movie is an ultimate fun ride from the top to bottom. There's not a single part which felt boring or uninteresting. The arc given to Billy was quite good and we start to like the characters. The comedic parts deliver at its finest. Director Sandberg has shown versatility in a very good way. I have always thought of him as a very good director. His horror films like Lights Out and Annabelle Creation are directed quite well, the major flaws are in the script, if any. Here, there are no such problems with the script, and he understands very well how a certain part of the story is to be directed. Some parts do have a nice horror movie vibe to it, but it is not tonally inconsistent. It knows what it tries to be, and doesn't take itself too seriously. Even at the times it does, it is for a comedic purpose. It never tries to be an epic film knowing that it's not, unlike BvS. It is sure to put a smile on your face throughout and make you laugh a lot. The final moments are crowd pleasing moments done right.Mixed : It's not a big problem, but I expected more comedy out of this. What I got was great, but I wanted a lot more of funny stuff. The kid playing teen Billy Batson isn't a bad actor. But some of the times, it felt like him and Levi were a little different with each other. It could've been a little better.Bad : The villain was a clichéd villain. He wasn't interesting as a character like Thanos, Ledger's Joker or Bane. Mark Strong does a good job, but this is a poorly written villain.Conclusion : An entertaining superhero film which knows what it is, and is quite campy in a good way. It is not wildly original concept of a film. It has some popular tropes of the genre and has a familiar template for an origin story. But it will definitely keep you entertained till the end, and you will end up liking most of the characters. The best thing is, even if you have never seen a DCEU movie, it won't make a difference. It has little to no reference to the previous DCEU films and is its own thing for the most part. Recommended even to those who are not the fan of the genre.Rating.Score : 7.8/10Grade : A-"", ""The idea of the film is essentially copied/plagiarized from Tom Hanks's 1988 hit Big, but is much worse in every possible way. The visual effects are cheap and lousy. Levi's performance is a disaster. The tones of the young Billy and the grownup Billy are not consistent. The buildup is too long, and the plot lacks credibility. The result is a mindless comedy that is neither funny nor with heart."", 'In Winter 1974. a young Thaddeus Sivana and his older brother are driven home by their father. While playing with his magic 8 ball, Sivana is magically transported to the Rock of Eternity, where he meets a wizard, who introduced him to the mystical statues containing the spirits of the Seven Deadly Sins: Pride, Greed, Lust, Envy, Gluttony, Wrath, and Sloth. The last of a council of 7, the wizard spent centuries searching for a new champion. Put to a test to see if he is pure of heart, Sivana attempts to touch the eye of envy, failing the test. Transported back to the car, he causes a scene in which his brother hits him, and his father to crash on ice, injured. The magic 8 ball reads ""find me"".A few years before modern day, Billy is at a carnival with his mother, who plays darts in vain to get a tiger. Afterwards, Billy loses a pendant ball he has and chases after it, separating from his mother. Lost, he is picked up by police who gets him to a foster home.In present day Philadelphia, Billy Batson lures and traps police officers into a pawn shop, using their computer in hopes of searching the address of his long lost mother. Traveling, he is disappointed. He is found and brought to a social services worker who puts him with the Vasqueze family, and the other siblings, Eugene, Darla, Pedro, Mary and Freddy.In the office building of Sivana Industries, a woman tells a doctor about her experience and shares a video. Sivana takes the video to his office where he had a project that tracked people who had similar sightings around the word, and the video enabled him to find access to the wizard\'s lair. When questioned about it, Sivana turns the doctor into dust. He uses the symbols to access the lair, confronts the wizard, and touches the energy ball by Enzy, unleashing the Seven Deadly Sins. They form into an eye and sits at home and latches itself into his right eye.At school, the foster children shows Billy around the school, as he adjusts. At lunch Freddie sits with Billy and after trying to pester him for a few minutes in attempts to get him to known him better. Outside, bullies drive him and hit Freddie. Billy stands up to the bullies and hits them with Freddie\'s walking stick, and runs into the subway to avoid them. While on the train, symbols appear and he enters the Rock of Eternity. The wizard reveals he had previously given his to someone else, but had turned evil and killed numerous people and released the seven deadly sins. The wizard vowed to search for someone who possessed a pure of heart, leading him to search for millennia. He chooses Billy, who has to say the word Shazam. Billy says the word, and transforms into the champion Shazam, and the wizard disappears. Shazam returns to Philadelphia and returns to the foster home and meets with Freddie. Testing all the abilities, lightning, super speed, and strength. They enter a store and stop an armed robbery. Heading home, he discovers he reverts to his other form by saying Shazam.At Sivana industries, Dr Sivana barges into a corporate meeting hosted by his brother and father, who had lost his legs in the accident from the night in 1974. A confrontation between the siblings results in Sivana throwing his brother out of the window and showing off the sins in his eyes, slaughtering everyone in the room, including his father.Freddie posts videos of Shazam\'s powers, going viral. Freddie and Billy are in school and skip school when Billy poses as Shazam to check them out. Leaving, they get around to test fire immunity, flight, and strength. Happy, they walk through a mall where they use the lightning ability to charge people\'s cell phones, get sodas for free, attempt to purchase a lair from a real estate agent, and going to a strip club. He comes out and says we need more money. They go to an ATM, zapping it and taking some of the money, using it to purchase merchandise.Next day at school - the bullies begin to mess with Freddie and Billy again until Freddie tells them he knows the new hero ""Red Cyclone"" - they don\'t believe him but he promises and tells them that he\'ll get him to show up to lunch tomorrow. Freddie and Billy get into a bit of an argument over him just assuming and trying to use Billy for his powers. That night at dinner the father asks the family what they think of the new hero - everyone gives input and Freddie takes a dig at Shazam and then him and Billy get into a bit of an argument leaving the rest of the family confused.At school the next day, Billy decides not to attend school because he wants to find his mother, despite Freddie asking for lunch. Shazam does various things, taking selfies, and showing off lightning for money. He sees and saves Mary from being hit by a car, and talking to her makes him realize she is upset that, because of college, she will have to leave her family. Shazam accidentally reveals he knew her name and housing situation, but leaves. Freddie finds Shazam and tries to talk to him, yet Shazam tries to diffuse it, shooting lighting that hits the tires of a bus across the city, sending it off the side of the bridge. Catching it, Shazam puts it on the concrete, only to be promptly told he\'s not using his powers right. Hearing the commotion, Dr. Sivana shows up and demands the powers that Shazam possesses. Brushing him off, Shazam is promptly thrown around and lands through a mall, while discovering his ability to fly. Sivana hunts him down, but Shazam transforms back into Billy and runs. Freddie is there and is taken hostage by Sivana, who demands to be taken to Billy.Billy shows up, and they know with Eugene telling him where his mother is; she is only 2 subway stops away. Billy rushes out of his house, with his foster parents in tow. Back at the house, Sivana shows up with Freddie and traps the children. Billy arrives at his mother\'s apartment complex. His mother informs Billy he was intentionally abandoned on that day, and saw him with the police and that he would be better cared for by others since she was 17. Controlling his emotions in the face of the heartbreaking reality that his stubborn years-long search for his mother was for nothing, Billy quietly reassures his mother that he is fine, but he has to return to his real family. However, Billy gives his mother the key-chain compass she gave him years ago with a comment mixed with regret, resentment and understanding about her, ""You might need it more than me."" Leaving, he receives a call and Sivana tells him to come home. Billy jumps off the apartment building and transforms to Shazam and flies home.Shazam decides to give up the power to save his family and Sivana opens a magical door to the Rock of Eternity. Taking the wizard\'s staff, Sivana unleashes the 7 deadly sins. The siblings enter the cave and distract Sivana long enough for them to run and exit into a winter carnival.Sivana and the sins attack the Carnival, shooting at a Ferris wheel, almost tipping over. Sivana and Shazam fight all around the carnival. Getting a hold of the wizard\'s stick, Shazam and his family, yell his name, and transmits his power to his family, transforming them into the Shazam family, each an adult superhero. Each fighting one sin, Shazam engages with Sivana while flying through skyscrapers.As it goes to tip over - Freddie flies in and saves the last two people on it - the bullies. Shazam and Sivana end up on a rooftop and Shazam goads the one deadly sin who remained -- Envy. It rips itself out from Sivana\'s eye and Shazam yells Shazam, hurting it. Sivana is knocked off the roof, now mortal. Shazam grabs Sivana and drags him to the carnival, ripping the magical eye out. Saving the day, the Shazam family basks in the cheers of the crowd, takes the eye back to the lair, and return the sins for keeping. Shazam and Freddie decide this is their lair. Back at the foster home, everyone returned to their original form and are watching a news cast of the carnival instance, with Santa Claus describing the event. The foster family all talk and laugh and Billy finally feels happy and safe accepting a family.At school, Freddie sits down at lunch and the entire table leaves so all his siblings come and sit next to him. The bullies show up and ask if he\'s still friends with Red Cyclone - Shazam shows up and tells the school how Freddie showed him everything it means to be a hero and that he also brought another friend - Superman. In the mid-credits scene, Sivana in a prison cell doodling the symbols all over the wall in a futile effort to reopen the portal until he\'s interrupted by the alien caterpillar, Mister Mind, who tells him of the pillars of evil that will come together.In the post credits scene, Shazam tries to talk to fish a la Aquaman.']"
21,DC Extended Universe,Birds of Prey,7713068,"[""To simply put it without wasting time unlike my wasted time watching this garbage, Birds of Prey And ....etc is a chance completely wasted! Should have been, Harley Quinn (add any lame title here), There is No notable presence of Birds of Prey here. The film is How Harley Quinn stood against a G version of Black Mask.The plot story and the directing is a true to heart chick flick and clearly influenced by the feminist movement. The script emphasizing blindly on discriminating against men by depecting all male characters either G, B or if straight then in evil and traitorous manner! The female on the other hand are represented is sadly based on race not on the relation to the comics character nor the fans desire, which is clearly a method of trying to tastelessly involve everyone that no one feels left out! I.e., the choice of Cassandra Cain over Barbra Gordon.This is not the whole disaster but the main problem in my opinion starts from the process of casting...I will never stop believing that Margot Robbie is a very bad representation of Harley Quinn, starting with the looks which is way off, as Margot does not look at all as Harley to the fact that she does not feel or sound like our beloved Animated Harley, least to say how different Arleen Sorkin says Mr. J or Puddin' with a nerdy yet playful way and how Margot fails to represent that. Not to mention the ridiculous child size mallet they gave her in this movie.Did the suits behind the film forgot that Harley is a clown to being with? Where is the Clown in the cinematic version?? We only see a crazed emo girl in nowadays Harley...a disfigured version of our fav. Female clown which faded away.I believe the main reason why many fans like Margot in the first place is mainly because they did not see anyone else play the role on a big screen yet, not because Margot is a good actress or can represent Harley well...like the Jack Nicholson experience with the Joker which people thought he was the best then came Mark Hamill, Heath ledger and lately Joaquin Phoenix.The scenes decorations feels like it was designed by a crazed extravagant fashion designer and the fighting scenes along with the directing is obviously all over the place in a disastrous manner."", ""I'm glad I had my phone, the first half of the film was so boring, the second part was less boring, but still not great. Margot Robbie is good in the role, and she has some great fight scenes, the trouble is that the remainder of the film is so tedious. Good visuals, the trouble is the core of the film simply isn't there to make anything meaningful.Ewan McGregor was wasted, isn't there a better role for him out there somewhere??? Surely???? He was a dreadful antagonist, not his capabilities, but the character, did they intentionally make him lifeless?I can't help but compare it to The Joker, it doesn't compare favourably. It looked good in the trailers, but they literally showed all of the action scenes.I was expecting to be entertained, but in truth I was bored, and judging by others sat next to me yawning, so were others. 3/10"", ""The latest DC Comics superhero movie and once again it's rather generic and forgettable in tone. The action in this one is okay but the comedy is very poor and Harley Quinn herself is best in small doses, so making her the lead character is a bizarre choice. The deliberately adult tone just means constant swearing shoehorned into the script while Ewan McGregor's bad guy is as bland as they come. It's better than GUNPOWDER MILKSHAKE thanks to a couple of halfway decent action scenes and creatively quirky moments, but the rest is merely so-so."", 'Only Margot Robbie saves herself from this rubbish. I wanted to like this film and I ended up hating it. Awful.', 'I liked it. It was entertaining and that\'s what I wanted for a film. I do get why people are whining about the ""men are bad"" agenda, but meh. Just didn\'t bother me in all honesty. Plot: little loose here and there. But it was interesting and kept me entertained. Didn\'t particularly like the detective character, but the others were great. Overall I liked it.', 'Probably the worse movie of all time. Definitely the worse DC movie that has ever been made. Someone decided to ""try"" and make a DC version of Deadpool with Harley Quinn in the lead. This was a bad decision since you can see that the screen writer did not understand the comedic part of Deadpool and could not find the proper lines and scenes to match. Robbie is also awful trying to give a comedic performance - her performance is so bland and lifeless that it is embarrassing. The supporting cast is beyond idiotic. The writer destroyed Huntress and Black Canary and instead of making them nice strong characters she made them a mockery with terrible performances and dialogue. Avoid is garbage at all cost - wipe it off of your windshield for what it really is.', ""Birds of Prey: and the Fantabulous Emancipation of one Harley Quinn, is a movie I had high hopes for but it fell flat. I will start off this review with the positive aspects first such as: Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn was a great casting and continues to be where I think she gives a better performance then her one in Suicide Squad, and Ewan Mcgregor plays a decent version of Black Mask. The use of colours and costumes I thought were great and I found some moments of entertainment through some of its action sequences.However, This film has a lot of problems, most of the performances in this film are very shoddy, especially from Rosie Perez who is a walking cliche' as Renee Montoya (and I know that's what they were going for but it just doesn't work}, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Huntress who gives us some very cringey at times acting, and I think some of this has something to do with the screenplay which I also think is average at best. The humour that they're going for doesn't work at all I chuckled maybe once, and it was the same for my theatre. They also butchered Victor Zsasz which I found extremely disappointing as I was looking forward to his inclusion in the DCEU, the way he was portrayed was nothing like how he is in the comics and it seems like he is just trying to be some knock off version of the Joker. Also why is the film titled Birds of Prey? This is a Harley Quinn Movie, just like the trailers the Birds of Prey are barely in it and when they were they had small glimpses of being cool characters but for the most part they were some of the most cliched early 2000's era superhero characters I have seen since that era.Overall, I found Birds of Prey to be a disappointment I came into this film very optimistic but got let down, due to the fact that this films writing was just plain bad. If Margot Robbie's and Ewan Mcgregor's performances weren't as great as what they were with the nice compliments of the characters costumes it would have been completely boring and cliched garbage."", 'If you are not driven by the imperative need of understanding precisely what is happening in your movie, you might enjoy this psychedelic mix of disjointed cool visuals, great music, firecrackers, fragments of good acting... Birds Of Prey is a mess presented in a messy way, it hardly holds together as a story but it offers moments of fun.', ""I was captured to watch this in part from the DVD cover, and in part from the potential in the story. It started out as an introductory flat 2-D cheap Saturday morning cartoon intro to our main character. That was pretty snoozy but I kept waiting and waiting and ... until I noticed my brain alertness level was somewhere between watching grass grow & deep sleep. Summation: 1. Movie is suppose to be a superhero team spoof, but so shallow flat I actually ended up not caring - just waiting for it to end. 2. 50% of screen time is like a fashion show catwalk of Robbie & her sometimes being cute by staring at the camera; just dumb & boring. Another 25% was showcasing how non-conforming her character could be which did not come across as real - actually it was comic book real. 3. Action scenes were 90% very poorly executed flying kicks & arm takedowns that a 10 year old could perform better. 4. Both dialogue & music lyrics were heavy on the obscenities; a cheap way to fake toughness. 5. Only positive, about 30 seconds worth, was Jurnee Smollett-Bell's singing a classic song."", ""I thought that this was going to be Suicide Squad II but it turns out that it happens to be completely different. The main reason I thought that was because it was clear that Harley Quinn was the main character. Well, that is certainly true, but I also thought that she was also a member of the Birds of Prey, which happens to be another group of super heroes. Well, that turns out not to be the case either, which certainly shows you how much I know about the superhero worlds beyond what I see in the films.Well, this is an origin story, and the name sort of should indicate who the origin story refers to, though as I mentioned Harley Quinn also plays a major role. That is because in this story she and the Joker have split up, and because she is no longer the Joker's girlfriend, all of the people whom she has upset have decided to enact revenge.In a way the plot doesn't seem to be all that coherent, namely because it is jumping all over the place, though this does have a lot to do with Quinn actually telling the story. There also seems to be this thing about a diamond that has been stolen, as well as some woman, the Huntress, AKA the crossbow killer, seeking revenge against the people who killed her family. Obviously they all end up together to fight against the major bad guy.I can sort of see why some people didn't like it because there is a claim that this is basically an anti-male film - in the same way that they responded against Captain Marvel. However, the issues that the film explores are actually quite relevent, namely that there are situations where somebody will take the credit for the work others have done. It just happens that the characters that this happens to in this film all happen to be female, but that shouldn't surprise us when we are dealing with a film in which all the main characters happen to be female.The thing is that if we have situations where the protagonists and antagonists are all male, then there isn't a peep, however because we have a situation where the protagonists are female, and the antagonists are male, then of course there is a reaction against it, yet if we consider a lot of these films we will notice that there is a rection against it. Of course, being the Joker's girlfriend, one sort of wanders why Harley Quinn isn't the antagonist, but is rather an anti-hero.Still, I did find that this film was rather bland, and unexciting. It certainly was no where near as good as some of the other films that have been released in this universe, and honestly, even with the previews I really wasn't captured."", 'This movie has a single objective: to hate men. There\'s literally no other reason this movie exists. No male character is remotely good in the end, they\'re all backstabbing rapists and psychopaths while even the criminal women are all sympathetic to the extreme. So, fine. That\'s its ultimate theme, but what about how the movie tells its story? Well, let\'s judge it purely on that, never mind its rampant misandry. It\'s, um, it\'s terrible.So, the movie is sort of told from Harley Quinn\'s perspective. We regularly see things that she never sees or could know about, commenting on it like she is seeing it. I suppose it\'s supposed to be like a Deadpool fourth wall breaking central character running commentary, but Deadpool was, you know, funny. Quinn really isn\'t, but that\'s not the biggest problem with how the movie is built. The biggest problem is that the first half or so is intentionally poorly built. Quinn is telling the story like she\'s drunk and can\'t remember things in the right order. It reminds me of the Treehouse of Horror from The Simpsons where Homer was telling a ghost story out of order, undercutting every scare he was trying to pull off. There\'s a reason structure is important in storytelling, and it\'s not because it\'s the rules. It\'s because structure provides the base on which audiences stand and understand the characters, plot, and theme of the film. Screwing with structure like this, where Harley constantly backtracks to cover information we should already have, preventing the story from flowing forward, ends up creating a frustrating, at best, experience.So, digging through the back and forth that prevents any solid grounding, Harley Quinn has broken up with the Joker, and she\'s struggling. She goes to Black Mask\'s club and wreaks havoc, letting them all think she\'s still Joker\'s girl. When she decides, in a drunken moment, to blow up Ace Chemical, where both she and the Joker got their palish hue, everyone in the world instantly recognizes it as Joker having dumped Harley, because of course? I mean, the second the police character, Renee Montoya, shows up at the scene, she instantly says that this obviously means that they broke up based on the necklace with a J on it found near the scene. Okay, whatever.This action gets all of Gotham to go after Harley, having made so many enemies over the years, and here\'s where the movie\'s problems with structure are most acute. You see, we\'ve seen some of what Harley has done to anger the underbelly of Gotham against her, mostly her jumping on Black Mask\'s driver\'s legs and breaking them, but the driver wasn\'t terribly distinctive and then none of the other people who show up have ever been seen before. The way they appear feel like they\'re supposed to be comedic appearances, ""OH! That guy!"" sort of responses, but the movie has to completely stop to explain who the person is and why they\'re angry. The kind of introduction the movie does for all of them with a freeze frame and quick text with some quick flashback (which they did in Suicide Squad to terrible effect, by the way) is what you do when you start piling up the grievances as a joke, not how you introduce them all from the beginning. The kicker is that the guy we do know, the driver, is not even the first introduced or even that recognizable.So, alongside this is the actual plot which is that Black Mask is looking for a diamond with bank information laser etched into it that had belonged to a Mafia don who had died a dozen years ago in a hit. How this diamond is eventually found is unclear, but Black Mask sends his new driver, Black Canary the former lounge singer at his club that he elevated to his driver for not terribly good reasons (she beat up some customers that were trying to steal Harley Quinn which would make her a good driver because...?) and Victor Zsasz to recover it from an importer. As Zsasz waits for Canary to return with the car, a young pickpocket, Cassandra, easily takes it from him and gets immediately arrested for having stolen other stuff (with a squad car instantly in support because...?). Black Mask needs that diamond that Cassandra swallows. At the same time, Black Mask\'s men pick up Harley Quinn, and Black Mask is gonna relieve some stress by cutting of her face. However, she...manages to talk him into letting her find the diamond because...she has no actual skills in finding things other than some weird story about a picture of naked Eleanor Roosevelt that had belonged to the Joker? And then he immediately just puts out a $500,000 bounty on Cassandra for anyone to collect anyway? What? This is dumb. This is really dumb.So, Harley gets to the police station and gets through with a powerful confetti gun in an action scene that exemplifies everything wrong with this movie\'s action scenes. They make literally no sense. There\'s having thin women defeat waves of larger men that make sense, like with the enhanced River Tam in Firefly and Serenity, but Birds of Prey makes no such kind of effort. She\'s attacking a police station with a weapon, and the only time anyone pulls a ranged weapon on her is when they\'re within striking distance of her own arms. This extends for about fifteen minutes as the action scene evolves to include prisoners and then the, ugh, other mercenaries. No one tries to fire a ranged weapon unless she can reach them with her arms. Also, no one will approach this woman more than one at a time. Now, it\'s really hard to make convincing action scenes of one against many, but Birds of Prey simply highlights the fact that no one will approach Harley more than one at a time. Especially in the row of prison cells, with the sprinklers on to try and create a distinctive visual motif, the burly prisoners who...immediately attack the person who just released them from their cells (ugh) all go after her one at a time so that she can do gymnastics to defeat them.They get away, hide away, and get betrayed by a man who gives their location away to...people. It\'s unclear who. Anyway, while all of this is going on, the Crossbow Killer is going around killing people, supposedly bad people but it\'s never quite clear. Now, the movie does have a handful of laughs, and the biggest one is probably about how the Crossbow Killer wants to be called the Huntress. Her exasperation at no one knowing what she wants to call herself is genuinely funny. It\'s also short lived as the movie just goes back to being a confusing mess of nonsense.So, everyone ends up coming together for a couple of action scenes in an abandoned circus attraction on the wharf that looks completely dilapidated on the outside but works perfectly on the inside (the Joker, I guess). The action scenes are...weak, designed to look cool but feel loose and poorly executed. It doesn\'t help that Harley\'s large hammer is supposed to be hard and we see it hit people pretty softly with regularity. The five women end up defeating hundreds of guys with nary a scratch, Black Mask blows up with a grenade, and the girls end up at a taco place where Cassandra finally poops out the diamond. Yay, I guess.This movie has no center. It\'s supposedly Harley Quinn herself, but she\'s telling the story incredibly poorly, is incredibly unsympathetic, and would work far better as a supporting character. She was barely tolerable in Suicide Squad as a supporting player, and pushed to the fore here she\'s grating. The movie has a handful of entertaining moments, but they\'re really far and few between. This movie was poorly written, poorly shot, and poorly edited. It has the ambition of an aggrieved Tumblr account.', ""Some movies decide to bring you along slowly, they setup the plot and bring you in by introducing you to the key players. Other movies kick the door open and grab you to take you along for the ride. Birds of Prey is decidedly one of the latter cases. We begin with an animated intro being narrated by Harley (Margot Robbie) where the audience is showered with cursing, violence and frenetic jokes. This was disarming for me and it helped me start laughing right off the bat. Its an odd choice to be sure but this isn't a movie that's ashamed or trying to hide what it is and I respected that choice. It also introduces the visual sensibility of the movie. It borrows from Suicide Squad but they do a good job cherry picking what worked from that movie and they leave behind the less desirable parts. The character cards are back with a couple of twists and the world is decidedly grimy and less glamorous which was a nice change of setting.My favourite aspect of the movie was the script, there's enough story to establish stakes and provide our characters with a common goal. Then the roller coaster picks up speed and we hit the ground running. The dialogue is quick and full of moments that left me chuckling or outright laughing, the emphasis is on a more realistic endgame instead of the end of the world (something that I've been beating a drum about whenever we get a superhero film) and the character intros have a nice mix of cool backstory but they take the time to show us what they're capable of and what they're about. It perfectly embodies Harley's nature (crazy, funny but you can't turn away) and screenwriter Christina Hodson deserves more kudos for her work.There are serious moments in Birds of Prey but there's more emphasis on the action and comedy. The action scenes here are memorable and they hold their own despite this not being a top dollar budget kind of blockbuster (the budget is still high at around 85 million but when you put that up against the Avengers movies, doesn't seem so big eh?). They aren't carbon copies, there's a dream sequence that's part action setpiece and musical number that felt like somebody slipped me something and the scene in the police station is so unconventional because they weave the narrative structure into how the scene plays out. They kept me engaged and it was also nice to be dealing with heroes that didn't have to rely on super powers and could really hold their own based on physical prowess.As much as this is pitched as an ensemble (it really isn't but I digress) Robbie is the star of the show and she proves that her fan favourite work in Suicide Squad wasn't a fluke. This isn't a dignified or glamorous role, much like her work as Tonya Harding, she gets into the uglier side of the character. Harley's really fun for a few seconds and then she'll do something disappointing or shocking and because of Robbie's work, she becomes a more well rounded character. She captures Harley's enigmatic nature and this is a triumph for her. If there's someone who really caught my attention other than our lead it was Jurnee Smollett-Bell as Black Canary. She not only looked the part but she had the tough attitude and the vulnerability all wrapped up into one. I had only seen her in Temptation (which I also liked her in but the movie sucked overall) but she was excellent here and I hope we get to see more of her again in this role soon. Rosie Perez and Mary Elizabeth Winstead were both solid, they were the supporting players in the crew but they each got their moments (more on Winstead later). I was so sure going in I was going to hate Cassandra Cain as a character but Ella Jay Basco hit the right notes and I thought she worked well with the rest of the cast. Kid characters get annoying fast when they're not done right and she was a good addition to this group. I want to credit Chris Messina as a pitch perfect Victor Zsasz but I also have to talk about our antagonist Roman Sionis played by Ewan McGregor. This is a weird performance by Ewan, he's so off-kilter and his tone changes from scene to scene. He's a great actor and he won me over but I had a hard time getting a handle on what he was trying to do. But I still think he did a good job overall.The strengths of Birds of Prey shine so brightly that it helped me look past a couple of things that bothered me. The movie does start to lose a little momentum at the 3/4 point, its pace had been very frenetic and breezy but when the emotional stakes come in, they hit the breaks a little too hard. I liked the character of Huntress and Winstead's performance but we could have used more time with her, she could almost have been cut out of the movie. I also didn't like the score, the musical choices were very obvious and while I like that style of music, the movie featuring so many classic rock/pop hits made the music feel more generic next to the rest of the movie.This movie isn't a perfect package and while I did walk away with notes and criticism but I was so happy leaving the theatre. Birds of Prey doesn't just break away from the rest of the DC Universe, it blazes a brand new trail. It has more in common with Doom Patrol and Deadpool than Batman v Superman or Aquaman and it was so refreshing and unafraid to switch things up. Robbie throws herself into Harley, the plot shifts constantly and keeps you guessing, the action holds up and our heroine's zany humour is not only plentiful but brilliantly successful. As much as Margot deserves credit, Prey's MVP is screenwriter Christina Hodson who delivers a bonkers script that throws curve after curve (along with some solid comedic dialogue) and when paired with Yan's direction, Birds of Prey is a home run. Purists may have issues with the representation of a couple of the characters but I don't have that background. I'm happy to give Birds of Prey an 8.5/10 rounding up to a 9/10. I would absolutely recommend checking this out in the theatre, this kind of entry in the genre is the best way to fight superhero blockbuster fatigue. My message to the executives is that if you want people to keep showing up to see the big comic book movies, we need different and daring films which Birds of Prey is unabashedly so."", ""With some great, all out performances, and a sheer sense of fun energy; Birds of Prey makes for an entertaining comic book film that may not be totally original, but is certainly different from the rest. The film's script can be a bit average at times, containing plot points you have certainly seen before, however, where Birds of Prey shines most is its unique sense of storytelling and the ridiculously entertaining things it does with it. Margot Robbie give a 'fabulous' performance as Harley Quinn, removing all my doubts of her playing the famous character after Suicide Squad. The other women in the film also give some great performances, with the greatest stand out being Mary Elizabeth Winstead who steals every ounce of her screen time, bringing her A-game as always. Ewan McGregor also gives a fun filled performance as the film's titular villain Black Mask. The film is filled with absolutely awesome action sequences that are bound to at least put a grin on your face, and if that doesn't, then the large dose of well-timed humor will certainly do the trick. In the end, Birds of Prey isn't the best DC has had to offer, but it is certainly a blast, and certainly an experience unlike any other. My Rating: 9.25/10"", 'While Margot Robbie is a good Harley Quinn, the character was not given enough arc. The plot was predictable and mainstream, especially due to lack of a strong antagonist. The main antagonist, played by Ewan McGregor, was not developed and hence did not add significant value to the plot story. Although some of the fight scenes were entertaining, the film as a whole was truly forgettable.', 'She plays her tricks but she is bad at it.My Expectation were Very low because its a DC movie about an annoying-overrated character. Plus DC movies aren\'t good.Story: Its about a crazy ""girl"" in a crazy world.Acting well Its fine. By the end when the ""girls"" assembled it looked really bad. The Cain girl is awful. It might be because the movie is awful. Let\'s hope. There\'s more I can say about her.Pacing it Is fine. The narration is annoying. She tries hard to be funny.Characters are meh. Let\'s say arrowvese did these characters justice. The Lead character sucks. All other characters are piss poor.It\'s a Colourful movie.Stupid beanbag police scene. int the 90\'s you could get away with it. But in 2020 f\'n 2020 nah. Fight scenes were forcefully bad. Is crazy crazy a super power.She breaks into a police station twice and has time to go shopping?It tries to be as bad as those 2 Deadpool movies. It does.Overall it\'s Made for whiny childern and lil girls. All of the characters are garbage. So sad.Verdict: DC...You are Failingah!!!.', 'Greetings from Lithuania.""Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn"" (2020) movie was as ridiculous as its title. Besides of some action scenes, this movie was boring, bland, not funny and simply snooze fest. I forced myself into watching it during a whole week, like 10 min per day because it was highly uninvolving little flick. The script here is poor, there was nothing that resembled a interesting plot.Overall, just like ""Suicide Squad"" this movie did not worked at all. DC really needs to start hiring real talents behind the camera because if they will continue this way, soon there won\'t be many viewers.', 'This film start with Harley Quinn narrate about she broke up with Joker, and everyone want her dead, including a crime lord ""Roman"" scene! As turnout, this film is about Harley Quinn need to protect a girl ""Cassandra"" from Roman, because Cassandra accidentally stole Roman\'s ring and swallow it! Entire film full of annoying narration voice and flashback scene of Harley Quinn! Make the film unwatchable! Barely laughable scene is, The Huntress want to say her name, but the people keep mocking her name! The action in the film also quite messy, not intense and full of overuse slow motion scene! The action have shooting scene, martial art fighting scene, hitting with baseball bat scene, and stabbing scene! All the action scene barely watchable, because it not enough bloody violence scene! Such as, Harley Quinn shooting at the police station scene! She shooting confetti instead of real bullet! LMFAO! At the end, Harley Quinn and Cassandra kill Roman by a grenade! Harley Quinn\'s sidekicks setup a gang called ""Birds Of Prey""! Still have one post credit narration scene from Harley Quinn! She mocking the audience still stay put and talking a secret about Batman! That\'s it! Another disappointed blockbuster film!', ""Birds of Prey (2020) is a movie we saw in theatres shortly after it came out. The storyline focuses on Harley Quinn post Suicide Squad after she breaks up with the Joker, recovers from her depression from the breakup, and starts a new life of crime with a new crew of thieves known as Birds of Prey. A lunatic is not a fan of her work and sets out to hunt her and her crew down and bring them to their demise. This movie is directed by Cathy Yan (Dead Pigs) and stars Margot Robbie (Suicide Squad), Rosie Perez (White Men Can't Jump), Ewan McGregor (Trainspotting) and Jurnee Smollett (Lovecraft Country). The storyline for this is a huge step down from Suicide Squad and maybe the worst DC movie to date. The film tried to be cool and creative but everything from the title, storyline and premise was delivered poorly, which is too bad because the cast had potential, the writing and execution failed the potential though. Birds of Prey is a great DC storyline...but that team was created and led by Barbara Gordon, so why use that premise, remove Barbara and insert Harley Quinn, and think you'll be fine? Easy, to capitalize on the money from Suicide Squad. Unfortunately, it didnt work. I wouldn't recommend watching this and I wish DC didnt ruin this title and these characters (who are actually very good). I'd score this a 3/10 and recommend skipping it."", 'Funny, non stop action, kinda all over the place. Margot Robbie absolutely steals the show.', ""Continues a wining-ish streak for DC with a pretty solid film that is at the very least WAY better than Suicide Squad. It's messy as hell, at times crassly mean-spirited, and mostly not that funny, but for the most part it's still a great deal of fun. Harley is still a fun character, and this version of her that is more than just an oversexualized girlfriend of the Joker is a much more interesting character to follow. Her girl gang and resentful breakup is also just a very human story. Yeah it was done better in the animated series currently on DC Universe, but still, this one is fun. The other Birds are pretty good, especially Huntress, but this really is Harley's show, and she's good. I do have to give love to Ewan McGregor as Black Mask. Yeah he's done villains before, but good god, this is one helluva villain. I love the character Black Mask, and he absolutely nails the character. Charming, funny, completely psychotic, I was a happy geek watching him on screen. Not to mention McGregor is clearly having a ball in the roll, and that energy does pass on to you. Overall though Birds of Prey is a mess. It's plot is basically Snatch but not as good, and it's attitude is aggressive, but god damn does it ever have an attitude. It has an identity, a style, and a look I can't deny, and I will admit it was pretty fun. It's got some solid performances, characters I wanted to see, and a solid style. It's a wild swing, and while it doesn't totally nail it, I admire it's ambition."", 'Did you catch the 2016 DCEU disappointment SUICIDE SQUAD with Will Smith as Deadshot and Jared Leto as the Joker? Many people (myself included) thought that that film was ""just fine, nothing special"" but were impressed with the way Margot Robbie handled the Harley Quinn character and wished for a standalone film that featured the Harley Quinn character.Be careful what you wish for.BIRDS OF PREY (AND THE FANTABULOUS EMANCIPATION OF ONE HARLEY QUINN) is the answer to that wish and while it is slightly better than SUICIDE SQUAD, it still isn\'t all that....well...Fantabulous... of a film.BIRDS OF PREY (which I hear is now being relabeled HARLEY QUINN: BIRDS OF PREY) is produced by Margot Robbie\'s production company and features an all female lead cast (the villain is a male) and a female Writer and a female Director. Consequently, this is a ""female empowerment"" film where the self-described ""tough chicks"" band together to defeat the male villain.I applaud the effort and the idea behind the movie, but as a film, this one didn\'t quite work for me.I start with the main focus of this film - Harley Quinn. This is just not a character, I discovered, that I want to spend an entire film with. She is, at it turns out, a very good SUPPORTING character, but not one that is interesting enough (at least for me) to carry a whole movie. I will give Margot Robbie credit...her interpretation of the character is interesting and that performance kept me focused throughout.The other Birds of Prey are just as interesting. For the first time in I can\'t tell you, Rosie Perez did not annoy me in her role. She played earnest, frustrated Police Officer Renee Montoya and I found myself rooting for her when she was on the screen. Same goes for Jurnee Smollett-Bell\'s interpretation of Black Canary a character I knew very little about and was intrigued (though her ""Super Power"" was suddenly sprung on the audience with very little foreshadowing - foreshadowing that could have helped). And, finally, Mary Elizabeth Winstead almost steals the film as the revenge-seeking Huntress, a character I really enjoyed and hope I see again (though, I\'m learning my lesson - let it be as a supporting character in another film and not her own, standalone film).So, this film has 4 interesting characters at the top, but the issue is that they don\'t come together as a team until VERY late in the film (in a finale showdown that was the highlight of the film for me), so I really couldn\'t tell if there was any chemistry between these characters/actresses. I think there MIGHT have been, but no real sample size to tell.Fairing less well as a character was Ewan McGregor\'s one-note take on super-narcissistic Roman Sionis/Black Mask. The character was pretty much in front of you at the start of the film and was still the same one-note character at the end. Also not ""doing it for me"" was Ella Jay Basco as Cassandra Cain, the street kid that becomes the focal point of the bad guys in the film (and the character the Birds of Prey must band together to save). I didn\'t much care for this character - or the performance - so I had no real emotional investment in whether or not the Birds of Prey could save her.The Direction by Cathy Yan is professional and competent and the final showdown does show signs of originality and brilliance. I\'ll give her credit, she caught my attention with the last 1/2 hour of this film - much more so than she did with the first 79 minutes.A better effort at this type of anti-hero comic book adventure (certainly better than SUICIDE SQUAD) but the DCEU still has not stuck the landing on this.I encourage them to keep trying.Letter Grade: B7 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)', ""Birds of Prey is another great addition to the DCEU and whilst it certainly has its flaws, I absolutely had a blast with the filmMargot Robbit is perfect and she kills it. As for the supporting characters, they range genuinely are all good especially Mary Elizabeth Winstead who is awesome. As great as Ewan McGregor Is, he feels generic and kinda of a stupid villain although his over the topness does work well. The bad guys are great even if they aren't revolutionary. The story feels fresh and unique in style but if you look at the skeleton of a story, it really isn't anything special. I do love the cinematography and colours, it looks awesome. There are some really terrific scenes here. The action is great and done extremely well (thanks to having Chad Stahleski help), it looks great, shot great and well choreographed mostly. The slow motion doesn't work. Some of it feels brutal and I I that. My favourite action scenes were probably the one in the evidence room and the alley fight. But I do like the funhouse fight cause it's kinda original.The reason why I like the DCEU is because all their films have different tones unlike the MCU which feel very samey despite being in different having different genres. As far as Marvel Humour Syndrome goes, it does suffer not massively though. It just is a tad cringe at times (only a few), the light heartedness does work a lot of the time, but sometimes it could have done without Overall as great as the film is, It could really use some more depth in the story, other than it is decent. But that being said it still is a win for the DCEU."", 'As a ""D.C."" comics fan I see most all of the movies and this latest was a kick butt action style drama with twist and turns as it is a spotlight of bad girls at their best ""Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn delivers with action and story. Harley Quinn(Margot Robbie) has just split from her boyfriend ""The Joker"" so she has to spread her wings free and become a free girl! All of this is helped along by a cast of side characters like detective Renee Montoya, Huntress, and the sexy and beautiful black bra wearing Black Canary! However all are tied and wrapped up in a wild card subplot that involves defeating a crazy and sadistic crime lord in Roman Sionis(AKA ""Black Mask"") and underneath all of this lies the search for a diamond and teenager named Cass(Ella Jay Basco). Aside from all of this the film entertains with violence, action, bombs, and flashbacks that tell character story. Look at this as a bad ass female group as each fight crime and for their own way of life in a gleeful way The costumes are also an eye catch and the dialogue moves the film along well, so if a comic book fan open up to this picture as it\'s full of antiheroine glory.', 'Review: I really didn\'t enjoy this film. The ridiculous action scenes and silly jokes really got on my nerves and Margot Robbie went a bit overboard as the crazy Harley Quinn. Ewan McGregor (Roman Sionis) was also a terrible baddie, and the soundtrack made the whole film seem like a bit of a joke. On the plus side, the Huntress (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) was brilliant and the chemistry between the girls, when they joined forces, was half decent but it\'s hard to find anything else positive about the film. As the DC franchise is in a right mess at the moment, this film really doesn\'t help matters, which is a shame because it sounded promising on paper. If they do agree to make another movie, they really need to tone down Harley Quinn, who seemed more mentally disturbed than anything. The whole back and forth in time thing was also annoying and the way that the girls took out big grown men with ease, made me cringe. As I haven\'t read the comics, I don\'t know how close this Harley Quinn is to the written one, but from an entertainment point of view, I really found it hard to watch. As far as I am concerned, if your going to have an action-packed movie with wit, the least that they could do is make it funny. Anyway, I won\'t be watching this movie again in a hurry, and it has to go down as one of the biggest let-downs of this year. Disappointing!Round-Up: This movie was directed by Cathy Yan, who also brought you a movie called Dead Pigs, which I haven\'t seen or heard of. Now I know that these big studios are supporting these new up and coming directors, by giving them big-budget movies to work on as there first projects, but with DC in so many problems at the moment, they really needed someone in Christopher Nolan\'s league to save the franchise. I know that they wanted to make this an ""all-women"" affair, in terms of starring and working on this film, but I personally think that the final product was awful. The whole thing just seemed silly and unfunny, but it still made a decent profit at the box office, even though we are in the middle of a pandemic. With the critics and a majority of audiences around the world, completing slating the movie, I wonder if the big wigs behind the DC universe will finally listen to us because it\'s obvious that they are wasting time and money on these movies, which are definitely not working.Budget: $84.5million Worldwide Gross: $202millionGenre: Action, Adventure, Crime Cast: Margot Robbie, Rosie Perez, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Jurnee Smollett, Ewan McGregor, Ella Jay Basco, Chris Messina, Ali Wong, Steven Williams and David Ury. 3/10', 'In Gotham City, the Joker breaks up with Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) and without his protection, several criminals that have a beef with her hunt her down.

My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Aves de Rapina: Arlequina e sua Emancipação Fantabulosa"" (""Birds of Prey: And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn"")', 'The film starts with Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) telling her story from the beginning through an animated intro. As a child, her deadbeat alcoholic dad tried to get rid of her multiple times until he finally dumped her at a Catholic girls school. Harley was always a troublemaker, but she got educated and earned a PhD, becoming a psychologist. That\'s where she met The Joker and fell in love, leading her to go from Harleen Quinzel to Harley Quinn. However, they have recently broken up since he helped her escape from prison (shown at the end of the previous film \'Suicide Squad\'), and despite Harley saying she was fine, she does not take it well and ends up staying alone in a crummy apartment with a hyena she adopted and named Bruce (after Bruce Wayne).Harley goes to the Black Mask club where she gets plastered (drunk) and annoys a nearby thug who insults her. She ends up smashing his leg, and is told by the club\'s owner, Roman Sionis/Black Mask (Ewan McGregor), that that was his driver. He does nothing because Harley hasn\'t told anybody that she and Joker are broken up, since them being a couple gave her immunity from the wrath of Gotham\'s other thugs. Harley is out with other women whom she overhears saying that she\'s nothing without Joker and that she\'ll go running back to him soon enough. Harley decides to challenge this by driving a truck into Ace Chemicals where she and Joker used to stay, obliterating the plant into an explosion of fireworks.Moments before this, Detective Renee Montoya (Rosie Perez) is investigating what appears to be a mob hit at a restaurant. A flashback shows Helena Bertinelli/Huntress (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) killing the men inside with a crossbow, which has earned her the alias, ""The Crossbow Killer."" Montoya then hears the chemical plant explosion and goes to find Harley\'s J necklace, which is a clear sign to both cops and criminals that she and Joker are no more, meaning Harley has just declared open season on herself.Among the criminals that want Harley dead are Roman and his best friend/right hand man Victor Zsasz (Chris Messina), a psychopath who carves a tally on his body for every one of his victims. They are shown torturing the Keo family and cutting their faces off.Harley is getting her ""perfect egg sandwich"", but Montoya and a few other pissed off crooks find and go after her. Montoya tackles Harley and causes her to drop her sandwich into the street, which devastated Harley. When it seems like she\'s cornered, she throws a bag of garbage at Montoya, which blindsides one crook and causes him to shoot an incoming truck-driving crook, allowing Harley to get away. Unfortunately, she runs into a large thug that she and Joker face-tattooed, but before he can get her, he is killed by Helena on her motorcycle. Harley is then surrounded by Roman\'s thugs.Montoya returns to the police station where she is mocked by other officers. She meets with Captain Patrick Erickson (Steven Williams), who was her former partner that took credit for her hard work and got promoted, and District Attorney Ellen Yee (Ali Wong), who is also Montoya\'s ex. She is building a case against Roman but doesn\'t have much support from either of them. Montoya is then brought to Cassandra Cain (Ella Jay Basco), a young girl brought in for pick pocketing. Montoya then gets a call from Dinah Lance/Black Canary (Jurnee Smollett-Bell), saying that Cass has a diamond with her. Soon, Harley comes in and tries to go after Cass, but she realizes she is getting ahead of herself in the story.A week earlier at the club, Roman was telling Mr. Keo (Francois Chau) about the Bertinelli Diamond, which contains codes to their massive fortune and is now in Roman\'s possession. The diamond was also the reason Helena\'s whole family was slaughtered. Keo refused to work with Roman, which is what later leads to the demise of him and his family. Dinah works at the club as a singer, noted for her beautiful voice. She later talks to a drunken Harley, who admits to her that she and Joker broke up. Harley then drinks with another man who later tries to abduct her. Dinah sees this and beats up the man and his buddies. Roman observes this from his window and is impressed, and he has Zsasz bring Dinah up so he can hire her as his new driver. This leads Montoya to try and get info from Dinah on Roman, but she refuses to help.Dinah knows Cass because they live in the same building, and Dinah has a soft spot for Cass since she knows she lives with abusive foster parents. Later on, Cass picks Zsasz\'s pocket and steals the diamond, just before she is arrested for other stuff she stole.Just after Harley gets away from Montoya, Roman\'s guys capture her. She knows he had a long list of grievances against her (such as ""voting for Bernie, pronouncing it \'expresso\', and calling him Romey""). Roman smacks Harley around, at which point she has a fantasy about herself as Marilyn Monroe in a ""Diamonds Are A Girl\'s Best Friend"" sequence. Before Roman can have Harley killed, he learns from Zsasz that the diamond is gone. Harley offers a chance to recover the diamond, which Roman agrees to. After she leaves, he orders a bounty on Cass.Cut to Harley attacking the police station with colored smoke and confetti bombs. She breaks Cass out but also lets loose other crooks who want to kill her. Harley fights them all on her own, with a little help from Cass, utilizing a baseball bat and lighter, among other things. More goons who want Cass and the diamond shows up, and after inhaling some coke, Harley kills them. She escapes the station with Cass in tow and takes her somewhere safe.Roman learns that Harley and Cass got away from his goons. He loses his shit and spots a woman, Erika (Bojana Novakovic), in his club laughing, and Zsasz convinces Roman that she is laughing at him. He orders Erika to dance on the table and to take off her dress, going as far as to order her friend to cut it off of her. This shows Dinah just how monstrous Roman is.Harley learns that Cass swallowed the diamond and goes to a supermarket to buy laxatives, warning her that anyone else will have no problem cutting it out of her. They rob their supplies and go back to Harley\'s apartment, which is above a Taiwanese restaurant run by Doc (Dana Lee), a kindly man who keeps Harley safe. After Harley and Cass go upstairs, Helena approaches Doc to ask for Harley. Harley then cuts to Helena\'s backstory: after her family was murdered by mob boss Stefano Galante (Roberto Catrini), one of Galante\'s goons saw that she survived but took her away to Sicily to stay with his brother and father. They trained Helena to become the killer that she is now. She killed Galante, and the mob guys from earlier were the firing squad that killed her family. Zsasz is the last name on her list.Back at the police station, Montoya finds out that Yee went behind her back and told Erickson that she stole evidence from a crime scene. Erickson suspends Montoya.Harley\'s apartment comes under attack by one of Roman\'s goons. The place gets blown up, and Bruce goes missing. Harley learns that Doc sold her out to Roman\'s goons because they paid him well. Harley then contacts Roman and offers to trade Cass in exchange for immunity. He agreed and has Dinah drive Zsasz to meet them, but Zsasz spots a text exchange between Dinah and Montoya to let her know where they are headed. He informs Roman, who becomes upset and puts on his Black Mask.Harley arranges to be met at an amusement park in a spot called the Booby Trap where she used to hide with Joker. Cass learns about the betrayal as Harley straps her to a toilet so she can pass the diamond. Montoya shows up first and fights Harley, nearly taking her in until Harley uncuffs herself and kicks Montoya out of the building. Dinah and Zsasz show up, but Zsasz hits Harley with a tranquilizer and prepares to kill her. Helena shows up and shoots Zsasz in the neck with an arrow, killing him. The ladies then confront each other until they see Roman show up outside with a whole army of thugs. Knowing that he has a bone to pick with all of them, Harley suggests they team up to fight them all. They reluctantly agree and grab a bunch of old weapons (mallet for Harley, bat for Dinah, brass knuckles for Montoya, etc) and head off to fight. They smash and bash their way through a bunch of goons before Roman manages to kidnap Cass. The ladies are cornered by armed goons until Dinah lets out a supersonic scream to take them down and allow Harley to go after Roman on roller blades.Harley chases Roman and gets knocked over by other goons. Helena rides by and gives Harley a pull, managing to kill those other goons before causing Roman\'s car to crash. He takes Cass to the pier and tries to taunt Harley, saying she needs him. She hits back that the criminals in Gotham should fear her, not him or Joker. Before Roman can hurt Cass, she reveals she planted a grenade on him and pulled the pin out. Harley throws Roman off the pier where he explodes into bloody chunks before hitting the water. The others join Harley and Cass, relieved that Roman is now gone.The next morning, the ladies gather for tacos and margaritas. Cass goes to pass the diamond, but she and Harley just steal Dinah\'s car and ride off.Later on, Erickson once again takes credit for Montoya\'s work in bringing down Roman and his empire. She quits the GCPD and joins Dinah and Helena to form the Birds of Prey using the money in the Bertinelli accounts.Harley and Cass pawn the diamond and ride away with Bruce (who turned up alive), with Harley taking Cass on as her apprentice. Harley says she may be a softie, but she dares anyone else to call her that.After the credits:Harley\'s voice can be heard getting ready to tell the audience a big secret about Batman... only for the audio to cut off.']"
22,DC Extended Universe,The Suicide Squad 2021,6334354,"[""I really enjoyed this ensemble superhero movie, the diretor's best since his similar GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY. It has the same fun, anything goes kind of vibe, and the CGI effects are out of this world. This one's a DIRTY DOZEN style men-on-a-mission flick, as a group of refreshingly quirky heroes land on an island to take down a corrupt regime and their dark scientific experiment.

James Gunn takes over as writer and director. It has all of his irreverent style. It is fun, colorful, and violent. It's a candy-coated punch in the face and kiss on the cheeks. It's very enjoyable and an improvement from the first movie. There is an issue with this franchise. The group is not stable. The only constant is probably going to be Amanda Waller and nobody likes her. Harley Quinn has been in both movies but her public pull is still in doubt.

Brief nudity.', ""I can't believe it's five years since I watched Suicide Squad at the cinema, I still moan about the waste of time and money, I loathed it.I went into this one with a degree of scepticism, but within the first five minutes, something just feels different, and that vibe continues through to the end, it is a totally different production, one I thoroughly enjoyed, it doesn't matter what kind of film you like, there is something here for you, it's funny, it's dark, it's of course action packed, and if like me, you like a bit of gore, then you may just find yourself enjoying this.I cannot remember the last time I enjoyed a hyped up film, I always seem to be at odds with the critics, however this time they're right.The acting does vary a little I would say, Idris Elba is just brilliant, it's nice to see him doing something a little different, I just wish Capaldi had a slightly bigger role.So good, I'm already booked in for a second viewing, 8/10."", 'What can be said about the Suicide Squad (yes the, not a or just Suicide Squad) ... and what can be said about James Gunn? I reckon some may have issues with his work - and that is fine. We all have different tastes. Him going comedy (though very dark and very violent and so many other things that certain people may call inappropriate) - is quite different from what Zac Snyder and DC stood for mostly. But succesful DC movies (at least at the box office) had quite a lot of fun included too - like Shazam to name another.But this is not that - we also have the previous Suicide Squad ... which while not really referred to, is in this too. Because you have some of the former members here. But of course a lot of new people too. The characters are as crazy as they can be - and the movie is as bloody as it is allowed too - it also has some nudity in it. The US has the R rating for movies like this ... UK and Germany went for the 15 and 16 rating respectively ... which some may find a bit low. That will depend on your sensibilities ... just be aware that there is a lot of gore, blood and other ""mature"" things depicted.The movie is not taking any prisoners (almost in a literal sense) and you never know who is going to bite the dust/bullet ... maybe even a member that you like a lot ... not to mention that morals are not really an issue for most members to say the least. Stick for an extra scene after the credits ... it does set up a future project (maybe it\'s already in the past when you read this)', ""In my review of the 2016 film, I noted that I wasn't inspired by it enough to check out a sequel if there was one. Well, now it's here and I'm back to the party, and by the look of things, this sequel clearly outdoes the original with a significantly higher IMDb rating. That's not to say parts of it aren't cheesy, they definitely are, when you consider two of your meta-human heroes are a land walking shark and a guy who kills with polka dots. That King Shark (voiced by Sylvester Stallone) had me reminiscing all the way back to those old time Saturday Night Live skits that used to crack me up. The kicker had to be the super villain who shows up in the latter half, and my word! - Starro the Conqueror finally made it into a DC flick! Starro's first appearance in a comic book story hearkens all the way back to March, 1960 in an issue of Brave and the Bold #28, in which it went up against the Justice League! How's that for longevity, sixty plus years of history for a giant starfish!I have to admit, the opening sequence was a little awkward with the first team being taken out so handily by the Corto Maltese military faction. But then the real Task Force X showed up to side with Sol Soria's (Alice Braga) freedom fighters. After that, it's one major dust up after another, with a couple of surprise outcomes that get further treatment in the after credits scene.As for the story, that's where it gets somewhat derivative. The American government in league with a foreign nation to suppress information about a top secret project that could be used for military purposes? Come on, that's like saying the NIH would fund a secret Chinese lab to engage in gain of function research. Oh, wait..."", 'The original Suicide Squad was a mixed bag but had its moments, spin-off Birds of Prey was much better, and this third instalment, only adding ""The"" to the title, was highly anticipated, written and directed by James Gunn (Slither, Guardians of the Galaxy). Basically, intelligence officer Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) recruits a team of Belle Reve penitentiary inmates to carry out a new suicide mission, threatened with bombs implanted in their heads if they go against orders, and with the promise of having their sentences reduced if successful. The team, led by Colonel Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman), are sent to the South American island nation of Corto Maltese after its government is overthrown by an anti-American regime. They are tasked with destroying the Nazi-era laboratory Jötunheim where a secretive experiment known as ""Project Starfish"" is taking place. However, the team are ambushed by Corto Maltese military, resulting in the deaths of Brian Durlin aka Savant (Michael Rooker), George Harkness aka Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney), Richard ""Dick"" Hertz aka Blackguard (Pete Davidson), Cory Pitzner aka T. D. K. ""The Detachable Kid"" (Nathan Fillion), Javelin (Flula Borg), and Mongal (Mayling Ng). The only survivor of the team is Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) who is captured by the military and through seducing the leader gains information of the new regime\'s plans to use Project Starfish against other nations. The distraction of the ambush allows a second team of inmates to enter the country undetected. The second team is led by Robert DuBois aka Bloodsport (Idris Elba), with Christopher Smith aka Peacemaker (John Cena), Nanaue aka King Shark (Sylvester Stallone), Abner Krill aka Polka-Dot Man (David Dastmalchian), and Cleo Cazo aka Ratcatcher 2 (Daniela Melchior). After finding Flag at a base camp for rebel soldiers, the squad convinces rebellion leader Sol Soria (Alice Braga) to assist them. The squad accomplishes their next objective of capturing Dr. Gaius Grieves aka the Thinker (Peter Capaldi), a metahuman scientist in charge of Project Starfish. After rescuing Harley, who managed to escape captivity herself, the team break into Jötunheim and rig the facility with explosives, while Flag and Ratcatcher 2 enter the underground laboratory with the Thinker. They discover Project Starfish is Starro the Conqueror, a giant intelligent alien lifeform resembling a starfish that controls its victims through smaller versions of itself. The Thinker reveals that Starro was brought to Earth by the American government, who have been secretly funding the experiments on Corto Maltese for decades. Peacemaker, under secret orders to cover up America\'s involvement, kills Flag after he refuses to surrender a hard drive containing evidence of this revelation. Meanwhile, the squad and the Corto Maltese military battle, causing Polka-Dot Man to accidentally set off the explosives prematurely. Ratcatcher 2 obtains the drive from Peacemaker and Bloodsport saves her by shooting Peacemaker. Starro escapes the laboratory, kills the Thinker and many of the military, and begins taking control of the island\'s population. Waller tells the squad that their mission is complete, but Bloodsport decides to lead the squad into battling Starro. Waller orders the squad to be executed for disobeying orders, but her subordinates knock her unconscious, wanting to save the population. Polka-Dot Man is killed, but Harley pierces a hole in the alien\'s eye and Ratcatcher 2 summons all rats of the city to chew Starro to death from the inside. With the military distracted, Soria takes control of the government and pledges democratic change. Using the drive as leverage, Bloodsport forces Waller to release him and his surviving teammates from their imprisonment in exchange for keeping its contents confidential, and they are airlifted out of Corto Maltese. In mid and post-credits scenes, the first team\'s Weasel (Sean Gunn) and Peacemaker are shown to be alive. Also starring Taika Waititi as Ratcatcher, Dee Bradley Baker as Sebastian, Natalia Safran as Kaleidoscope and Gerardo Davila as General Vera. Robbie is likeable as the gleefully homicidal anti-hero, Elba and Cena are both great being tough, Davis gets her sinister moments, and the other cast members do well. Unlike the original, the characters are much more layered, the story is interesting, the special effects, fights and explosive sequences are controlled, it leaves room for well-timed humour and gore, and a good soundtrack, including ""Folsom Prison Blues"" by Johnny Cash, ""Whistle for the Choir"" by The Fratellis, a fun anti-superhero fantasy action. Very good!', 'Well, if you enjoyed the 2016 ""Suicide Squad"" movie, then you will certainly enjoy the 2021 movie ""The Suicide Squad"" as well. Why? Well, simply put, because it is the same kind of cheesy entertainment.Writer and director James Gunn definitely managed to keep the movie up to par with the 2016 predecessor in terms of oddball characters, an outrageous script and an abundance of action.It should be said though that the 2021 ""The Suicide Squad"" is a step up in terms of graphic violence and sheer mayhem. For better or worse, then ""The Suicide Squad"" was rather bloody and gory. That was something I had not expected from the movie, but it was definitely something I welcomed to the movie, as it just felt rightly at place in the cheesy movie.The storyline told in ""The Suicide Squad"" is a no-brainer, and very much reminiscent of the 2016 movie. So this is essentially a movie where you lean back, munch the popcorn and just enjoy the action-packed ride.I can\'t claim that I was particularly impressed with the bad guy, villain or whatever you want to call a starfish of that size and magnitude. Sure, it made for some great spectacle of destruction, but the creature itself and the concept of it was just a bit far out there. But hey, then again, anything is possible in these movies I suppose.The characters in ""The Suicide Squad"" were colorful and bizarre, to say the least. And that was something that I definitely enjoyed in this 2021 movie, as they upped the character gallery quite a lot in comparison to the 2016 movie.I feel that Harley Quinn (played by Margot Robbie) was a bit underplayed in this movie, as her character wasn\'t really given enough time to show the usual level of whacky crazy that we saw in the other movies.The Bloodsport character (played by Idris Elba) was definitely one of the more detailed and layered characters in the movie, and let\'s just be honest here, Idris Elba was superbly cast for this particular role and performed it so well. It was fun to watch Michael Rooker portraying the Savant character in the movie, despite of not having all that much screen time.Then there was the King Shark character. When I first saw him, I must admit that I was ready to face palm myself. But as the movie progressed, I must admit that the character grew on me, and he definitely was a good comedy relief in the movie. And of course having Sylvester Stallone to do the voice was just great.I am not much of a fan of John Cena and his \'acting\', but the character he portrayed in ""The Suicide Squad"" was actually a well-written character and one that felt very much in place in the movie.Having mentioned King Shark, I also have to mention the Weasel (played by Sean Gunn). Wow, what a character. He was something unlike anything I have ever seen on the screen, both in terms of appearance, mannerisms and what part he played in the movie. This character was just glorious. But I bet there will be a lot of people out there disliking the character. But, to each their own.And it was really, really nice to see actor Joaquín Cosio in the movie, taking on the part as Mayor General Mateo Suarez. This guy seriously is a great actor, and a much underrated one at that. He was so nicely cast for the movie and brought a lot of flavor to the screen.Visually then ""The Suicide Squad"" is great. Of course it is great, given it being a D. C. movie about anti-heroes.I must admit that I wasn\'t initially expecting all that much from writer and director James Gunn\'s 2021 ""The Suicide Squad"", but it proved to be rather enjoyable and entertaining from beginning to end. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.My rating of ""The Suicide Squad"" lands on a six out of ten stars - or starfish...', ""Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn is the common denominator between two of DC's worst movies: David Ayer's abysmal Suicide Squad (my rating: 3/10) and the even worse Birds of Prey, directed by Cathy 'How the hell did she get that gig?' Yan (my rating: 1/10). Robbie returns for this sequel/reboot of The Suicide Squad, but this time she's in the more capable hands of director James Gunn, who has a proven track record with big budget, special effects laden blockbusters. Quinn is still a rather annoying character, but Gunn's film has so much else going for it that it's relatively easy to ignore her grating voice and mannerisms.Gunn began his movie career writing for Troma, penning such classics as Tromeo and Juliet (1996) and Terror Firmer (1999), and made his feature film directorial debut with gory sci-fi horror Slither (2006), and I can't help but feel that schlock horror is much closer to his heart than his family-friendly Guardians of the Galaxy films. Also written by Gunn, The Suicide Squad is certainly a whole lot of twisted fun, loaded with characters of dubious morality, bad taste humour and the type of graphic violence that would easily have earned the film an R-rating a decade or three ago (or seen it edited of all of its nasty stuff in good old Blighty-Gawd bless the BBFC). As a die-hard horror fan with an appreciation of the absurd, this adventure for the Suicide Squad is just how I like my comic book movies: dark, demented, and very gory.Robbie aside, the cast is excellent, with Idris Elba as Bloodsport, leading a crazy squad of anti-heroes on a seemingly impossible mission to destroy a scientific research building on the island of Corto Maltese, home to Project Starfish, a gigantic alien called Starro the Conquerer that can generate tiny duplicates that latch onto other sentient beings, thereby allowing the creature to control their minds. Joining Bloodsport are assassin Peacemaker (John Cena), Ratcatcher 2 (Daniela Melchior), Polka-Dot Man (David Dastmalchian), and King Shark (voiced by Sylvester Stallone), all of whom have their own particular and peculiar skills. Harley Quinn joins the 'squad' later on, a survivor of an earlier mission of which she is one of the few survivors (the others being heroic Colonel Rick Flag, played by Joel Kinnaman, and my favourite character, a bug-eyed, child-killing creature called Weasel, presumed drowned but seen recovering and scampering away at the very end of the film).Other familiar faces joining in the fun are Gunn regular Michael Rooker as Savant (one of the not-so-lucky members of the first assault), the 'Twelfth Doctor' Peter Capaldi as scientist Thinker, Viola David as ruthless Suicide Squad controller Amanda Waller (also returning from Ayer's messy original), Firefly's Nathan Fillion as T. D. K (I won't spoil things by revealing what that stands for), Jai Courtney as Boomerang, and Taika Waititi as Ratcatcher 2's father, Ratcatcher.With such a stellar cast, and an A-list director at the helm, it's clear that no expense has been spared to ensure that The Suicide Squad isn't a flop this time around, and this is also evident in the superb digital special effects, of which there are plenty. I'm not the biggest fan of CGI, which can be the ruin of many a movie, but when it is of this calibre, it's fine by me - the film looks great throughout, whether it be chaos and destruction on a massive scale, more artistic flourishes (Harley Quinn on a killing spree surrounded by cascading flower petals and animated birds), or King Shark tearing a victim limb from limb.I had such a good time with The Suicide Squad I don't even mind that Harley Quinn wasn't one of the many characters to die a gruesome death, and I look forward to further sequels and spin-offs (Peacemaker is already slated for his own movie), just so long as Gunn is in control. But can we have a bit more of Weasel next time, please?7.5/10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb."", ""Yeah, I get it. There are a lot of superhero movies. But saying there are too many is like saying there are too many slashers or comedies. It's a genre in and out of itself that can tell a variety of different stories. And nobody has done a better job of that than James Gunn, who started in the world of Troma and low budget horror like Slither before making Super and then taking over his own part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe with Guardians of the Galaxy.But let me tell you - this is basically a high budget low budget film with a heart and you'd be silly to skip it. What other movie would be audacious enough to - spoiler warning - kill more than half its cast including most of the names on the poster before the credits even begin?Where David Ayer's Suicide Squad was pretty much considered a fumble - I liked the Deadshot moments and seeing the cast on screen - this movie fully lives up to the premise of John Ostrander's run on the comic book. These are the very lowest of the low when it comes to super-villainy, forced by the American government to do missions where there's every single chance they'll die, whether at the hands of their enemy, one another or by the bombs implanted in their heads by their team leader Amanda Waller (Viola Davis, perhaps given less to do in this movie but nailing exactly who the character is).Two different versions of Task Force X have been sent to the island of Corto Maltese to destroy Jötunheim, a laboratory that holds the secret of Project Starfish. One team - led by Rick Flag made up of Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie, who has this character down as perfect as it gets), Captain Boomerang (a sadly wasted Jai Courtney), Savant (Michael Rooker), The Detachable Kid (Nathan Fillion), Javelin (Flula Borg), Mongal (Mayling Ng), Weasel (all CGI and looking like Bill the Cat) and Blackguard (Pete Davidson) will take the beach. The other - using them as a distraction - is Peacemaker (a perfect John Cena), Bloodsport (Idris Elba), King Shark (voiced by Sylvester Stallone), Polka-Dot Man (David Dastmalchian, not the first choice for a superhero character or actor, which should explain a bit of this movie to you) and Ratcatcher 2 (Daniela Melchior).This is a deep cut, but even Squad pilot Briscoe shows up to fly their transport. Deeper still is getting characters like Calendar Man, Kaleidoscope and Double Down into the prison.There's really no way that I can be subjective in my review of this. The Ostrander-era Suicide Squad is my favorite comic of all time and I subscribe to its modern remix Copra - you should too RIGHT NOW - and this movie completely hits all of the right notes, from how Killer Shark could eat anyone on the team at any time to Savant running from the battle and paying the price.So yeah. There are a lot of superhero movies. There is only one that has a kaiju starfish, a man who loves peace so much that he'd kill for it, full-frontal male nudity and perhaps the most gore I've ever seen in a mainstream film, as well as moments in the Project Starfish lab that would not feel out of place in an Italian zombie film.Movies can be and should be escapist fun. In a world where nearly every DC film has faltered to almost astounding levels, unable to even get the character of Superman correct in the last few decades, Gunn hits it out of the park. I can't wait for the Peacemaker show and whatever comes next.This is how you should feel after watching a blockbuster, folks."", 'This from is fun, exciting and has a ridiculous story line. The characters are distinctive. The starfish is just so funny. I enjoyed it.', 'A team of super-villains can shorten their jail sentences by going on missions as the titular Suicide Squad. They\'re not expected to return, and they definitely won\'t if they stray from the mission, or disobey direct orders, and have their implanted explosives detonated.It\'s the kind of ridiculous, contrived concept that we don\'t expect to work outside of a comic book. Not even in an adaptation. And yet, it does, incredibly well. You\'ll be surprised by how much you care about some of the members. Others are deliciously despicable, and we hate their guts. The level of interpersonal conflict is fun, and yet you can believe that someone would intentionally put all these people together. The action is tremendously enjoyable. No two characters are overly similar, no one disappears into the background, everyone does at least one major memorable thing, and like in Birds of Prey, Harley Quinn(Robbie, continuing to prove she\'s the perfect choice, she completely understands what makes Harleen tick) is given great scenes, dialogue, depth.James Gunn brings all of his strengths to this. He handles the ensemble cast without getting bogged down in their introductions: instead, he uses an impactful, if short one for each, giving them something quick yet defining to do early after we meet them, and, of course, utilising, without abusing, the useful narrative shortcut of exposition. This is emotional, if not as much as the two Guardians of the Galaxy movies. The use of music fits and is effective, not on the nose boring choices that play only very briefly, and are followed up maybe a minute later with another cue. While I have to admit that this is the first R-rated picture of his that I watched, I would definitely say that he should get to do more of these in the future. It still doesn\'t feel like he\'s awkwardly constrained when he works with a PG-13, but he really knows how to use the freedom here. We do get ridiculous amounts of violence(and swearing. It is thankfully nearly completely devoid of gratuitous sexuality and nudity, that would only distract. Of course I wouldn\'t be against it if it served a purpose; there is no time in this when that would have been the case, though) that is expected from this kind of thing, yes, meanwhile, We also get some legitimately powerful, disturbing material. Of course not every film has to ""have something to say""; however, it can be extremely gratifying when we see one that does(and does it well), and this is one of those instances.I recommend this to anyone who finds the trailers appealing. They give you an excellent idea of what to expect. 8/10.', ""Amanda Waller sends more villains out against a threat on Corto Maltese. Or should that be Maltayzee?Some returning characters and plenty of new faces populate a second outing for the anti-hero title which demonstrates very clearly why joining the Squad is suicidal. There is a great deal of graphic violence here, a huge amount of profanity, some spectacle, some humour, and some very unexpected deaths.Idris Elba's character was clearly intended to be Will Smith's deadshot to the extent of dominating the film (plus having identical abilities and backstory).The Big Bad was very obviously a bloke in a mo-cap suit: some effort should have been given to animating some non-human movement.The tone is noticeably lighter than the previous movie and, once again, Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn is the standout character, although I did enjoy a number of the others.Yes, I liked it."", ""THE SUICIDE SQUAD (2021) *** 1/2 MARGOT ROBBIE, IDRIS ELBA, JOEL KINNAMON, JOHN CENA, DANIELA MELCHIOR (the voice of SYLVESTER STALLONE), DAVID DASTMALCHIAN, VIOLA DAVIS, MICHAEL ROOKER, NATHAN FILLION, PETE DAVIDSON, STEVE AGEE.

I like the superhero genre, but I have a slight preference for DC Comics. Marvel movies are good as well but DC just has better funny action movies. The Suicide Squad has a lot of funny scenes and dialogues which is very entertaining. The cast is just great. All good actors that did a great job. Maybe the CGI's could have been better in some scenes but overal it's visually all looking good. The story is entertaining as well, a bit over the top at times but that's normal in this genre of movies. I can't wait for another movie with DC Comics characters, in the hope it's as good again."", ""Personally I till don't know why they called it part 2.

And I must say not the greatest still the action and adventure journey like feel was entertaining as it was nice watching anti hero and liked bad characters go against the grain and do some dirt work for the government. The Suicide Squad this time is recruited for a mission to fight evil international enemies and cons from prison off the island of Corto Maltese. And you guessed it the action and fighting is in top form being lead by Harley Quinn and Bloodsport. Nice along the way to see the introduction of the squad\'s new sidekick a human eating shark(voiced and done by Sly Stallone) who was so loveable and liked. Overall not the greatest film, yet probably a good action watch for any fan of D. C. comics and their movies.', 'Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman): ""Here\'s the deal: we fail the mission, you die!"" Bloodsport (Idris Alba): ""We find out any information you\'ve given us is false, you die!"" Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie): ""We find out you have personalized license plates, you die!""Woven into the above quote is the heart of the ingenious superhero satire, The Suicide Squad. The adventure is a relentlessly action-oriented and bloody superhero/supervillain mashup with an equal measure of droll humor like ""personalized plates."" This Keystone-Cops band of doomed mercenaries is working to overthrow the dictatorship of a small South American island, Carto Maltese.The first act, reminiscent of the comic-book derived Suicide Squad but with more bite, is non-stop joking in the spirit of Deadpool, possibly wittier. The usual introduction of the talented but eccentric band is rife with guffaw jokes and satire.Sylvester Stallone stands out as the mumbling King Shark, who eats humans, as apt a metaphor for invading armies as you could want. Ratcatcher 2 (Daniela Melchior) carries the physical weight of a loathed herd of rats and the metaphoric importance of what an invading army is thought to be. The wildly dangerous Weasel (Sean Gunn) reminds us that a Groot-type will often show up in this genre but maybe more terrifying and right from hell.While the second act drags as in most superhero movies, the third, with the struggle to overtake a malignant tower housing a monster alien starfish, is chockful of jokes again and just as importantly the themes of a vulnerable population and rise of the meek. With the action at peak, writer/director James Gunn still lards the story with wit.The Suicide Squad, be it a sequel or a remake (arguable for either descriptor), is a smart takeoff on the genre for those tired of the more serious Marvel series. It\'s plain good fun, well-acted, and expertly photographed (See it in IMAX if you can).

It is quite chilling to see Bloodsport and Peacemaker have a grisly killing competition then realize the rebel armies they massacred are actually allies, but there is no consequences, as long as they share the same enemy. Then, as the last resort, it is the puissance of the have-nots, the multitude, symbolically denoted by teeming rodents, that save the day, THE SUICIDE SQUAD is nothing if not politically perceptive.""read my full review on my blog: Cinema Omnivore, thanks.', ""'The Suicide Squad (2021)' is technically a sequel to the abysmal 'Suicide Squad (2016)', in the sense that it takes place within the same world, is set after its events and features a few of its characters. In practice, though, there is actually very little connecting the two films, as this outing doesn't even (directly) reference its plot and it acts as a totally stand-alone experience. Plus, the difference in quality between the two is absolutely night and day. Basically, I'm saying that disliking 'Suicide Squad (2016)' (as most people do) has no bearing on whether or not you'll enjoy 'The Suicide Squad (2021)' (annoyingly similar title aside). The film focuses on Task Force X, a group of mostly C-list (and very expendable) villains who have been recruited to engage in black ops missions in exchange for a reduction in their prison sentences. The squad is tasked with infiltrating a South American island to recover or destroy a dangerous weapon known only as Project Starfish. The plot is relatively straightforward, essentially presented as a single mission. At the same time, the plotting itself is actually somewhat messy, as the movie moves between the various characters it has split up and now needs to reunite. This isn't a huge issue, but it is noticeable. As is the flick's preoccupation with subversion, which occasionally undercuts its emotional beats and often isn't as surprising as it seems to think it is. The movie's style is also so eclectic that it can occasionally feel a tiny bit incohesive. In general, though, the piece is remarkably good. It's a fun, irreverent and technically impressive affair that makes excellent use of large-scale sets and goes to insane lengths to ground its action in practical effects. The action sequences truly are incredible. They're pacy, propulsive and pretty darn brutal (the movie really earns its R-rating). They're also just really enjoyable, their clean choreography complimenting their no-holds-barred nature and their overarching practicality making even their most ridiculous moments seem tangible. Though the flick sometimes struggles to strike a balance between its dark humour and its desire to actually have an emotional impact, it generally emerges as an engaging and somewhat affecting experience. A couple of its plentiful deaths actually have an impact, and it does a good job in developing its core characters just enough so that you genuinely care about them by the time the movie reaches its conclusion. The actors also help with this, imbuing their characters with a proper vitality and depth. Each main character gets their time to shine and, as such, there isn't a clear highlight. Ratcatcher 2, King Shark, Bloodsport, Peacemaker, Polka-Dot Man, Harley Quinn and even Rick Flagg (an incredibly boring character in concept) are all as empathetic and enjoyable as one another. Some of the other characters feel like throwaway gags but the core group is given just enough attention to seem like a rounded set of varied individuals. It's difficult to express just how good this film is when compared to its predecessor. It's incredibly accomplished from a technical point of view. It's also written really well, even if some of it falls a little flat and comes close to feeling 'edgy' for the sake of it. The film is exciting, energetic and enjoyable. Even when it isn't funny (which it often is), it's always fun. It also has proper stakes and a fair amount of nuance, including an underlayer of tragedy and anti-imperialism that runs throughout. It's easily the best thing in the DCEU; for once, that isn't a backhanded compliment. It's pretty great. 8/10."", ""My entire review has an asterisk on it. I had a terrible theater experience with a group of teen couples walking in halfway through the movie.

Smh i wanted to punch them in the face.And i'm the kind of person that can't miss a single line in the movie. I never leave theater while the movie is playing. But they were so distracting that i left to complain. They quieted down when the attendant was standing by them, but as soon as he left, they resumed. I can't stand inconsiderate ppl.As for the movie. It didn't impress me. I was mostly amused/entertained. But i barely laughed. The action is decent but none of the scenes stood out (i'm struggling to remember any later the same night).I don't really know what was missing, but i just felt like it was almost there but not quite. I'll give it another chance and see if i feel differently about it without morons surrounding me. But i could see it going either way, up or downmy biggest disappointment, which i know won't change, is the same major complaint about the first one: in a movie filled with villains, where is the evilness? Where is the darkness? Why do they want to take villains and make a fun superhero movie. We already have a thousand of them. Don't get me wrong, i love me my superhero genre, but you have the ability to make something so unique.Yeah this movie is filled with bad ppl, but they're portrayed as good, loyal ppl. At no point did i feel a bit of evil out of any of them. And i love that they went for it with the R rating, but that makes it even worse. It could have been truly dark and maybe a bit terrifying (1 viewing, 8/9/2021)"", 'Charming, but...took you guys long enough.This was the Marvel equivalent to what they did with The Incredible Hulk years after HULK. But, way better. Hell, even a better soundtrack than the ""original.""I think new-to-DC James Gunn KNEW this soft reboot of 2016\'s Suicide Squad would be predictable as all hell, and just ran with it. There were virtually no twists not foretold long before they happened and the character\'s arcs easy to forecast. But, that\'s okay. Gunn\'s filmmaking style and storytelling approach, in conjunction with a cast with extreme chemistry was refreshing.The Suicide Squad\'s back, sorta, and this time they\'re out to squash an alien. That\'s it. That\'s their mission. Of course, with a title like this, it ain\'t gonna be easy.I loved Margot Robbie again - still the best thing in the original theatrical cut, original extended cut and Birds of Prey. I miss her when she\'s gone and her scene-stealing when on, welcomed. Luckily, however, we also got the enormously charismatic Idris Elba, a FAR superior Bloodsport than Will Smith could\'ve dreamt of. And I even loved the hilarious Land Shark, Polka Man, the cute driver, Milton and the ""Oh, Rats"" Girl. I actually didn\'t have a problem with any of the characters here. Or their acting.Being a Gunn movie, it\'s well written and shot, naturally. But, while I loved how Hard-R this was (there was a penis shot,) and I\'m no prude whatsoever, I found the use of the F-word...excessive. Normally, I wouldn\'t have a problem, but every time they used it, probably 30-35 times, it felt like they were purposely putting it in to make this a Deadpoolesque Adult Comic Book Movie. Basically, a ton of the time, it was unnecessary and actually dragged down Gunn\'s typically smart dialogue.Second half\'s WAY better than the first, but once the movie kicked in, I was completely on board and loved it. Plus, again, that music - really kicked ass here. THIS is how you use music in a Suicide Squad movie.***Final Thoughts: Okay, Time to Update my Best-to-Worst DCEU list:1 Man of Steel 2 Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (Ultimate Edition, far superior to the Theatrical Cut) 3 Wonder Woman 4 The Suicide Squad 5 Birds of Prey and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn 6 Shazam!7 Suicide Squad (Extended Cut, Don\'t Even Bother with the Theatrical Cut) 8 Zach Snyder\'s Justice League 9 Aquaman 10 Wonder Woman 1984 11 Justice League.', 'Suicide Squad involved the U. S. government sending supervillains on suicide missions of ""national importance."" The movie is very funny, very dark, a bit gorier than I would have liked, and full of amazing action sequences. It\'s also got a little political commentary about U. S. intervention.The cast is terrific, most notably Margot Robbie, reprising her Harley Quinn role from an earlier ""Suicide Squad"" movie I never saw and the fabulous Birds of Prey. I really love her Harley, a psychopath with a heart of gold and killer reflexes who moves through the film like a chaos agent, fearless and improvident (if I ever watch the first, reputedly terrible Suicide Squad movie, it will be entirely due to Robbie).While the movie is crazy and hilarious, it also manages to put a little heart in, notably in the father/daughter vibe between Idris Elba and Daniela Melchior. Zach Snyder, who attempted and failed to create emotional resonance in Army of the Dead with a similar approach, should watch this movie over and over until he understands how to fit deep emotion and crazy action into a single film.This is a terrific movie, every bit as good as director James Gunn\'s Guardians of the Galaxy films, and you should definitely watch it.', 'The film opens at Belle Reve Penitentiary where Brian Durland/Savant (Michael Rooker) is in his break room throwing a ball around at targets that he has precisely set up. He even uses his skills to bounce the ball off the walls and kill a canary. He is then pulled away by Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) as she assigns him to a task.Savant is thrown into Task Force X/The ""Suicide Squad"" (also known as Team 2) alongside Blackguard (Pete Davidson), Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney), Weasel (Sean Gunn), Mongal (Mayling Ng), Javelin (Flula Borg), The Detachable Kid/TDK (Nathan Filion), and Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie). Led by Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman), the team travels to the island of Corto Maltese for their mission. Upon arriving, Weasel falls into the water and apparently drowns since nobody knew he couldn\'t swim. When the Squad makes it to land, Blackguard steps out and reveals he brought the team to the mercenaries waiting for them on the beach. For his troubles, he gets his face blown off. Harley goes in blasting while Boomerang throws his signature weapon to slice some heads off. TDK\'s arms pop off so he can use them as (ineffective) weapons. The mercenaries retaliate and shoot TDK and Javelin dead. Mongal attempts to bring a chopper down but it crashes and she burns to death. Boomerang is impaled with wood and then shredded by the chopper\'s blades. Harley and Flag go missing while Savant attempts to flee the chaos. Although Waller warns him, she detonates the explosive in the back of his head, causing it to blow up. She then sends in her second team to finish the job.Three days earlier.......Amanda Waller goes to recruit Robert DuBois/Bloodsport (Idris Elba), a deadly mercenary who is there for putting Superman in the ICU with a kryptonite bullet. Her leverage against him is Bloodsport\'s teenage daughter Tyla (Storm Reid), who is in danger of serving time for stealing. The two argue loudly, as Tyla makes it clear that Bloodsport was a bad father. He goes to threaten Waller into releasing Tyla, but she knows he is going to comply regardless. After he relents, she introduces him to her other recruits - Christopher Smith/Peacemaker (John Cena), a patriotic mercenary; Cleo Cazo/Ratcatcher 2 (Daniela Melchior), who has the ability to control rats and keeps one named Sebastian close by; Nanaue/King Shark (Sylvester Stallone), an underwater prince with a taste for human meat; and Abner Krill/Polka Dot Man (David Dastmalchian), a man with an unusual genetic disorder whose specialty is throwing weaponized polka dots.Waller informs the team about the situation in Corto Maltese - the nation was overthrown by a dictator named Silvio Luna (Juan Diego Botto) and his right-hand man General Mateo Suarez (Joaquin Cosio) after they executed the presidential family. They are operating in a Nazi-era research facility called Jotunheim where they are conducting dangerous experiments, code-named ""Project Starfish"". The Squad is assigned to find Dr. Gaius Grieves/The Thinker (Peter Capaldi) since he can lead them to Jotunheim and they can destroy whatever is going on in there. We jump to the facility where Luna and Suarez are observing their work, a gigantic starfish alien creature.Presently, while Team 2 is making their way through the jungle, they come across a group that they believe to be mercenaries in league with the military, so the Squad kills them before they make it to the camp where Flag is hanging out with his contact Sol Soria (Alice Braga), a dissident whose team, the Freedom Fighters, is trying to take Corto Maltese back from Luna and Suarez...and unfortunately her team was the group that the Squad just killed. The team walks out of the jungle when they notice Polka Dot Man glowing different colors. He explains that his condition happened because his mother worked at STAR Labs and experimented on him and his siblings to give them superpowers. His condition forces him to drain the dots out of him or he will die, and he views all of his enemies as his mother before killing them. Before heading to Jotunheim, Flag insists that they recover Harley.Harley has been taken captive by Luna\'s men, but he brings her to his room to woo her since she is seen in the country as a symbol of anti-American anarchy. Harley is initially charmed by him, and he even asks her to marry him. However, when he reveals his plan of using whatever is in Jotunheim to eliminate anyone who threatens his regime, even if it means killing children. This crosses Harley and she shoots Luna dead, leading to his men to capture and imprison her.The Squad is being taken by Sol\'s contact Milton (Julio Cesar Ruiz) to go to a bar called La Gatita Amable where they will find Thinker. On the road there, Ratcatcher asks Bloodsport why he is afraid of rats, as he is always recoiling around Sebastian even though, according to Cleo, he sees good in Bloodsport. DuBois states that his father once punished him with rats, and it lead to his phobia. When he asks her why she is so drawn to rats, she explains that her father, Ratcatcher 1 (Taika Waititi), taught her how to control them but also treat them as family, but he was a drug addict and ultimately overdosed when she was a child. Bloodsport and Ratcatcher promise to one another that they will get each other out alive. The team makes it to the bar, but Nanaue has to stay behind since he will stick out.The Squad drinks and dances before they spot Thinker. They apprehend him, but the military comes in to search everyone since they know that there are Americans in there. Bloodsport sends Ratcatcher outside with Thinker while he, Peacemaker, and Polka Dot Man are all taken in. On the road, the three subdue the gunmen and kill the driver before their van is run off the road. Ratcatcher and King Shark arrive with Thinker in tow.Meanwhile, Harley is being tortured by Suarez\'s men for information, but she never budges. When she is left alone with his guard, she snaps his neck with her legs and sets herself free. Harley proceeds to shoot down Suarez\'s guards before getting her hands on some blades and Javelin\'s... javelin to slaughter her way through the guards. Outside, Flag tries to lead the Squad to rescue Harley until she shows up and joins them. They then get Thinker and order him to get them inside Jotunheim.Once inside (and after Milton is killed), Thinker leads the Squad to the creature that he calls Starro The Conqueror. Peacemaker and Nanaue set up bombs all over the place. Thinker reveals to the Squad that the American government was behind the experiments involving Starro since they have been secretly funding Corto Maltese for decades. Starro also emits smaller starfish that attach themselves to human faces and take over their bodies like zombies, and there are slews of corpses of Starro\'s other victims all over the facility. Starro breaks free and grabs Thinker, tearing him in two and splattering him across the wall. Flag attempts to secure the hard drive with evidence against the American government to deliver to the press, but Peacemaker turns on him per Waller\'s orders. The two fight each other, with Flag nearly choking Peacemaker to death, but he stabs Flag through the heart with a piece of a broken sink. Ratcatcher witnesses this and grabs the flash drive while Peacemaker attempts to kill her. Meanwhile, Nanaue comes across small fish that mimic him, until their aquarium is broken and they begin to leech onto him, all while Bloodsport, Harley, and Polka Dot Man try to survive the crumbling facility. Bloodsport manages to survive going through several stories before he lands and witnesses Peacemaker getting ready to execute Ratcatcher. The two mercs draw their guns and fire their bullets at each other, with Bloodsport\'s bullet breaking through Peacemaker\'s and striking him in the throat, bringing him down.King Shark falls outside and is shot by Suarez\'s men, but he rises and bites the head off one gunmen before the rest of the Squad runs out of the facility as Starro bursts out. It releases more starfish that kill Suarez and his men and then proceeds to make its way into the city. Waller declares the mission over since the evidence is destroyed, but the surviving members want to save the city. Waller threatens to detonate their devices and kill them on the spot until her subordinate, Flo Crawley (Tinashe Kajese) brains her with a golf club and has the rest of the team guide the Squad to save the city. At the same time, Sol and her team execute the remaining members of the regime to stage their coup and take their country back.Bloodsport begins blasting away at Starro while King Shark goes ""nom nom"" on the alien and starts to bite into it. Polka Dot Man envisions Starro as his mother and unleashes his polka dots to burn Starro\'s leg, but the alien crushes him. Ratcatcher tries to use her beacon to summon the rats, but Bloodsport pushes her out of the way before she is killed. She then uses the beacon and gets practically every rat in the city to take down the infected citizens and start to take Starro down. Harley then charges into Starro\'s eye with the javelin and breaks through before the rats make their way inside and take Starro down from the inside, finally killing it and saving the city. The Squad\'s heroics are broadcast on the news, and Tyla acknowledges her father as a hero.Bloodsport contacts Waller, ordering her to let the team and Tyla go free, or they will leak the evidence from the laboratory to the press. She reluctantly agrees and calls for the chopper to bring them home. As the team rests, Sebastian crawls onto Bloodsport\'s leg, and he begins to pet the rat.Mid-Credits Scene: Weasel is shown to still be alive and starts wandering into the jungle of Corto Maltese.Post-Credits Scene: Waller\'s subordinates John Economos (Steve Agee) and Emilia Harcourt (Jennifer Holland) are brought to a room where they find that Peacemaker is still alive, because Waller needs him, as Harcourt puts it, ""to save the fucking world.""']"
23,MonsterVerse,Godzilla,831387,"['Remember \'Jaws\'? Remember the way you only got to see little glimpses of the shark or just the remains of his victims for nearly half the movie? Instead, you got to meet half the town first and all the main characters while fear and paranoia slowly spread across the whole community, and when the great white guy finally did make his entrance - boy, what an impact he had. Now, that was 40 years ago - but would it be possible to make that kind of movie today? To show restraint despite a budget of 160+ million dollars and all the latest state of the art CGI-effects the blockbuster factory has to offer?As it turns out, it\'s not quite possible; at least not as far as this latest version of \'Godzilla\' is concerned - but that\'s probably not for lack of trying on director Gareth Edwards\' part. The young director (\'Monsters\') has stated many times that \'Jaws\' was a huge inspiration for him on this movie, and it is hardly a coincidence that the (human) hero in \'Godzilla\' shares the same name with the hero in Spielberg\'s masterpiece (they\'re both called Brody).Edwards made it very clear that he wanted to take an ""old school"" approach - and as far as the beautiful, haunting build-up of the first half of the movie is concerned, he actually succeeds. The atmosphere of mystery and dread is tangible; the human element is there, the acting and the dialogues are solid, and the production design is breathtaking (especially the apocalyptic images of an evacuated city in Japan which was left to decay for 15 years, overgrown with plants and with packs of wild dogs running in the streets). The ""muto"" design - when we do get a first glimpse at a creature - is otherworldly and frightening (as good monsters should be), but as the movie progresses into the second half and the creature-action increases, the quality of the pacing, the dialogues and the acting inexplicably decreases. The movie sadly starts to feel flat, and although there is one great creature scene after another, and although those scenes get more and more intense as the storyline steers towards the inevitable showdown, it\'s hard to stay invested in the human side of the story.After the first act (when there was actually still some real acting required from the actors), there are virtually no interesting moments anymore when the human protagonists interact, let alone lingering scenes where the characters get to talk long enough to one another to even try to build such a thing as chemistry. So when the finale does arrive (which looks absolutely beautiful, by the way), you admire its epic scale, but since there is nobody to care about, it\'s hard to feel thrilled.Sure, you kind of root for Godzilla, but since you only just met the guy, you don\'t feel too much attached. Ultimately - despite a great build-up and a fantastic looking finale - \'Godzilla\' is a valid effort but only rarely a thrilling one. Unlike in \'Jaws\', there are no interesting human characters here who could help create the kind of tension-heavy atmosphere or sense of impending doom the way Chief Brody, Hooper and Quint could 40 years ago.Trying to show restraint alone is not enough to create a sense of wonder the way seventies cinema did - you also need the kind of character-driven scenes where someone says: ""We\'re gonna need a bigger boat!""Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/', ""You could describe this movie as Cloverfield meets Pacific Rim, because the evil enemies of Godzilla look so much like the alien in Cloverfield, while Godzilla behaves like the monsters from Pacific Rim only now Godzilla is the good guy.First, the special effects are good, the acting is not bad and the directing is a copy of Steven Spielberg's style.If you can see trough the many continuity errors, the complete meaningless character of Joe Brody and actually all the other characters and the other, many, many flaws in this movie and the absurd plot, you can enjoy it perfectly!! OK, for a movie called Godzilla, it's very confusing that the monster has little screen time, but when it has, it's just an action pack roller coaster. Just brainless entertainment, I can recommend this one."", 'If Jaws was released today, everyone would complain how it took too long for the shark to turn up. WHAT HAPPENED TO ATTENTION SPANS?!When I saw it in the cinema people couldn\'t even get through the opening credits without being on their phones. These are the same type of people who complain about how the human characters are dull (Yet the 1998 Godzilla characters were too ridiculous) but tell you off for saying the same thing about Pacific Rim, saying ""But I just want to see action""The people who complain about there being too little action also complain about how Transformers has too much action. The people who complain about Cranston not being in it enough complain about movies using popular actors just to get people to watch it. The people who complain about it being dark and realistic complain about the Marvel movies being too light and unrealistic.The people who complain about this movie are whiny, hypocritical and missed one of the most beautifully choreographed movies, with the most impressive visuals even when the monsters weren\'t on screen, a great soundtrack that inspired terror and a cast that although lacking in the third act, made up for a great introduction and middle (Cranston and Watanabe) and some of the most epic-scaled action I have seen in the last 10 years. Cloverfield was a shaky mess that wasted the monster and Pacific Rim had sporadic fights that gave no real sense of scale.I can\'t wait for the many sequels that will most likely have a lot more Godzilla now they are confident (given the box office)to use more CGI and money. He will be fighting some of the most iconic villains from the Godzilla universe, and hopefully all the idiots who watched and hated this movie won\'t watch it and me all the people who cheered through the first one will get to watch it in peace.', 'Scenario 1: If you are going to see this film because you really enjoy classic Godzilla movies and you hope the music and campy theme of those films are represented in this one, you absolutely should go see it. Godzilla here looks much more like the beloved behemoth than it did in the \'98 movie, the music hearkens to the classic Japanese overtures of the old Gojira film era, and the camera work has the comically silly nature of Sam Rami\'s Spiderman series.Scenario 2: If you are really excited to see a deep, human film with camera angles and writing that really tell a story that is thematically transcendent such as ""District 9"" and the Korean film ""The Host,"" this is not your film. The script is filled with overtly simplistic rhetoric and one dimensional characters (intentionally,) the scenes somehow manage to have very little tension (even for me, the pilot episodes for most sitcoms seem more tense than Gozilla,) and as stated above, the camera-work is intentionally hammy. It should also be noted that to add a human element, the director overuses children to the point that it ends up feeling very obvious, as though he did it to be intentionally campy.Scenario 3: If you are one of those people who really just want a fun popcorn flick such as Pacific Rim, with some solidly choreographed action like in the over-the-top bulletfest Battle:LA, I would say proceed with caution. The fight scenes are less intense and more majestic, like any classic monster movie, and as such the human aspect of the combat is relatively insignificant, less so than any other monster movie I\'ve ever seen. There are no little monsters for anyone to shoot at, if that\'s your thing.Scenario 4: If you are interested in this film because you love the talented work of Bryan Cranston, Ken Watanabe, and/or Aaron Taylor- Johnson (three of my favorite actors) and are excited to see what they bring to the table, you should probably sit this one out. Bryan Cranston\'s role in this film garners far less screen time than advertised, Ken Watanabe spends literally every second walking through the scenes with the pained expression of someone who just walked in on their parents, and all three of the actors give off the vibe that they are very much aware of how cheesy their lines are. Everyone else\'s performance was similarly forgettable.Honestly, I\'m a stickler for deep, human storytelling, but I\'ve also had a softspot for the classic, silly fun of many Godzilla movies, including my favorite, Godzilla vs. Destroyah. All told, depending on which camp you fall under, this will be an entirely different movie for you. As Godzilla movies go, I\'d give it a B. As darker, more serious monster movies go, I\'d give it a D+.', 'So, I should start by saying, I went to this move not expecting a lot. My husband wanted to see it, however, so off we go.. Dear Lord, I think I\'m going to find the sappiest chic flick available (even if its torturous for me to sit through) just to get payback for him making me sit through 2 hours of this crap. At least the popcorn was good!!I liked Godzilla himself.. But, I think out of the entire 123 minutes, you see him only 20 minutes, maybe? And most of that is just watching his spiky back in the water as he swims. The rest of this movie is watching the main actor, who, in my opinion, has about as much acting depth as Kristen Stewart, look like a total tool. The shining grace, I thought, was that this movie had Ken Watanabe in it. I like Watanabe but even he looked like he was suffering from a bad case of the Taco Bell revenge and couldn\'t find a bathroom for the entire movie.I spent the majority of this movie picking out dumb stuff that just amounts to bad writing. Example: Okay, the two bad monsters (which, in my opinion resemble a cross between those white strider things that the muppets ride in ""The Dark Crystal"" with a bit of ""Aliens"" thrown in to make them somewhat scary?) have the ability of creating EMPs, killing all electronics and causing aircraft to fall out of the sky.. We learn this early on in the movie, probably in the first 30 minutes. Think the military learns their lesson?? Nope, lets continuously throw about 600 billion dollars worth of F-35s and Battleships in the mix just so we can have it continuously plummet into the water. Another example: They know these muppet hybrids like to eat Radioactive materials and I guess can smell it. And hey, there\'s one making its way from Vegas to San Fransisco. So lets strap a huge bomb on a train and slowly move it from Vegas to San Fransisco along the same exact path that the critter is going. What kinda harm could that cause? Its not like the thing would smell it on the train and come after it, right? And why is it, the military storms into a radioactive storage facility but has no clue that an entire half of mountain has just been blasted out by muppet hybrid #2 (who\'s much bigger than #1) and this 30 story tall critter is somehow making its way towards Vegas completely undetected? And while we\'re on the subject of the bomb, what the heck is up with the ""breeding"" of the two muppet hybrids anyway?? You got a male, you got a female (complete with some glowy bulging egg sac thing that they give us a really good closeup of.. They meet up to reproduce.. which involves the male giving the female the long, phallic shaped, radioactive bomb which she then rubs between her legs all over this glowy egg sac.. WtF?? How the heck did these things breed before mankind started making huge phallic shaped missiles anyway? Oh..Did I mention the acting was bad?? I don\'t recall liking ANY of the characters, with exception to the dad (played by Bryan Cranston) and he dies within the first 20 minutes of the movie. There are characters that seem to have no purpose whatsoever besides trying to find a way to fill a 2 hour movie with irrelevant fluff. Lil Asian boy on the elevated train in Hawaii? Didn\'t see any point to him.. The main characters wife and little boy?? Added nothing to the story to be honest. (And what military wife who knows her husband is in danger isn\'t waiting by the phone for news? Nope, phones ringing and she\'s doing whatever.. Or tells her co-worker she\'s unavailable?) The acting had no depth to it, everyone came off very flat and honestly, unlikable. There\'s no emotion whatsoever. Hey, a couple of muppet hybrids are destroying our city, oh well. A huge Godzilla is barreling towards our aircraft carrier? Don\'t panic.. lets stand at the guardrail and watch it peacefully because any emotion such as fear would be too much to ask.Pretty sad when the most exciting thing about this movie is a bird hitting the bus window.. Although, to be honest, the CGI on the actual fight between Godzilla and the muppet hybrids was nice, the whole 5 minutes it lasted. Then, Godzilla jumps in the water and the credits roll. Best part of the whole movie.. Compared to the other 121 minutes of this movie, the credits are the best 2 minutes overall.', ""This film has no plot. I wouldn't have an issue with this if instead they had filled most of the two hours with scenes of Godzilla destroying things and killing people. However, the monster himself receives a pathetic amount of screen time, only appearing halfway through the film after the plot has already focused its attention on two giant bugs. They are unimaginatively designed, have no basis in Japanese mythology like the titular monster, and their only purpose seems to be to diminish the impressiveness of Godzilla. The character development in this film is non-existent. Every character, from the wise but ignored token Japanese bloke, to the soldier's wife whose sole purpose is to wait at home to comfort him, is a dull Hollywood cliché. Unlike the viewers, the film believes its characters are fascinating enough to merit the laughably corny near-death and family- reunion scenes towards the end. Instead, the audience is left laughing in bemusement at the overly sincere expressions on the protagonist's face as he threatens a giant monster with a handgun. Whenever Godzilla and the insects finally begin to fight, before anything happens there's an instant cut to yet another tedious shot of US soldiers shouting about nothing in particular. The film's sole purpose is to showcase the might of America's armed forces and ability to survive under a crisis; and it doesn't even do that well, given that the navy can't even tell when Godzilla is swimming directly under their ships. Of course, setting the story in Godzilla's homeland of Japan would not interest American viewers, so the monster decides to swim across the Pacific Ocean in order to wreak havoc. No doubt Godzilla will receive acclaim from morons due to its high-tech but utterly unimaginative animation techniques. However, this film's cutting-edge CGI does not justify its lack of plot, excitement and meaningful characters."", 'Godzilla has been a movie icon for over sixty years, emerging from the deep oceans and causing havoc in cities across the world. This new depiction of the great kaiju, acting as a reboot of the franchise and directed by an up-and-coming director, Gareth Edwards, is a very entertaining film despite the complaints of there being too little of Godzilla. I somewhat concur with this argument, however, having seen many of Japanese films, especially the original in 1954, it is known for Godzilla to be teased throughout the movie (or have limited screen time), yet still have a profound impact on the film and the audience it is delivered to, and this is what the 2014 version does very well. However, at times, it did come at an annoyance when right as we see him, the scene changes. But this should not take away from otherwise a really good film. The design of Godzilla and the monstrous villains, the MUTOs, were very well created and augmented to represent a respectable scale to real world buildings/infrastructure. As usual, the action scenes were a blast, with the final act dedicated to the fight we\'ve been waiting for between the creatures. The plot carried the film smoothly, coupled with some good acting from the likes of Bryan Cranston, Ken Watanabe, and David Strathairn. But it should be noted that the good acting came from secondary characters while our central character, Ford Brody, played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson, was very bland and one-dimensional. The film was an attempt at very human orientated monster film rather than focused on the monsters themselves, which is somewhat of a problem in a movie called ""Godzilla"". However, Gareth Edwards blends both well enough to not detract what this film manages to accomplish. With the news of a Monsterverse being created by Legendary Studious, involving the likes of King Kong, I am very excited to see where they take Godzilla in his next movie in 2019, where he will pit off against his greatest foes, King Ghidorah, Mothra, and Rodan, before taking on King Kong in 2020 to determine who the real ""King"" is.', ""Godzilla: Movie Review.Every time I see Godzilla roaring on screen it makes my mind blown away. The Cinematography, visual atmospheric style and whole tone and vibe of the movie is intense, astonishing and very well executed. The visual effects are spectacular and dazzling. Spectacle 3D and motion captures effects are fantastic. The cinematic story telling style of the film is phenomenal, immersive and impressive. The suspenseful, tense and mysterious build up is mind blowing. The fight and action sequences are well paced and breathtaking. There are some very creative and innovative sequences that are really amazing to watch on screen. The structure of the film is well balanced with exciting visceral thrilling scenes which are highly imaginative, compelling and convincing. The depiction and mythology of Godzilla both as hero and a monster is gripping, extraordinary and very fascinating.The last few minutes of epic showdown is very interesting, absorbing, artistic, awe-inspiring and very beautifully filmed and shot. The movie illustrates the power of the King of Monsters and the film captures Godzilla in all of its glory. Every time Godzilla is on screen the movie develops into a non stop thrill ride. The movie immerses its audience into the adventures of Godzilla which oozes brilliance in every scene it appears. The film is a visual marvel and brilliant in its conception and execution. The movie also explores the oppositional forces other than Godzilla and captures the essence of fear and visual beauty. The movie breathes life into the characterization of Godzilla and enchants itself with every element. The film is an extraordinary testament in its portrayal of the cultural icon of Godzilla. The movie accomplishes the difficult task of genre based film making.The direction of Gareth Edwards is good especially in regards to visuals and creating Godzilla action sequences. The main and major issue with the film is the very less screen time of Godzilla. This is really a major disappointment, because there is very less Godzilla in the film and Godzilla itself does't get enough screen time in its own film. The Human characters of the film are dull, boring and very underdeveloped. There is no emotional depth and intensity. Another major issue with the film is another major character that is the character of Bryan Cranston, also has a very less screen time. But, its the last superb fifteen minutes of the film that delivers something totally awesome.(Please Note: That This Review represent only my professional point of view and my personal honest opinion about the film, and does not represent others. Thank You)."", 'For fans of monster movies, ""Godzilla"" was surely one of the most anticipated releases of the year. Therefore, the most surprising thing about Godzilla is not how empty the story is, but rather how little there is of the monster in the movie after which it is named.The plot in ""Godzilla"" is disposable. It only exists as an excuse to unleash the film\'s titular character. However, is it too much to ask for an original plot with characters we could care about? Here, the back story is cliché-ridden and the characters simply serve the function of moving the story forwards. As such, one would expect that Godzilla is at least given ample screen time. Surprisingly, this is not the case, and the majority of the film\'s focus seems to be on the military attempting to find out how to kill Godzilla and the MUTOs, which look like giant, angry cockroaches. Ultimately, it is left up to the score and the Michael Bay-esque dub-step reminiscent sound design to create tension.Its almost futile to talk about the performances in the film because despite the strong cast, the characters are so one-dimensional that nobody delivers a memorable performance. Bryan Cranston and Juliette Binoche do their best with the little screen time they are given, and the couple of Aaron-Taylor Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen are given the impossible task of creating interesting characters from the uninspired script. More worrying, however, is how unnecessary Sally Hawkins\' character is and how the script manages to make Ken Watanabe look like a second-rate actor, as his character rarely changes expression from the looks of intense thought or surprise. Overall, ""Godzilla"" did not work for me at all. Not only is it a film without heart, but it a film meant to thrill that ends up just being tedious. I could have left halfway through the movie. I just didn\'t care how things would turn out.', 'I wasn\'t going to review this film, however, after reading mostly negative reviews, I felt I needed to put in my two cents worth. I am definitely in the minority on this one. I loved this film. It captured my attention instantly and held it for the entire two hours. Sure, the plot is familiar, but anyone who expects a new plot for one of the oldest, most famous monsters ever, is nothing but kidding themselves. This is a new version of some of the old ""Godzilla vs....."" movies. Not similar to the 1998 film in which one monster stomps around and destroys the city. Sure, that also happens here, but not without an epic battle between Godzilla and other radioactive monsters. Yes, most reviewers are complaining that Godzilla only appears for 10 minutes in the movie. This is true, as the other monsters have more screen time, but most of the film is built on suspense, and in my opinion it works very well. There is still plenty of chaos and destruction for the action buffs. The human story (about Ford Brody and his family) is quite weak and almost non-existent. But that does not take anything away from this epic monster movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it, it is VERY entertaining. 10/10', ""This isn't the usual kind of disaster action movie. It's a bit more serious and the disaster scenes aren't rushed. It's better to see this on a big screen because some of it is in the dark or under dusky skies.Effects are good not dizzying or overdone. The assorted monsters move naturally and are relatively realistic. The various locations from Japan to Hawaii are nicely done too though SanFrancisco could have been a bit brighter during the destruction. The Golden Gate and other landmarks aren't that precise but I get that things had to be spread out to accommodate the monsters.The basic plot isn't needlessly complicated though I got a bit lost in the details with the tactics to kill the monsters and the nuclear link to the monsters. The story about the people is secondary to the monsters which is good as it doesn't intrude.The main character played by a sensitive looking Aaron Taylor Johnson isn't some superhero type saving the day. He is more a in the thick of things observer which is refreshing for a change. No way out bravado here.Elisabeth Olsen isn't a drop dead gorgeous love interest, more every day ordinary. Her screen time isn't that much. Bryan Cranston (why didn't he age?) and Juliette Binoche (who did her hair?) also lend solid support.Ken Watanabe looks right for his part but his diction isn't clear enough for relaying the plot through dialog.Overall it's a good solid and well made big screen action disaster monster movie that deserves a big screen watch."", ""Finally sat down to watch this movie today. After all the hype it had had it's fair share of great moments but in the end felt something was missing. I'll agree with many that Godzilla wasn't shown as much as he should have and maybe that was what missing or maybe it wasn't. Needless to say even though Godzilla doesn't make many appearances in this movie it still is a rather good movie with a an interesting story line. The best way to go into this movie is to not buy into Hollywood's hype because if you go into it like that you will be disappointed greatly. Overall I was satisfied with Godzilla. Great story, special effects, and even the acting was pretty solid. Worth the 2 hours for sure. Sit back, grab some popcorn and beverage and enjoy!"", ""First I need to tell that I am from Central Europe. I am not writing reviews but I can't be silent. This was terrible. This was 1st time when after movie everybody was talking how bad it was. And everybody I mean whole cinema.First 20-30 minutes were watchable. It was looking to be a solid movie, but after that everything goes wrong. And I mean everything... Bad dialog's; good music in very bad moments and several styles of it; main character immortal; American happy ending style; no logic in this movie anywhere; many mistakes noticeable for everyone...If a Uwe Boll have more money, he will make this movie better. When I was watching Sharknado, I was less shocked by stupidity like in this movie. It is waste of your time and money and watch it only when you want to punish yourself."", ""I'm no great fan of summer blockbusters and for sure am resistant to the idea of paying over the odds to sit in a crowded room and be disappointed. This usually sees me picking up with such films when they are cheaper to get on rental and just watch in my own home. With Godzilla I will admit I was tempted to join for the spectacle because in addition to this the film had the appeal of quite a starry cast list in addition to being from Gareth Edwards, the man who famously made Monsters in his bedroom and on the fly. This suggested that perhaps there would be more to it than just effects and big money shots. That said, I had heard negative things and I did approach it with low expectations because after all, it is just a Godzilla movie.The film does try to create a human story to ground the audience and it casts wisely with Cranston, Binoche, Watanabe, Hawkins and others – all people who have a good presence in front of the camera. I was not to know that so many of the names that drew me to the project would be removed from the film pretty early on – a device that has impact for sure, but doesn't seem particularly brave since one suspects that the reason people like Cranston got onboard was that they were promised a lot for only relatively small parts. This leaves us with Taylor- Johnson and his quest to get home; a quest that never really interested me but at the same time is constantly pushed into the middle of the action no matter what or where it is. This saw my interest in the human side waning as the film progressed, leaving just the action.On this front the film pushes things as hard as it can. The makers clearly know their action genre because this is a film that understands that soldiers running with guns and speaking in tough military dialogue while music pumps in the background, can grab an audience – so it does it, lots. Considering I didn't care two hoots for them, I was surprised by how much time I spent watching soldiers sweeping areas with guns pointed – it did start to bore after a while. The monsters and their destruction is nicely hinted at first, but eventually the film plays all its cards and we have lots of action and knocking down of buildings. Unfortunately much of it plays out in darkness – something which helps the atmosphere but limits how much can be seen. Technically it looks good and the money is all up on the screen (in the darkness) but it is probably the noise that makes the most impact and even on a lesser system the roars and thuds of the monsters are engagingly meaty.Unfortunately this is really all that the film does, and it is quite uninvolving and unsatisfying. There is a lot of very good noise and big spectacle, but we have to experience through the human characters who we increasingly do not care about, and when the action really ramps up, it is detached from any sort of reality and I found myself appreciating the technical work rather than getting lost in what could have been dramatic and thrilling. As a blockbuster it probably has enough noise about it to be a distracting two hours if you have a good enough home entertainment value."", 'I saw the trailers for this a year ago while I attended a screening for Aronofsky\'s NOAH . I didn\'t fancy it much . GODZILLA conjures up memories of the big budget blandfest from a decade and a half ago . Just put some CGI on screen and voilà you\'ve a Summer blockbuster . This version did get a very good average rating when it opened , something in the region 8.1 but progressively got lower and it now has a rating of 6.6 indicating something average . To be fair I went in with an open mind and did find myself enjoying things more than I probably expected The original GODZILLA from 1954 was of a course a Japanese film that used the monster as a metaphor for the bomb . It did quickly abandon this subtext and just became a long running franchise where the titular monster got involved in all sorts of battles with other giant monsters . In its favour Gareth Edwards version of GODZILLA does keep the ethos of this . Radiation is very much to the fore of the story and while Godzilla might not be the hero he\'s certainly not the villain and this is reserved for ""Massive Unidentified Terreistial Organism"" a sort of hybrid between a giant praying mantis and a dragon . You know at one point they\'re going to be meeting in a climatic battle Of course two hours of giant CGI creatures getting in to a punch up isn\'t going to resonate with an audience so Edwards includes a very human backdrop as the story takes place through the eyes of serviceman Ford Brody . You got to love that name , it\'s sounds like a character John Wayne was born to play , a man\'s gotta do what a man\'s gotta do , get off your horse and drink your milk etc . It wasn\'t until I found out after seeing the film that I found out Brody is played by English actor Aaron Taylor-Johnson who I was totally convinced was one hundred per cent Uncle Sam . That said this isn\'t an actors type of film and I\'m speculating that the casting of Cranston and Binoche might have led to the backlash by many people . If you want to see Binoche try not to be blink because you will literally miss her . It\'s also difficult not to notice that there\'s a strong streak of manipulation as to how the characters play out . It\'s also yet another film where a little kid is used in a scene to keep the audiences emotions on tenterhooksRegardless of this people watch a film like GODZILLA for action set pieces and you can\'t really fault Edwards for what he\'s done here . He doesn\'t have a idiosyncratic quirk to his directorial style and the film does have that kind of Summer blockbuster look but he also previously directed MONSTERS and that movie featured a couple of aliens mating and here the MUTOs have a similar though much more shorter sequence . If you need a film calling for alien reproduction I can see Gareth Edwards being a natural auteur', ""This is one of the most terrible movie I've ever seen. A torture. I could barely stay still on my sit. I almost left the room 1 hour before the end. But I stayed, hoping for something good to happen. But something good never happened and the ending is even worst that my worst expectations.The trailer was such a lie. I was expecting something dark, mysterious and brainy. Something like The Dark Knight. Instead it's only military crap, dinosaurs fight and worthless American patriotism. Makes me sick. The movie dies with Bryan Cranston. The only problem is that his part doesn't last half an hour.Godzilla wasn't an earthquake. It wasn't a typhoon. It was just sh*t."", 'Where do I begin? Nothing in this movie works. The 3D effects are the worst I\'ve ever seen. In almost every major scene featuring the monsters, they appear completely flat and in the background, with one or two humans in the foreground in 3D. But the humans are so small (in a flawed attempt to convey the enormous scale of the monsters) that they just seem like silhouettes watching the same movie you are, as if somebody in the audience stood up to block the screen. It\'s almost as if the director pre-rendered the movie for Mystery Science Theater 3000... There are lots of other monster scenes where some minor object (broken window pane, windshield wiper, train passenger, etc.) gets in the way in a botched attempt to create depth. It never works - the monsters always seem fake and flat.Nothing about the plot makes any sense. We\'re to believe the monsters could completely obliterate a nuclear power plant without being noticed. Then, when they re-appear after 15 years (couldn\'t they have waited a few more years like the cicadas?), they can effortlessly elude radar tracking, satellite imagery, and a hundred million iPhones and just sneak around, silently munching on nuclear submarines. We\'re also to believe that nobody is really sure whether Godzilla is friend or foe, so the U.S. Navy will arbitrarily alternate between sailing right next to him and shooting at him with rockets. With all of the nuclear power plants in the country, which are like catnip to these suckers, somehow a major plot element involves luring the monsters away from population centers with a single nuclear weapon on a train.The score is so loud, intrusive, and overly dramatic it\'s mind-numbing.The M.U.T.O.s (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms) are as generic and uninspired as you could possibly imagine. Just think of every mantis-shaped bug you\'ve ever seen in any movie, and that\'s them. Throughout the entire movie I was distracted trying to remember where I\'d seen them before - and I just remembered, they\'re a rip-off from Starship Troopers.Every time a monster fight scene starts, it ends abruptly before anything interesting happens. In this movie, Honolulu, Las Vegas, and San Francisco supposedly get destroyed, but you can\'t really tell and won\'t really care. I think maybe 60 seconds was spent on the destruction of Honolulu and about 30 seconds on Las Vegas.The guy from Kick-Ass (I can\'t be bothered to look up his name) plays a giant walking cliché. So do half of the Olsen Twins (edit - it wasn\'t until I lost a bet over the cast of Avengers: Infinity War that I learned that Elizabeth Olsen is a sister of the Full House Twins, not one of them. Sorry Elizabeth. This movie still sucks). So do two - count \'em two - precocious endangered kids.The scene on the Golden Gate bridge is one of the dumbest I\'ve ever seen. I\'m pretty sure that bridge wasn\'t designed to hold a bunch of M1 tanks and - even if it was - they probably wouldn\'t be in a traffic jam with busloads of kids. I still can\'t figure out whether the bus driver was supposed to be a hero or a maniac for trying to mow down every pedestrian/soldier/policeman on the bridge just to save the walking cliché\'s son. And all those ships in the bay! Toy ships dropped in a bathtub would have a more organized formation.It doesn\'t really matter that Godzilla isn\'t in the movie that much. You\'ll just want the movie to be over. It doesn\'t matter that Bryan Cranston dies early on in the movie - you\'ll just want the movie to be over. It doesn\'t matter whether Admiral David Strathairn gets his SitReps from the TV news instead of looking out his window at the 600-foot-tall monster. You\'ll just want the movie to be over.It doesn\'t even matter that military people repeatedly ""pronounce out"" A.S.A.P. even though in real life they\'d probably just say ""AY-sap"". You\'ll just want the movie to be over A.S.A.F.P.I think what bothers me the most is the overuse of helicopters. I mean, I love helicopters. Blue Thunder is one of my favorite movies and Airwolf was my favorite TV show. I don\'t watch Westerns because there aren\'t enough helicopters in them. But the excessive use of helicopters in this movie made even me want to scream ""Enough with the helicopters, we get it, you can make them look 3D! Too bad you couldn\'t do that with the giant monsters!""Honestly, this latest installment of Godzilla is just as unwatchable as the Emmerich brothers\' fiasco, and even Godzilla 1985 was more interesting.To those positive reviewers who claim that it\'s not fair to compare this to Pacific Rim because they\'re different kinds of movies, I say: You are correct. Pacific Rim is an enjoyable, well done monster movie with good effects, and Godzilla is the exact opposite.', ""Being a fan who used to go to the movie theater in the 1960's to watch all those great (and cheesy) Godzilla movies. This new Godzilla movie is the Godzilla movie I have been waiting my whole life for. Not that 1998 SonyZilla that was so disappointing. But this movie, I know that all the long time fan's like myself will watch it over on over again. I will go back to the movies next week to see it again. Can't wait for the Blu- ray. I honestly do not see what all the haters of this movie are thinking. It's a Monster movie. Plain and simple. For 2 hours I was entertained. I went today to the IMAX with two good friends and their son's and we all liked the movie. No spoilers here so I will not discuss what happens in the movie but I was surprised by a few things. But that is what Gareth Edwards wanted. Why disagree. This movie kept me on the edge of my seat the whole movie. When GODZILLA shows up I just have one word. AWESOME! This is the Godzilla, all of us long time fans have been waiting for. And the MUTO's are really cool too. It must me sad to go to the movies and come out mad all the time. GO SEE THIS MOVIE. Any REAL FAN of GODZILLA will enjoy this movie and THE EFFORT IT TOOK TO MAKE IT. I cannot wait to see it again. LONG LIVE GODZILLA, KING OF THE MONSTERS!"", ""When this came out, people were upset that it did not have enough creatures in it. I agreed back then but now after the sequels I realize that Gareth Edwards was trying to focus on the story and not just a CGI fest. I really enjoyed Bryan Cranston's character and wish I could have more of that too. While I left wanting more, sometimes that is better than having too much."", ""Great comedy the monster thingy looked exactly like the old style Japanese versions like a person in a bad monster suit.No real story or plot after the Cranston character killed off,the first one wasn't perfect but far far better than this"", ""I can vividly remember the hype and anxieties surrounding Legendary making a new American Godzilla. Would they get it right? Would it be good? The result is a film that has the ingredients to be great although falls short in execution. The film's greatest success is in Godzilla's character, choosing to characterize him as a natural and eternal force of nature. While I'll always prefer Godzilla as a menace, for a big budget Hollywood blockbuster that meant to able to general audiences it works.Of course the human characters have been a point of debate for years. The ideas behind them are interesting although the actual execution is severely flawed. The first act does a great job in building up character and developing suspense only for the momentum to be lost with the removal of a certain character. It really handicaps the middle act although the climax is admittedly exciting and well done. Had the film not teased the action so much this probably would have been more forgivable although I do appreciate the restraint Edwards showed. The overall film is well made and has a grand sense of scale that makes one feel like you are truly caught in the midst's of the grand natural struggle. The film definitely has it's moments and I do appreciate this film for what it did as both a proper adaptation and as a good gateway entry for new fans."", ""Critics have lost their way. They have rated this film average/below average because they dislike the tease of Godzilla in the movie and say an improvement would be having him centre stage every scene he's in. When you look back to some of the greatest, most tense horror/sci-fi films like Jaws or Alien, you will see that they don't always show the creature from the start, but little snippets, building tension throughout the movie. They call this a B-movie because they enter the screening with the mindset that its cheesy because they don't understand the meaning behind Gojira itself, making it sound like just another monster movie when it's not. The fans are speaking out, showing their appreciation for the movie and love for the view Gareth is giving Godzilla, but the critics do not. Never listen to them; their opinions don't stand for the millions that actually GET what the director was trying to establish here.Also, if you're a monster movie type of person, go see this. If you're not, don't go see it. It is that simple. Don't go judging on how bad an actor is in a film when you can't even memorize a single line. Don't go writing a review that is completely biased just because you do not know the concept and origin of Godzilla. Half of these reviews are trolls anyway so it is best to ignore them (and including me if I sound ignorant). If you like monsters or Godzilla, go see it and make up your mind. If you don't, then spend your money on something else."", ""It is my first review..I waited this movie since announcement.Since movie's release i checked RT score and metacritic.Some were disappointed.Maybe they are not monster kind person. First in IMDb it was 9.3 ,when i checked.After that it started decreasing. In 16th of my i immediately bought a ticket and went to watch it.Unfortunately in my city there is no IMAX 3d theater ,so i handled real 3d. When movie started first part was kinda drama. Bryan Cranston acted perfectly.Maybe he will be nominated for best actor in supporting role.Emotional part describes history of Godzilla and arising new MUTOS.After first break action part was just stunning.I was amazed by CGI and sound effects. Roar of Godzilla and other monsters makes you thrill.In movie i think i saw Godzilla just about 20-30 minutes, but when i saw ,it was cool.That few minutes was enough for my expectations..(sorry for my English mistakes)"", 'Old memories never die. I was living in Tokyo in 1954 the year that Godzilla first appeared and destroyed most of the City. It is something that I have never forgotten to this day. OK I know this guy is nuts. I was not even alive in 1954. I saw the Movie when it came out Thursday Night and had to sleep on it. After absorbing it all in I think I can say that I really liked the Movie and think that most Movie goers especially hard core Godzilla fans will like this Movie. Give it a shot and see what you think. I have seen every Godzilla Movie that I can get my hands on and think that this may be my favourite. Now we will have to wait and see if they will recycle any of the other Japanese Monsters. Gamera, Mothra or any others.', 'In my opinion, this movie was insane. Godzilla was not really that much in the movie, but when he was he kicked ass!I don\'t understand people bitching about the movie wasn\'t like pacific rim. I liked Pacific rim, but i think it was a good idea to make something different. This monsterfilm is much more realistic, and is much, much better made (CGI). In my opinion Godzilla was way better than Pacific rim.Bryan Cranston appears in the trailer like he is the main character but he dies in the beginning of the movie, which i think is really misleading. He\'s son takes the spot, and must travel from Japan to U.S.A to get his family away from the danger. The son (Ford Brody) is a very boring character because we don\'t see him so much and he doesn\'t seem very sensitive.In the end Godzilla actually saved mankind and just go in to the ocean and swim away, which i think was a really unpredictable ending.So don\'t watch this movie if you just want some meaningless monsterfight. Watch it because you wanna se a ""realistic"" movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat - With monsters in it.And this was the best CGI i have ever seen in a movie.(Godzilla has atomic breath)', 'Opening credit sequence rolls over archive footage of nuclear tests in the 1950s. Extra information in the opening credits is redacted with strips of white. Nuclear bombs are going off, military personnel are slipping on protective eye-wear, and ominous Godzilla spines briefly emerge from beneath the waves. They are trying to kill Godzilla. It doesn\'t work and he screams his disapproval.In 1999 a helicopter bearing the name ""Monarch"" glides over a huge excavation in the Philippines. It looks like a open pit mine. Thousands of workers labor in the massive trenches. As the \'copter lands, a Japanese researcher named Ichiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) and his British assistant Vivienne Graham (Sally Hawkins) emerge. An American supervisor informs them that they had readings that suggested a uranium find. They loaded heavy equipment onto the site, only for it to collapse into an underground cavern. They head there to find the skeletonized carcass of a massive creature, one that fills the cave as far as the eye can see.Hanging from the cave ceiling appears to be a cocoon of some type, as well as one that looks like it has hatched. Going further into the cave, it looks as though some enormous thing has crawled from the cave and torn a wound across the landscape as it headed toward the sea. Serizawa and Graham puzzle over what could have emerged from the cocoon.In Japan, at the Janjira nuclear power facility, Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) is on the phone frantically concerned about local seismic activity. He thinks the power plant should be shut down as a precaution. As an American, he is concerned about ruffling Japanese feathers, but insists on a meeting to air his concerns. His somewhat shy son has made a sign for him. It\'s his birthday. His wife, Sandy (Juliette Binoche), hustles the son off to school. She reminds Brody that it\'s his birthday and his son, Ford, had prepared a surprise. They head off to the plant and he tells his wife to head down into the reactor zone to make sure nothing has been damaged by the shaking.Once at the plant, Brody makes his case. His superiors think the activity is just aftershocks from the recent Philippine ""earthquakes."" Brody says that the seismic readout on a computer display is unusual & couldn\'t possibly be just an earthquake. One of his assistants tells him that the increase in seismic rumblings has been recorded in hours, not days. Suddenly, a major tremor hits the plant. Brody yells: ""We need to shut down now!"" Before the process can even begin, another shaker rocks the plant, triggering red lights all over the place. The reactor has been breached and Brody\'s wife is down there.Brody races downstairs, demanding that the protective shield door be kept on manual override so he can save his wife. Sandy and her team run full tilt trying to stay ahead of a radioactive cloud rushing through the tunnels that will kill them despite their protective suits. They are making good time until a teammate stumbles and Sandy stops to assist him.Meanwhile, Brody has arrived at the door and confirmed that he has control. He gets a walkie talkie message that Sandy is done for. Brody is overcome with emotion, literally shaking at the prospect of losing her. She tells him that he needs to shut the door to save the city. He waits until the last possible moment, then seals the door and their fates. Literally seconds after the primary door has been sealed, Sandy appears with several of her team. Brody weeps as he watches his wife being bathed in the toxic radioactive mist as the secondary door closes.At his school, little Ford Brody (CJ Adams) witnesses the plant\'s cooling towers collapsing as he\'s being evacuated. He knows that his parents work there. All his classmates flee outside while he watches his entire life collapse into ruin.In the present day, an adult Lt. Ford Brody (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) is returning home after 14 months at sea in the US Navy to his wife Elle (Elizabeth Olsen) and their young son Sam (Carson Bolde) in San Francisco. There\'s a sweet \'Welcome Home\' scene and Ford prepares for some long overdue mommy/daddy time when the phone rings. Ford learns from someone on the line that his estranged father, Joe Brody, has been arrested in Japan for trespassing and is being held by the police. Ford leaves to meet his father.In Tokyo Ford is obviously disappointed at having to bail out his dad. Joe suffered a nervous breakdown after the accident and their relationship is clearly strained. Joe\'s small apartment looks like a conspiracy theorist\'s paradise. Pictures and articles paper the walls. Stacks of books and research are everywhere. Clearly his dad has become obsessed with the accident at Janjira. He\'s mumbling about echolocation and earthquakes ""talking to each other."" Out of pity, Ford suggests that his dad come home with him. Joe hasn\'t seen his grandson in years and desperately needs a break. Joe, however, is adamant about continuing his investigation: he needs to know what happened that day. His wife is still buried in the rubble of the ""quarantine zone."" He mentions that he needs to get back to his house to retrieve his research and sadly shares that he doesn\'t even have a picture of his wife to cherish.Begrudgingly, Ford decides to help his dad. They head back to the old neighborhood, which looks abandoned and overrun. Suddenly, a pack of dogs gambols through the scene. How could that happen in a radioactive wasteland? Joe checks his Geiger counter which shows no radiation at all. Impulsively, he snatches off his protective headgear and breathes deeply, proving the air is completely safe. Ford is becoming convinced that something is amiss here. They rummage through the house and Joe grabs his 3.5 inch ZIP discs. He finds a picture of Sandy and turns to see Ford\'s birthday sign, still strung up after all these years. Meanwhile, Ford finds an old army toy soldier that he pockets.The beating of helicopter blades shakes them from their reverie. As they head outside, they\'re immediately scooped up by Japanese-speaking security guards and driven to the ""abandoned"" nuclear plant. Serizawa and Graham are talking with some others. They are concerned about activity surrounding an odd cone-shaped organic structure protruding from the surface of the old reactor. Someone interrupts them to say they need to come with him. They are taken to where Joe is being interrogated. He comes across as manic and a little loopy, but Graham confirms that his data is strikingly similar to what they\'re seeing now. He\'s the only one left who knows what happened 15 years ago and demands to see his son and get answers regarding the disaster that killed his wife.Back in the main room, the readings confirm that EMP pulses are knocking out their electronics with alarming frequency... just like in 1999. Serizawa concedes that it\'s time to kill the program. A steel containment net is lowered and millions of watts of electricity are applied to the chrysalis -- the massive jolt of electricity appears to destroy the organic pod and the light that pulsated in it dies out. Suddenly, a massive multi-legged creature cracks out of the shell and pounds its clawed leg on the ground, creating an EMP pulse that kills all power in the facility, releasing Joe from his confinement in the process. People are screaming and running as the creature strains against its enclosure. Meanwhile Ford is still handcuffed in a security vehicle. He watches helplessly as people are slaughtered around him. Suddenly, a support smashes the detainment vehicle he was trapped in and he\'s free. Joe watches in horror from an elevated walkway as his son faces death. But his own safety is in jeopardy as the bridge is demolished and he tumbles in a horrible fall. Ford dons a gas mask and looks up just in time to see the creature unfurl giant wings and fly off.The next day, Captain Russell Hampton (Richard T. Jones) informs Serizawa that the U.S. military is taking over. He asks Serizawa who he needs on his team. He points to Joe, bandaged and on a stretcher. They take Joe and Ford in a military transport. Unfortunately, Joe doesn\'t survive for long. Serizawa and the others turn to Ford, asking him if he knows anything about his father\'s findings. Ford is reluctant to comment on his father\'s obsessive behavior but remembers something about echolocation. Serizawa clues into this, brings Ford into a briefing room, and explains to Ford that the recently hatched ""MUTO"" (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism) may be trying to communicate with another giant monster that was found roaming the Pacific a long long time ago. Serizawa then presents the same vintage nuclear test footage from 1954 that we see in the opening credits, but with a few crucial details included, mainly a few frames of a familiar giant spiny creature. Serizawa explains that the nuclear tests weren\'t tests; they were attempts to kill this creature. This creature had been named ""Godzilla"", and Serizawa is convinced he is returning, a feeling that is soon confirmed when he is spotted soon thereafter. The naval fleet follows Godzilla. Meanwhile, Elle freaks out about the news coverage of the Japan damage and can\'t reach Ford.Since Ford doesn\'t have much to offer, he\'s put on a helicopter headed to Hawaii for a flight back home. The Navy confirms that the MUTO is headed across the Pacific. The fleet heads in that direction, flanking Godzilla\'s spines, which are heading in the same direction. Serizawa posits that Godzilla is tracking the MUTO and wants to fight it to restore balance to nature.In Honolulu, Ford is at the airport, waiting for the train to his terminal. He\'s playing with the toy solider and a little Japanese boy becomes fascinated with it. As the boy wanders onto the train without his parents and the doors close. They freak out, but Ford mouths that he will being their boy back. He hopes that he won\'t miss his flight.Back to the carrier ship, they\'ve heard that the Russians are missing a nuclear sub. The MUTO eats radiation (which is why the nuclear plant was free of toxic waste). It may have taken the sub as a meal. They send a team into the forest near Honolulu to investigate. The team finds the sub, covered in gooey slime and stuck in a tree. The MUTO is snacking on nuclear fuel canisters. An airborne attack is launched, but the MUTO fires its EMP, knocking out all navigation controls for the jets and sending them plummeting to earth. At the airport, power is knocked out, including power to the train at the airport. Ford doesn\'t realize that the MUTO has caused the outage and assures the little boy that the power will come back soon.At a hotel luau, a little girl sees the explosion of the planes in the far-off hills. The crowd is becoming worried as the little girl notices that the sea water seems to be receding from the shore at a rapid pace. Something is displacing an immense amount of water.Very quickly, we see that the thing moving all that water is Godzilla. Honolulu is flooded as the beast reaches ground. The luau (and everything else downtown) are flooded. At the airport, power is restored, but reveals the MUTO has reached the elevated tracks and the train is headed straight into its jaws. The behemoth shreds the track, sending passengers to their doom. Ford barely hangs on, grabbing the kid before he slides out of the mangled train. Godzilla squares off against the MUTO, but it manages to escape, flapping its giant wings and continuing its journey to the mainland.Back in San Francisco, Elle is asking her son to go to bed as he watches the developing destruction on the news. The whole world now knows that the MUTO and Godzilla exist.Back on the ship, they\'re tracking the MUTO\'s path. Looks like it\'s headed to San Francisco. Graham and Serizawa realize that it must be headed to the other MUTO, long-thought dead. Unfortunately, the dangerously radioactive body has been stored in the midst of an unlimited food supply: the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste facility in Nevada. Troops arrive to discover that the MUTO, now confirmed as a female, has escaped and is making a path to meet her mate. The path leads directly through Las Vegas. The second MUTO is much larger and more powerful than the first and lumbers straight through Las Vegas, destroying whatever lies in it\'s path.The Navy has hatched a plan to lure the two MUTOs off shore with a nuclear missile. Godzilla will be close behind. Then they\'ll detonate the bomb, wiping out all three monsters. Graham is amazed at the short-sightedness of the plan. Because the MUTOs eat radiation, she and Serizawa believe the plan won\'t work. Captain Hampton claims that nothing can survive the power of the newer bombs. Serizawa isn\'t convinced.Meanwhile, after delivering the boy to his parents in devastated Honolulu, Ford hops onto a Navy transport headed to the mainland. A train is being prepared to transport the two weapons (the bait and the killer bomb). Ford shoehorns himself into the detail, citing his expertise in ordnance handling. The bombs will be transported by train to the coast where the plan will be set into motion. Things seems to be going just fine until a tremor stops the train right before a treacherous mountain bridge. The team attempts to radio ahead, but the screams over the walkie don\'t bring good news. Uncertain if the bridge is even there, they break into two groups. It looks OK at first, but the female MUTO has been lying in wait. It smashes the bridge, gobbles down one of the nukes, and kills everybody on the train (except for Ford, who jumps into the river just as the bridge is shattered).By morning, a recovery team has found Ford and the nuke. They\'ll fly the remaining bomb and try to make do with a modification of the initial idea. The President approves. Serizawa comments on the arrogance of man (thinking that we can control nature when it\'s the other way around).The two MUTOs are headed for their reunion in San Francisco, with Godzilla in close pursuit. The Navy has been tacitly tolerating the monster as it has expressed no direct threat to the ships, but they are committed to destroying them all despite Serizawa\'s protests. Ford has called Elle at the hospital to assure her he\'s on his way, and asks her to please wait for him. Meanwhile, the whole city is prepping for an emergency evacuation. Elle wants to keep her son with her, but relents, trusting his care to a co-worker. Evacuation buses are stalled on the Golden Gate bridge as troops in tanks position themselves against the kaiju threat.The Navy has rigged the bomb with an analog countdown timer (to avoid being disabled by MUTO\'s EMP). They set the clock when a winged MUTO attacks. He\'s looking for a snack for his mate and delivers the bomb to her. The larger MUTO tears up part of Chinatown make a nest for their offspring; the nuke will offer nutrition until they hatch. Godzilla, sensing his prey, emerges from the depths right by the Golden Gate Bridge. The troops attack instinctively, inciting Godzilla to tear through the bridge. The bus driver sees his chance and barrels through barricades to take his charges to safety.Ford, though injured, claims he can disarm the trigger in about 60 seconds. He\'s on the team for a risky HALO jump into San Francisco to grab the bomb, defuse it, and make one last try to blow the monsters to smithereens.They make the jump, only losing a couple of guys when Godzilla shows up ready to fight the monsters. Godzilla is doing pretty well against the smaller, winged male, but when the big female leaves the nest to help, they join up to attack Godzilla. The troops have found the nest and the nuke, but the the casing is damaged and they can\'t disarm it there. They begin to move it to a boat where they have more tools and can send it away from the city...The fight between the giants continues in the city where the MUTOs are ruthlessly jabbing their hooks into Godzilla\'s massive body. He looks done for but continues to fight them.Back at the nest, Ford sees thousands of eggs and realizes they\'re an even bigger threat. Lagging behind, he pops off the covers on spouts from a destroyed tanker truck to flood the chamber with gasoline.Godzilla\'s fight with the MUTOs seems to be turning to his enemies\' advantage: he\'s been mangled by the MUTOs, when suddenly the nest explodes, destroying all the eggs and sending the female screaming back to the nest in a panic. This is just the break Godzilla needs. He gets his second wind and re-engages with the flying MUTO. Air superiority appears to give MUTO an edge, but Godzilla\'s long spiked tail knocks the MUTO into a building, killing it.Meanwhile, Ford has been caught in the aftershock of the explosion. The female MUTO grieves the loss of the babies, but smells the nuke and heads back to grab it. The female seems to notice Ford and leans menacingly close to him when Godzilla suddenly reappears and his spinal crest begins to glow blue. The beast lets loose with an enormous blast of radiation breath at the female MUTO, driving it back. He continues to fight it hand-to-hand.The team reaches the ship and tries to make for open water, but an EMP from the female MUTO kills the engines. The troops valiantly try to save the mission, but the beast arrives and starts ripping them to shreds. As the monster turns to attack some troops on shore, Ford goes to the boat to disarm the bomb. The casing is too far gone and the female MUTO sets her sights on his tiny vessel. Suddenly, Godzilla stealthily sneaks and grabs mama MUTO by the throat. Ripping her jaws open, he fires an atomic fire blast down her throat, incinerating the beast and tearing her head off. Finally, Godzilla succumbs to its injuries and collapses on the shore.Meanwhile the ship\'s power sputters back to life and Ford directs the GPS to take the ship into the bay. There\'s no time to disarm it now. He falls to the deck, seemingly accepting of his fate. A blinking light draws him back into consciousness as a med-evac helicopter lifts him to safety. In the distance, the auto-piloted boat erupts into an nuclear explosion, safely away from the city.In the aftermath, the badly-injured corpse of Godzilla lies in the streets of San Francisco. Ford is limping through a hastily converted stadium shelter. He has found his son, but emergency teams are still attempting to rescue folks from the hospital that was demolished in the kaiju battle, and Elle is still missing. Suddenly, son sees Elle and she sees Ford and they hug... reunited and threat averted.Meanwhile, Serizawa looks with regret on the still body of the great beast. Suddenly, it snorts into motion, slowly righting itself and lumbering through the streets toward the water. Serizawa smiles, happy that this mighty force of nature has survived. News reports announce that the ""King of Monsters Saved the City!"" Godzilla then dives back into the water and swims away into the ocean.']"
24,MonsterVerse,Kong: Skull Island,3731562,"[""This King Kong story has the big guy never leaving Skull Island. But with Brie Larson along the big guy still has an eye for the ladies though he never becomes obsessed like he was with Fay Wray. It's the end of the Vietnam War, but John Goodman who's a Frank Buck type hunter and explorer with some Capitol Hill influence has gotten the government to underwrite an expedition to a newly discovered uncharted island. He's even gotten the cooperation of the government in this endeavor. An airborne squadron of paratroopers headed by Colonel Samuel L. Jackson are to give him support. These troops ain't real happy as their going stateside is being delayed.This island has all kinds of strange monsters, prehistoric hunter/gatherers. and a big ape who watches over the people and the walled stockade they've built to prevent them from being the lunch special for the monsters. They will need all that military firepower to stay alive and as you can gather very few make it out alive.One thing though, this ain't Jurassic Park where a lot of plant eating dinosaurs are around. Everybody here is a flesh eater. No wonder that vegetation is so lush and so treacherous.Kong: Skull Island I suspect will get a nomination or two in the technical categories next year. It's your old fashioned action/adventure saga where everyone looks like they're having a good time making it. The acting sure shows it."", ""KONG: SKULL ISLAND is a Hollywood blockbuster intended as a prequel for a forthcoming KING KONG VS. GODZILLA remake along with lots of other upcoming monster mayhem. Thankfully, this does away with the usual nonsense business of yet another KING KONG remake; the action is set entirely on Skull Island and there's none of that sappy romance between the giant ape and a human female. In terms of quality, it's a real mixed bag, one which gets by thanks to the big scale CGI action sequences in which Kong battles various giant enemies. Kaiju fans will be happy, and the post-credits coda is the icing on the cake.The human cast fare less well here, with a wooden Tom Hiddleston failing to make any kind of impact and Samuel L. Jackson overacting in a predictable role. John C. Reilly bags the only real characterisation while others like Toby Kebbell and Jing Tian are wasted. The worst actor of the whole thing is Brie Larson, whose wide-eyed reaction shots are an example of ridiculous, and quite embarrassing, overacting. The overload of CGI does get wearying at times, and the film is occasionally laughable, what with the CGI deer and helicopters in proliferation, but otherwise it's typical brainless entertainment that keeps you distracted for its running time."", ""Kong: Skull Island (2017)*** (out of 4)A monster hunter (John Goodman) leads an expedition onto Skull Island where they come across various monsters including the mightiest of them all: King Kong.KONG: SKULL ISLAND is an attempt to get the giant monster back onto the big screen and it was obviously trying to get everything set up for future films. Look, nothing will ever beat the original KING KONG, although I did enjoy the first remake and even films like KING KONG VS. GODZILLA. With that said, I found the Peter Jackson film to be downright terrible and when I walked into this movie I was just hoping for something better than it. Thankfully, KONG: SKULL ISLAND is much better than that as long as you turn your brain off at the door.I thought for the most part the film worked quite well. For starters, the filmmakers appeared to realize that what movie fans want are giant monsters who battle one another. You don't have to wait too long for the first glimpse of Kong and this here is a major plus. Once we reach the island is when all of the fun starts and it really goes for the throat as there's a very fun adventure on the island. I'm obviously not going to spoil everything that happens but the entire running time takes place on the island and this leads to some very fun monster battles.There's no question that the best thing about this picture are the monsters including Kong. Yes, the King Kong is CGI but he looks terrific and very realistic. I thought the entire creation was an extremely good one and the film perfectly allows you to believe that what you're seeing is real. The other monsters also look terrific and I thought the filmmakers really nailed the look of the monsters. The battle scenes are certainly a lot of fun and especially the final one where Kong must go up against something much bigger than him.As far as the cast goes, no one is spectacular but they're at least fun. Tom Hiddleston is a pretty laid back lead but he does fine. John C. Reilly and Samuel L. Jackson are both good, although they're both pretty much playing the type of character we've seen them do countless times before. Goodman is fun when he's on the screen. The only real dud is Brie Larson as the photographer. She's good in the film but I must say it's a pretty bland and boring part and especially coming after winning an Oscar for ROOM.Technically speaking the film is quite impressive and we've got a rousing score to go with everything. The plot is certainly very simple but I'm actually glad. I mean, I've never believed these types of movies need to clock in at two and a half hours. This one is just under two-hours and that's the perfect time for this type of action movie."", ""It's 1973. Bill Randa (John Goodman) convinces a senator to fund his expedition to an unexplored island with expert tracker James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston) and documentarian Mason Weaver (Brie Larson). Bill hires Preston Packard (Samuel L. Jackson) and his soldiers who are finished with the war. They are flying helicopters dropping explosive charges to map the island when Kong shows up to bring them down. Some of the survivors encounter natives and Hank Marlow (John C. Reilly) who crashed during WWII.There are some good monster action. The characters are mostly one-dimensional. The start is a bit meandering. It's thirty minutes before getting to the island. Fifteen minutes is plenty. I don't care about Randa's backstory or the political backdrop of the situation. John C. Reilly is off trying to do comedy by himself. Kong lacks the needed humanity. The best is the monster action and Kong fits well in that aspect. The giant spider is amazing creepiness. The movie needs more of those types of thrills. This is an old-fashion monster movie with state of the art effects."", 'I can\'t contribute much here because most of the nay-sayers have already said ""Nay."" First of all, we have no real idea why the government would ante up for this ludicrous venture. Once the Senator decides to go along with it, a truly idiotic array of cannon fodder and expensive helicopters head off, not knowing a thing about their reason for doing so. The early scene of Kong destroying the copters is asinine. Once he grabbed the first chopper, the rest of the pilots should have backed off and figured things out. Kong\'s arms are long but about 30 feet would have put them out of harm\'s way. There is so much that goes unexplained in this thing and so many plot holes, it\'s hard to get into it. Sam Jackson plays the same part he has played about sixteen times (were there any snakes in those helicopters?). The rest of the stiff acting company does nothing to develop any sort of connection for us. Even the hero guy is about as boring as one can be. I could go on, but others have already poked holes in it enough.', 'admirable cinematography. decent story. decent acting. old recipes and few references to the adaptations. important - to say a coherent story, predictable in few moments but nice and not so bad. because it is an action film and, not surprising, it respects the rules of genre, with few small oasis of humor. sure, it has a precise target. sure, it is first step for an expected series. and this did it one of films who remains as good try to give something different by the contemporary blockbusters, maybe at the level of nuances. so, decent work.', ""These horrible Vietnam War soldiers deserve what they get when they land on Skull Island and face the gigantic ape, invading his land with war games and surprised when monkey sees, monkey does. Its worth seeing simply for the CGI but the story is ridiculously awful and shows that Hollywood really doesn't like to work on character development, just special effects to bring in the teen audience who has no idea of what a good film is even if they are the target audience who buys tickets for everything high tech. Certainly the natural environment is gorgeous, but when it starts to catch on fire when these destructive jerks arrive and turn paradise into hell.The dialogue is totally ridiculous, totally cliched and showing that these characters had no more development than names on a page and were subject to the whims of the special effects men. Well known actors like Samuel L. Jackson, John Goodman and John C. Reilly might give it some marquee value for older film fans, but this is a type of brainless film that you go in, eat your weight in popcorn and wait for Monster to arrive. You get giant mammals, a hideously ugly huge spider and of course, which is 3 times bigger than the original Kong of 1933. The attempts at intentional humor fail miserably, and I found myself laughing at unintentionally humorous moments. I can say that I didn't feel that I wasted much time with this, but I also felt I didn't get a good film either."", ""By the setting Kong : Skull island in the 1973 the film gets to dovetail the aftermath of the Vietnam conflict onto the plot.The film begins with William Randa (John Goodman) and Houston Brooks (Corey Hawkins) trying to get government funding for an expedition to the unknown Skull Island who they have satellite images of for the first time. They recruit a former British special ops James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston) as a guide and photographer Mason Weaver (Brie Larson) for the expedition.Lt Colonel Preston Packard (Samuel L. Jackson) and his team of soldiers are the military escort. Packard is upset with the withdrawal of troops from Vietnam leading what the fighting was for and what to do afterwards. This mission gives him purpose but as they arrive in their helicopters to Skull Island and start dropping bombs as part of scientific tests, they are attacked by the giant Kong who destroys the choppers and kills most of the men. Packard wants vengeance against Kong.Meanwhile Conrad and Weaver discover Hank Marlow (John C Reilly) a soldier from World War 2 who crash landed and resides with the natives in the island. Marlow explains that Kong is regarded as a god by the natives and he is their protector as the island has other monsters especially those underground that only Kong can take on.Kong: Skull Island neatly reworks elements of the King Kong story. We have the helicopter attack at the early part of the story leading to Packard becoming a sworn enemy of Kong. Of course Packard is crazy whose motivations are nonsense. It was he and his men who have invaded Kong's turf and started bombing it which has awaken the underground monsters. You get some mumbo jumbo about superiority of men while they are being killed by giant spiders and lizard creatures.It is an entertaining action adventure with a ludicrous story. At least you root for Kong and he does keep the story going. The special effects are very good and you gets all sorts of nasty creatures in the island which again is a call back to the original King Kong.The film really is unsure what to do with some of the leads. Larson is only there to be the tentative love interest to Hiddleston and bring out Kong's tender side. At least she fares better than the Chinese actress Tian Jing who as the other female is there just to keep the Chinese co-producers happy, she certainly has little to do in this film. Even Hiddleston's action man role is curtailed somewhat."", 'When the Vietnam War ends, Bill Randa (John Goodman) and his partner Houston Brooks (Corey Hawkins) from the Monarch organization succeed to get the financing for an expedition to the recently discovered Skull Island from Senator Willis (Richard Jenkins). He hires the former Captain James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston) to guide the expedition; a group of soldiers under the command of Colonel Preston Packard (Samuel L. Jackson); and the awarded journalist and photographer Mason Weaver (Brie Larson). On the arrival, the helicopters need to cross a storm and soon they drop bombs on the forest to map the seismology of the island. Soon they are attacked by a huge gorilla called Kong that destroys the helicopters and kills part of the crew and scatter the rest through the island. The group commanded by Conrad meets Hank Marlow (John C. Reilly), a survivor from the World War II that lives with a tribe of natives. He explains that Kong protects the island and the natives from underground monsters and shall not be killed. But Colonel Packard is insane seeking revenge for his men that died.""Kong: Skull Island"" is a brainless adventure with several stupidities. For example, the number of helicopters in the beginning of the journey of Randa, Conrad and Packard is totally incompatible with the size of their ship. Bo pilot would dare to cross a storm like that in a helicopter. The attack of all the helicopters to Kong is absolutely imbecile. Most of the survivor\'s attitude are at least unreasonable. On the other side, the adventure is highly entertaining and the special effects are top notch. Therefore the best option to the viewer is to shut down the brain and enjoy the adventure since this is the purpose of this type of blockbuster. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Kong: A Ilha da Caveira"" (""Kong: The Skull Island"")', ""Looking back at old movies, the effects date quickly and they become rather cheesy in their simple pleasures. Someday I will do that with this film, because essentially it is a creature feature, albeit one that happens to be being delivered with the biggest stars, biggest budget, and state-of-the-art effects. And the thing is, despite all this superficial polish, the film is essentially big monsters and spectacle.On this front it is enjoyable though; it has plenty of action, lots to look at, and a reasonably successful mix of humor and drama. I say reasonably, because the plot isn't up to much, and different characters seem to be in different films depending on who they are. This is matched by the performances which range from the silly fun (Reilly) to the stupidly OTT (Jackson) to the starry but bland (Hiddleston, Larson); the film doesn't seem to have a handle on what it wants to do, and the mix that it produces is not always successful, and it relies on big moments of action and noise to try and cover it. Perhaps at some point there was some smart commentary about US foreign policy in there, but that is lost in the mix too.Still, it works as a monster movie with great effects and lots of polish, so enjoy it for that even if there is not too much beyond that."", 'This film takes place in the early 1970\'s complete with era music. John Goodman revives his role from ""Cloverfield 10"" as an alternate reality type of guy. He convinces a senator to give his expedition backing and a military escort to the recently discovered Skull Island, before the Russians get there. He is aided by tracker James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston) and a military escort lead by Colonel Preston Packard (Samuel L. Jackson). Brie Larson tags along as a photographer and contrast to other Kong film leading ladies.This film is not a beauty and the beast film as was the original. The island is an opening to an underworld with prehistoric animals as you soon find out. The film does include the expected cage match between Kong and the uglier Samuel L. Jackson. Set in the Vietnam withdraw era, there is a universal theme associated with the film of ""cut and run"" vs invading someone\'s home. Jackson provides us with typical Jackson lines without the swearing, such as ""I am the cavalry"" a watered down version of what I would normally expect. In fact I thought there was going to be no swearing in the film until the likable John C. Reilly slips a fast one near the end...""big effing ants."" Good film to relax the brain and break out the popcorn. No need to think about non-linear time and what happens inside a black hole.Guide: No sex or nudity. 1 F-word.', ""Not really of course. Or at least not for the characters involved. And speaking of them, let's get this out of the way straight from the start: there is not much meat on the characters of the story (no pun intended) and the story is pretty simple. It's about the spectacle and about having fun.So while most might agree that the original Kong is the best one, this still is an entertaining ride and watch. The actors are doing their best with little, but the main star is CGI and the action scenes. It is light and fun and it does not pretend otherwise. Samuell L. Jackson may have had better roles, but he's always given it a 100 %.I also urge everyone who watches this to wait until the credits are done. There is a neat little surprise/scene after them ..."", 'Well I\'m a big monkey movie fan from way back, having seen the original ""King Kong"" when I was about nine years old, and even then the picture was already almost three decades old. One might argue that yet another iteration of the mighty Kong is rather unnecessary, but for all that, I was on board to see this flick to see what the latest in story line and technical achievement would bring to the table. I\'d have to say I walked away fairly impressed with the epic monster battles the picture had to offer. The technology available today certainly blows away the stop motion photography of the 1930\'s and adds a dimension of realism that couldn\'t be captured even a couple decades ago.Set in the same universe as the 2014 ""Godzilla"" movie, I was gratified to see that we didn\'t have to wait around a long time to have Kong show up for his first appearance. It\'s only a few minutes into the set up of the story when we get our first glimpse of the giant gorilla, and from there things set up for a pretty fast pace once the investigation team makes it\'s initial foray on Skull Island. I can\'t say that the action of the military crew against Kong was handled very realistically, but after all, movies about huge apes aren\'t going to be grounded in reality much anyway. The treat here is in the over the top action sequences, like Kong engaging in hand to helicopter combat, satisfying one\'s expectation for visceral thrills coming at you non-stop.With an ensemble cast, I didn\'t get much of a sense that there was one main star here required to carry the picture for the humans. Some of them, like the John Goodman character, came to an unexpectedly quick demise, as the movie gradually revealed an array of fabled prehistoric creatures in battle against the landing party and Kong himself. I don\'t know that \'skullcrawler\' was the best name they could have come up with for those ancient looking giant lizards; the most creative one was probably the walking tree trunk that came to life when one of the explorers gave it a reason to get up and take a stroll. It was clunky looking, but pretty cool at the same time.A major departure from the original ""King Kong"" and it\'s subsequent remakes was the absence of a Kong/leading lady dynamic. It was teased to some degree with Kong\'s saving Brie Larson\'s character from drowning, but the story line didn\'t take it in the same direction as prior films did. Nor did the story rely on capturing Kong to show him off as some huge sideshow attraction back in the civilized world. Those elements benefited the story in as much as there will be plenty enough time for Kong to make his mark when he takes on Godzilla on the big screen in a couple more years.So basically, just go for the gusto with this flick. It\'s positioned to provide an adrenaline rush for fans of great monster action and outstanding visual effects, enhanced by colorful cinematography in the lush and luxuriant backdrop of present day Hawaii and British Columbia simulating 1973 Vietnam. I\'ll be seeing it again, because let\'s face it, I\'m just a sucker for these big ape extravaganzas.', '""Kong: Skull Island"" shoots for the unusual goal of both addressing the Vietnam War and being a sci-fi/action flick. If you watch it expecting mainly brain candy then you won\'t be disappointed. As is usually the case with these sorts of movies, there\'s no real character development so you end up wanting more of the monsters.Since Samuel L. Jackson is one of the cast members, you might be wondering if he uses the word that we expect him to use in every movie. The answer is that he almost does but gets interrupted. They probably avoided using the whole word so that the movie wouldn\'t get restricted. Real pity, since his usage of the word makes life worth living.In the end, the movie was what I expected. Nothing special at all, but passable if you\'re in the mood for brainless fun.', 'The original 1933 Fay Wray version is great, the 1976 Jeff Bridges / Jessica Lange version is awful, and the 2005 Peter Jackson version is long, but good, this was the latest film to bring us one of the most famous movie monsters. Basically in 1973, U.S. government agent Bill Randa (John Goodman) hires former British Special Air Service Captain and skilled tracker James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston) to guide him on an expedition to the charted but unexplored place known as ""Skull Island"". Also recruited are Lieutenant Colonel Preston Packard (Samuel L. Jackson), his right Major Jack Chapman (Toby Kebbell) and Captain Earl Cole (Shea Whigham), and the Vietnam War veteran helicopter squadron, the Sky Devils, to escort them to the island, they are also joined by pacifist photojournalist Mason Weaver (Brie Larson). Arriving on Skull Island, besides Conrad\'s objections, the men drop explosives developed by seismologist Houston Brooks (Corey Hawkins), to determine if the ground is hollow. Suddenly the helicopters are attacked by a 100 foot-tall bipedal ape, most are destroyed, the survivors escape those that crash, they know their only hope is that a resupply team will meet them at the island\'s northern end in three days time. They split into two groups, Packard confronts Randa, holding him at gunpoint for an explanation, Randa reveals he is part of a secret government organisation called Monarch, and the real purpose of the expedition is to acquire proof of the existence of forgotten monsters, Randa also mentions seeing a monster attack a Navy ship himself. The dead comrades are buried by Packard and his men, they begin searching for the missing members of the expedition, including Chapman, they encounter a giant spider-like creature that attacks them. While Conrad, Weaver, Brooks, biologist San Lin (Tian Jing), soldier Reg Slivko (Thomas Mann), Landsat employee Victor Nieves (John Ortiz) and others encounter the local Iwi natives, and they meet American pilot Hank Marlow (John C. Reilly), who crashed on the island in 1944, during World War II. Marlow reveals that the giant ape, known as Kong, is worshipped as a god by the natives, he is the last of his kind, and he is the island\'s guardian, protecting the people from reptilian underground monsters, called Skullcrawlers, the creatures killed Japanese pilot Gunpei Ikari (Miyavi), who also landed on the island with Marlow. Marlow explains that Kong only attacked the helicopters to stop the bombs waking the ""Big One"", meanwhile, miles away, Chapman is alive, he witnesses Kong wrestling and defeating a giant octopus, Chapman flees to the woods, he encounters a giant stick insect, before being eaten by a Skullcrawler. Weaver is awed by the compassion of Kong after the ape saves her from an encounter with a giant sker buffalo, following this Conrad\'s group set off in a boat down, built by Marlow and the now-deceased Ikari, built from parts of their crashed planes. Following an attack by pterosaur-like creatures called Leafwings, and Nieves being killed, the survivors connect with Packard, he insists on continuing the search for Chapman, Marlow reluctantly leads the team to the Forbidden Zone, a forgotten battleground between Kong\'s ancestors and the Skullcrawlers. The same Skullcrawler that killed Chapman devours Randa and massacres many soldier, it is killed by Weaver triggering an explosion, a vengeful Packard blames Kong for the deaths of his men, he plans to trap and kill Kong, while Conrad will lead the non-military personnel back to northern end to rendezvous with the resupply team. While scouting the path ahead, Conrad and Weaver encounter Kong up-close and personal, they and Marlow resolve to save him, Packard\'s trap incapacitates Kong and he wants the men to set explosives around the ape. Before Packard can kill Kong, Conrad\'s group intervenes, Conrad and Weaver convince the other soldiers to spare Kong, but Packard is consumed with lust for revenge and refuses to back down, then suddenly ""the big one"" appears, an enormous alpha Skullcrawler, all but Packard flee when it attacks. An injured Kong recovers and crushes Packard to death, Kong is overpowered by the Skullcrawler, the survivors are chased towards the shore, Cole fails to kill the Skullcrawler in a suicidal strike, the humans are cornered, but Kong returns and successfully kills the creature, ripping its guts out through its mouth. In the end, Kong allows the surviving humans to leave, but more helicopters are approaching the island, Kong awaits their arrival, it is unclear what will happen next, also sometime later Marlow returns home to his family, his wife and now grown up son, who have not seen him since the war. In the post-credits sequence, there is a reference to the existence of other monsters, including Godzilla, Rodan, Mothra, and King Ghidorah, the roar of Godzilla hints that maybe there will be a follow-up where Kong and Godzilla will meet. Also starring Jason Mitchell as Mills, Marc Evan Jackson as Landsat Steve, Richard Jenkins as Senator Willis and Robert Taylor as Athena Captain. The cast all do their parts well, the story is nice and simple, obviously this reboot is different as Kong never goes to New York or to the top of the Empire State Building, but it doesn\'t matter, there are plenty of exciting sequences, and the brilliant special effects bring to life the gigantic gorilla and many nasty creatures in the one location, a worthwhile return to the franchise, a terrific fantasy action adventure, It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects.

At Skull Island they encounter a marvel of evolution , a colossal thing of power called Kong. The squadron and subordinates venture into the domain of the mighty Kong, as their mission of discovery becomes one of survival, they must fight to escape a primal Eden in which humanity does not belong. Along the way , the squad avoiding and battling all sorts of creatures and beasts , whilst Colonel Packard has another plan in mind.The eighth wonder of the world. This nail-biting movie contains noisy action , thrills , emotion and a lot of breathtaking battles including gigantic fights among monsters and helicopters crashing on ground . This spectacular movies is well-suited to its subject , concerning diverse team of scientists, soldiers and adventurers unite to explore a sinister island , finding King Kong and igniting the ultimate battle between man and nature. As the real starring turns out to be the monstrous ape¨Kong¨, the all-powerful eight-metre-tall silverback gorilla who faces off a handful of valiant but insignificant defenders must fight tooth and nail with formidable adversaries and the isle's mighty ruler . This ¨Kong¨retools the original's iconic components through the hyper-evolved wonder of 21st century CGI . The great ape himself is really the big star of the wonderful show , delivering the necessary goods to surprise and wonder us . Kong gives an enormous spectacle made with a level of photo-realist detail so expensive and intricate as to be unimaginable to the Stop-Motion , painted-glass by maestros Willis O'Brian and Ray Harryhausen in 1933 King Kong version directed by Ernest B Schoedsack and Merian C. Cooper or the animatronicist with Kong made by Carlo Rambaldi of the 1976 version or the former 2005 by Peter Jackson , made by means of abundant digital effects similar to this last one , Kong : Skull island . It is a stunning technical achievement , but one that threatens to overwhelm the potent tale it supposedly serves . All over two hours , the movie's gigantism extends ways beyond the scale of its effects . The script attempts hard to build on its more interesting components , mixing adventures , military feats and jungle battles as wel as songs in ¨Apocalypse Now¨ style . The screenplay is unreservedly on the side of Kong , in spite of making an excessive massacre, more than the proud and vengeful Colonel Packard/Samuel L. Jackson . And the movie's spiriited climax is worthy of its ancestry . The fim packs a colorful and brilliant cinematogaphy by Larry Fong .Being shot on several locations in Oahu, Hawaii, USA , Los Angeles, California, Chicago , Illinois ,Tân Hoá, Quang Binh, Vietnam Ha Long Bay,Quang Ninh,Vietnam ,Moreton Bay, Gold Coast, Mount Tamborine, Queensland, Australia ,Village Roadshow Studios, Oxenford, Queensland,Australia .As well as a moving and thrilling musical score by Henry Jackman.

And that was essentially all that this movie turned out to be, sad to say.So this movie is supposed to be a prequel to the older ""King Kong"" movies, and the audience is supposed to believe that the secrets of Skull Island and the secrets of the existence of the mighty Kong managed to be a secret and kept quiet by all those who managed to escape from the Island alive? Sure, why not... Plausible? No, hardly so. But let\'s roll with it, for the sake of the entertainment purposes.So the story, in all its simplicity, is about a group of scientists, funded by the American government, and assisted by the US armed forces, venture to a mysterious Island shrouded in a perpetual mist, where they are to look into what mysteries the Island hold. And they find a place where nature is merciless and evolved beyond the rest of the world.I found the story to be way too simplistic and far fetched to be a worthy addition to the ""King Kong"" legacy. Sure, this was a visually stimulating movie, but it just didn\'t make sense. None of it did! So a small group of secluded islands harbor growth of natural predators to monstrous sizes of gargantuan proportions. Makes any sense? No, hardly so. Especially since you get to see like only a single gargantuan spider, one ape (not counting the skeletal remains in the graveyard) and some oddly-shaped reptilian beings. The ecosystem just doesn\'t make sense. How would there be enough food for such creatures? Would they feast upon one another, yes? But why isn\'t there more of them then?The characters in the movie were two-dimensional and lacking anything that even remotely would be anything like character depth and growth. It was like watching clones and drones milling about. Especially characters like Hank Marlow (played by John C. Reilly). He had been there since World War II, yet managed to elude learning to speak the native language of those tribesmen on the Island, yet he lived among them? Sure, that was just believable. And also the painfully generic and stereotypical Preston Packard character (played by Samuel L. Jackson). Wow, just wow! That character was the epitome of how you make a character as generic and pointless as you possibly can.The visual effects were off the charts, though. ""Kong: Skull Island"", as I mentioned earlier, is an effects movie. And I do applaud the special effects team, because they really mustered up here and came together with something very pleasing to the eye. It all looked very real and had so many nice touches in the details.""Kong: Skull Island"" was not an overly impressive movie, not in the slightest. It is the type of movie that you watch, then check it off your watch-list, and you quickly forget about it, just as you did with Peter Jacksons take on the original ""King Kong"" movie.', ""Skull Island features the biggest Kong yet, a towering 100 ft tall primate able to swat helicopters from the sky like flies. But bigger doesn't necessarily mean better: while this latest great ape adventure is a slight improvement over Peter Jackson's bloated 2005 remake of the '33 classic, it's a monster movie desperately in need of a decent plot. The special effects laden action sequences cannot fail to impress, but the story does not.The extremely basic screenplay takes a group of scientists and soldiers, has them embark on an expedition to the titular uncharted island, where they encounter Kong, who knocks them for six. The survivors must make their way to a rendezvous point on the North side of the island, avoiding being eaten by a variety of massive creatures or getting trodden on by the oversized simian. And that's about it. Kong battles a giant octopus, a massive crab/spider attacks the humans, vicious birds swoop out the sky, and nasty lizard creatures crawl from beneath the island's surface, all of which is mindlessly entertaining, but not in the least bit inspired.5.5 out of 10, rounded up to 6 for token eye candy Brie Larson, who strips to a figure hugging vest in an attempt to distract viewers from the lack of fresh ideas."", 'The second film in the Legendary MonsterVerse, Kong: Skull Island reboots and remakes King Kong for a new generation that would see the 70\'s remake as silly, the Peter Jackson film as old and if that last statement is true, would think that the 1933 original was some kind of archaeological find like the Shroud of Turin. In 1944* and 1973, Kong has made his presence known as war continues to intrude on Skull Island. This leads Bill Randa (John Goodman), head of the U. S. government organization Monarch, to send a team to that island to find out exactly what\'s going on with the monsters that have emerged. Once there, Lieutenant Colonel Preston Packard (Samuel Jackson), former British Special Air Service Captain James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston), photographer Mason Weaver (Brie Larson) and seismologist Houston Brooks (Corey Hawkins, playing the younger version of the character from Godzilla: King of the Monsters) begin dropping seismic explosives and mapping the island before Kong attacks. The battle separates the scientists and soldiers, with Packard wanting to kill Kong and the others meeting the natives and discovering that the big beast is the last of his kind, protecting the island and its natives from the Skullcrawlers that wiped out its entire family. By the end, Kong is victorious and has proved his true good nature. Monarch recruits Conrad and Weaver, while revealing that Kong is not alone, revealing cave paintings of Godzilla, Mothra, Rodan and King Ghidorah. I\'m excited to see what happens next, as the films have placed both Kong and Godzilla on the same emotional playing field. They\'re both the last of their kind, dealing with the loss of their race to an enemy (the Skullcrawlers and the Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms) and are absolute predators. However, Godzilla has no interest in human beings while Kong serves as their protector. Who knew that a modern King Kong movie would reference seventies films like The Conversation and Apocalpyse Now, somehow becoming one of the best films in the series? Here\'s to being pleasantly surprised. * I love that John C. Reilly\'s character has been on the island since World War II. He also has on a jacket that references Kaneda\'s in Akira: ""Good for your health, bad for your education.""', 'My wife and I watched this at home on BluRay, and of course the picture and sound are flawless. Not only the direct sound and the ample surround sounds, but also great use of a deep bass subwoofer track. Saw it again October 2018 and enjoyed it as much the second time.This Kong movie deviates quite far from the 1933 ""King Kong"" which culminates in Manhattan with Kong climbing the Empire State building. In this version modern (1973) satellite images discover a previously unknown island, they called it Skull Island. A small group of explorers convince a Senator to fund a trip so that a competing country doesn\'t get there before a USA expedition.The mission includes military men and Army helicopters and their first encounter with this giant of an ape doesn\'t go very well. With all helicopters downed and many killed, those on the ground must find a way to get to a prearranged rescue spot on the north side of the island.Tom Hiddleston as James Conrad was recruited for his fighting skills. Samuel L. Jackson is the hard-nosed officer Preston Packard. Pretty Brie Larson is in the movie as eye candy, as experienced correspondent photographer Mason Weaver. She was using an authentic period Leica camera and really was taking photos during filming.As they are moving through the forest of the island they encounter John C. Reilly as Hank Marlow, a soldier who had been on the island for 28 years, since WW2, and knew nothing about the outside world but became their key to escape the island.There are many battles with giant prehistoric beasts of various sorts that have survived on the island, Kong actually is the one who keeps them in check, keeps them from overcoming the world. It was filmed in some really exotic, beautiful areas of Vietnam.An interesting and entertaining take on the Kong story.', 'Though not without a few WTF moments - and not in the way that is fun but more head-scratching, like a couple of characters dying out of nowhere - this is the most entertaining monster movie since The Host and possibly from Hollywood since... well, the Jackson King Kong (though it also has some debt to Jurassic Park and, to a degree a friend reminded me after seeing the film, Aliens). Aside from what is in the movie in and of itself, which is plenty as an ironic and satirical blockbuster (at least up to a point, in small but enough doses), as a world-building enterprise it\'s spectacular, and is a step up from the previous entry in this new WB/Legendary ""Moster-Kaiiju-Verse"", Godzilla.I think the difference between the two is simple but profound: Edwards was fascinated more with spectacle and the presence of Godzilla, but he wasn\'t so set on building human characters to connect with (except for Bryan Cranston, who was shamefully wasted after a promising start). Director Jordan Vogt-Roberts is all about characters, and even gives some time to people who should be nothing secondary ones (I know the complaints already coming, that there are too many, and that may be true - on a first viewing I was fine with it for the simple fact that the dialog given to these military runts and other scientist-types were either funny or clever enough. Everyone has charisma and characters who need to have chemistry (Hiddleston-Larson, or Larson and Kong) give it enough juice in that area.But more than that is that Kong himself is done right by the writers and filmmakers. Unlike in Godzilla as well, here we have a character who actually IS a character, someone who functions in the story, shows deeper wells of emotion (yes, a carry-over from the best of the 1933 and 2005 Kong movies is that Kong is vulnerable), and finds through non-verbal communication how to connect - or decidedly not, quite the opposite - with these Vietnam war hosts. He has goals and real motivations; while they are steeped in monster movie lore, it\'s sharp and exciting monster movie lore, and things are explained by John C. Reilly here and there (he\'s the 28-years-gone survivor of being left during WW2, a more innocent-yet-still-bloody time in US history, also with us vs some Asian menace), yet a lot is left to the imagination.How do these prehistoric-ish ""Skull Crawlers"" come out from these blasts put out by these helicopters? Who knows? Who cares? The point is these giant lizard things are genuinely terrifying; there\'s some limited creativity in their designs, but what\'s exciting is that the direction is all about drawing out suspense. And the island itself has many surprises (there\'s one point where a creature is revealed as something you would thing you could sit on!) and also with the natives who are... just scenery, mostly, but at least the movie doesn\'t try to go too far into cultural insensitivity or anything. They\'re simply there and do what they can for the Reilly character over these many years; Reilly, by the way, scruffy and laughing often and happy even as he is totally terrified (""I\'ve only been here 28 years,"" he says at one point up against military/US egotism personified by Samuel L Jackson) is what Bryan Cranston was to Godzilla, only here there is much more and he\'s possibly the best human presence in the movie.How about the satire, if it is there? I think there\'s more that could be dissected with it being Vietnam, or more specifically in 1973 as Nixon is preparing for pulling out troops (of course that wouldn\'t be for a full two years later, but you get the idea). Jackson\'s Col Packard is trying to hide his anguish at having to ""abandon"" this war (he can\'t bare to say defeat) so this other South-East conflict will do; it\'s Us vs Them and Us as usual not recognizing all of our might is insignificant when on their turf. It\'s not the sharpest commentary ever, but it\'s not without accident it\'s there either. The iconography is compelling as well: all of those helicopters, blasting away Black Sabbath\'s ""Paranoid"" as these charges drop on the island - asking for it, in monster movie fashion (messing with nature, you fools!), but this time there\'s the added element of how soldiers and civilians act, and recognizing who is ""King"" in the end.This is a spectacular good time at the movies, in case I didn\'t make that clear. All of the actors are doing excellent work, the kind that you would never get to see back when monster movies were in the realm of square B-movie territory. If anything this would be a splendid double feature with Jurassic Park (aside from the eye-roll at Jackson repeating a ""butts"" line straight-faced, as if the movie would be in trouble unless he did it), as both involve charismatic, memorable actors and relatively decent supporting characters facing off against monsters that are from another time and place, with snappy dialog, and visual effects that are out of this world. And the climax - my Kong! Spinkle some 70\'s Vietnam-Rock icing and you got yourself a blockbuster cake of exceptional proportions.', ""Having previously seen all three versions of King Kong-1933, 1976, and 2005-and knowing of some of the good notices of this particular version, I was very stoked to watch this! My movie theatre-working friend had not yet watched it either so this turned out to be the first time for both of us. In summary: This was quite a different take on Kong and his living quarters on Skull Island with many human characters that we get very much involved in caring about and thrilling in how they resolve to take care of things. And, yes, the fights Kong gets involved in are very exciting to watch. I should note that we watched this in regular screen, not IMAX or 3-D though if we had, it might have been even more thrilling! I really don't want to reveal anymore so I'll just say that me and my friend definitely recommend Kong: Skull Island."", 'I usually don\'t comment on massively budgeted blockbusters, but ""Kong: Skull Island"" is such a joyfully tongue-in-cheek homage to giant monster B-movie cinema that I simply had to make an exception! This is a tremendously over-the-top and silly creature-feature, but the undemanding popcorn-entertainment value is just irresistible. The original King Kong, from 1933 already, is a monumental piece of cinema and still very powerful today. The more recent (2005) and expensive Peter Jackson remake was, at least in my humble opinion, a very boring and overlong romantic drama. ""Kong: Skull Island"" nicely falls right between these two extremes. By no means, it\'s great cinema, but at least it provides thrills, chuckles and adrenaline rushes from start to finish. The intro and scene-setting are already incredibly dumb, but oh so fun! We\'re supposed to believe that there exists a secret government agency (yes, another one) named Monarch, and their area of expertise is searching around the world for monsters and oversize animals. In 1973, The agency\'s CEO (an energetic John Goodman) benefices from the US-army\'s retreat out of Vietnam to recover soldiers and assets for a mission to the secretive Skull Island; a place where - and I quote - God left his creation unfinished.""Kong: Skull Island"" certainly doesn\'t waste any time! The helicopters have barely begun circling over the island, and there already emerges the humongous ape King Kong to slap them out of the sky like tiny ping-pong balls! The few remaining soldiers, led by the frustrated platoon leader Samuel L. Jackson, continue on foot and swear to destroy King Kong, but they soon learn that the island homes lots of other giant and unspeakably evil monstrous creations, and that Kong isn\'t even such a bad fella. It\'s a mission impossible to take this film seriously, but with the right mindset (and perhaps a few six-packs of beer) you\'ll have a great time. Seeing the story takes place in 1973 and has an abundantly clear Vietnam collection, it also somewhat feels like a long-feature ""Tour of Duty"" movie with a downright awesome 70s soundtrack. The special effects are cheesy and exaggerated, the dialogues are deliciously tacky (""hm, a mushroom...that means there must a river nearby!"") and the casting is perfect. I already mentioned John Goodman and Samuel L. Jackson, but there\'s also John C. Reilly as the bewildered WWII veteran who\'s been stuck on the island since 1942.', 'This film tells the story of a team of scientists and army personnel, who head off to a remote and uncharted Pacific island for a cartographical expedition. Little do they know, that monstrous lifeforms are waiting for them on the unexplored island.I didn\'t think I would enjoy ""Kong: Skull Island"" so much! The story is very engaging because of the constant unknowns. The characters are divided into good and bad, while monsters are also likewise divided. This quadratic division gives characters a clear personality, and what the character represent. The visual effects are really good, as there is just no way that you can tell that the island and it\'s unusual creatures are computer generated. The credit scene touches me to tears. The post credit scene is comparatively long, and is worth staying for. I think this is a great blockbuster.', ""The King Kong franchise has survived for over eighty years; director Jordan Vogt-Roberts version places the legendary creature in the early 1970's as America is abandoning the Viet Nam War, but national security is never over. Modern satellite images discover an uncharted island in the Pacific that is believed to be just as mysterious as the Bermuda Triangle.A team of scientists are joined by some highly-trained military escorts. The government reluctantly finances this expedition that just happens to be home territory of the mighty Kong and other giant monsters that lumber out of every corner. After the humans are discovered it is high octane destruction and carnage.Don't think about reasoning the story line. This is a fun thing with amazing visuals. Character development...practically none. Dialogue...disjointed most of the time. Big dollar action flick with some pure skin-crawling tension. A who's who cast that includes: Samuel L. Jackson, John Goodman, Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larson, John C. Reilly, Toby Kebbell, Tian Jing, Shea Whigham and Terry Notary."", 'In the year 1944, somewhere over the South Pacific, Lieutenant Hank Marlow (Will Brittain) lands with his parachute on an island after his plane crashes. Another soldier, Gunpei Ikari (Miyavi), lands. Marlow draws his gun on Ikari and shoots but misses. Ikari takes out his gun and chases after Marlow. They run into the forest and fight when they go by a cliff. Ikari nearly impales Marlow with his sword, but Marlow pulls it away. Ikari then has Marlow on the ground and nearly kills him before a gigantic ape hand appears. The two men then see the ape (Terry Notary) rise above them.In 1973, in Washington D.C., government official Bill Randa (John Goodman) and geologist Houston Brooks (Corey Hawkins) arrive to meet with Senator Willis (Richard Jenkins) to receive funding for an expedition to a recently discovered location called Skull Island. Willis isn\'t too keen on the idea, but Randa goads him into relenting. Before leaving, Randa tells Willis he also would like a military escort.The Sky Devils squadron are gathered on their last day before they can finally go home. Led by Colonel Preston Packard (Samuel L. Jackson), they include Captain Earl Cole (Shea Whigham), Slivko (Thomas Mann), Reles (Eugene Cordero), Glenn Mills (Jason Mitchell), and Jack Chapman (Toby Kebell), who is Packard\'s right hand man. Packard receives the call for the expedition and gladly accepts the job.Randa and Brooks go to a bar and find a former British Special Air Service captain named James Conrad (Tom Hiddleston) to be their tracker. Conrad is confronted by two bar patrons who believe he cheated in a game of pool, but he easily subdues the men. Randa is immediately impressed, telling Brooks they\'ve found their guide. Conrad sits with Randa and Brooks to hear their plan. When he hears their offer, he demands more money and points out that there\'s a good chance that the trip will get them killed for reasons involving severe weather conditions or predatory creatures.Inside a darkroom, anti-war photographer Mason Weaver (Brie Larson) is developing some photos she took of the conflict in Vietnam. She gets a call to join the expedition and she arrives at the base to meet with Packard and his men, plus a team of scientists from the company Landsat, including Brooks\' fellow geologist San Lin (Jing Tian) and Landsat employees Victor Nieves (John Ortiz) and Steve (Marc Evan Jackson). Weaver has reservations about the mission and thinks the military is planning something bad. Brooks goes over the mission and what they hope to find on Skull Island.The team sails into the ocean before taking choppers to the island. They must pass through clouds that produce hurricane-like conditions but are able to find a high-pressure pocket that they believe will be a safer route. After a turbulent ride through the storm, the choppers fly across the area. Weaver takes some pictures while the soldiers begin dropping seismic charges into the ground, setting off explosions. Almost immediately, a tree is thrown through one of the choppers, sending it crashing to the ground. The team then sees Kong towering over them. He sends another tree through a chopper before grabbing a few more and smashing them into the ground. The surviving team members are separated once they hit the ground. Amidst the flames burning from the remains of the choppers, Packard stares up at Kong, who looks down back at him.Packard confronts Randa at gunpoint and demands to know what really brought them there. Randa admits that he had known about the existence of monsters like Kong for a while, and he is seeking proof for his organization, Monarch.Conrad, Weaver, Brooks, Lin, Slivko, and Nieves are grouped together while Randa, Packard, Mills, Cole, and other soldiers set out to look for Chapman, as he is equipped with enough ammunition that Packard intends to use against Kong. As the soldiers walk through a bamboo forest forest, one soldier suddenly stops, a bamboo tree has impaled him through the mouth. Above them is a giant spider that starts attacking them. Mills is pulled up by the webbing, and the rest of the soldiers start cutting its legs off. Mills cuts himself loose, and Packard shoots the spider to death.Chapman is by himself near a river. He sees Kong walking through the river to tend to a wound he sustained from the choppers\' gunfire. Kong drinks from the river and then finds a giant octopus. He tangles with it, fighting off its tentacles before he starts to eat it. He then drags the octopus carcass away.Conrad\'s group is cornered by a tribe of natives. As they try to defend themselves, out comes an older Marlow (now played by John C. Reilly). He assures both groups that they are not harmful to each other and then invites the group past the wall. Marlow explains to the group that he\'s been there for the last 28 years and has learned a lot about the natives and the island itself. Kong is like a god to them, as he has been protecting them from the creatures that dwell beneath the earth and have been killing off the natives for centuries, as well as Kong\'s own family. Marlow calls them ""Skull Crawlers"". They stayed underground until the explosions from the seismic charges woke them up. If anything happens to Kong, the Skull Crawlers will dominate the island. He also suggests that the Skull Crawlers that have come to the surface are just juveniles and that a much larger one exists.Still alone, Chapman walks through the forest and sits on a log. The log turns out to be a giant insect. Chapman shoots at it, but the creature does not retaliate. As the creature leaves, Chapman is killed by a Skull Crawler.Conrad tells Marlow that they plan to make it to their rendezvous point on the north side of the island within three days so that they may be rescued. Marlow says that it cannot be done in three days on foot, so he agrees to guide them the right way. He bids the natives farewell and takes the crew on a boat. Shortly after riding away, Nieves is snatched up by carnivorous birds and is torn apart midair.Along the way, Weaver sees a huge water buffalo stuck under a crashed chopper. She tries lifting it up to free the buffalo, only for Kong to show up and pull the chopper off. He stares down at Weaver briefly and leaves. She appears more awed by him than terrified.Marlow leads the group into The Forbidden Zone, which is a former battleground between Kong\'s ancestors and the Skull Crawlers. The enormous remains of Kong\'s family lie among the field. A Skull Crawler appears, forcing the group to hide. The Skull Crawler then spits out Chapman\'s skull and dog tags, which Conrad notices. Packard and his men come around the same area. Randa is taking pictures and is then snatched up and eaten by a Skull Crawler. Another beast shows up and starts to attack and pull victims in with its tongue. The groups continue their battle with the Skull Crawlers plus a wave of the carnivorous birds. Marlow takes out the sword that belonged to Ikari and slashes through several of the birds before handing it over to Conrad. Weaver kills one by tossing a lighter into a hole that produces fumes, which is ignited and sets the creature on fire.After the fight, they regroup. Packard is still set on looking for Chapman. Conrad shows Packard Chapman\'s dog tags to confirm his demise. Still, Packard wants to look for Chapman\'s ammunition stash so that they can kill Kong; he is hellbent on revenge for the deaths of his men, despite the objections of Marlow, Conrad, and Weaver.That night, Packard gathers explosives and lays a trap for Kong. Meanwhile, Conrad and Weaver encounter the beast, but Weaver approaches him cautiously. She places her hand on his face and he is gentle. However, Packard lures Kong toward him and ignites the fuel along the water, singeing and burning Kong\'s fur. Kong stomps on Steve and kills another man in the chaos before collapsing. Packard then gets ready to set off some explosives, but Conrad and Weaver try to stop him. They convince the other soldiers that they need Kong to keep the Skull Crawlers out. The soldiers turn on Packard, who remains defiant. Just then, the biggest Skull Crawler bursts out of the ground, forcing the group to run. Packard stays behind to detonate the explosives, but Kong crushes him under his fist.The survivors then head toward the shore as the main Skull Crawler pursues them. Cole stays behind to sacrifice himself with the explosive devices he has strapped to himself. However, the monster tail-whips Cole into a wall and he blows up anyway. The Skull Crawler heads toward the group until Kong returns and smashes into the beast. Kong uses a ship\'s propeller attached to a length of anchor chain to would the beast, finally slashing it on the throat. The best isn\'t dead and attacks again. Weaver takes a flare gun and hits the Skull Crawler in the face with it. Kong grabs the Skull Crawler and hurls him into the wall, accidentally knocking Weaver into the river. Kong pulls Weaver out and still fights the Skull Crawler. He rams his fist down the monster\'s throat and pulls out its guts. Kong then places Weaver down next to Conrad before leaving.Shortly after, the survivors (Conrad, Weaver, Marlow, Brooks, Lin, Mills, Slivko, and Reles) depart on the boat, and three choppers show up to get them. In the distance, Kong keeps a lookout to continue protecting his territory. He pounds his fist and lets out a roar.As the credits begin, we see video footage of Marlow finally returning home to Chicago where he sees his wife again and finally meets his adult son. He then sits down to watch a Cubs game with a hot dog and a beer.After the credits, Conrad and Weaver are being held in an interrogation room by Monarch. Entering the room are Brooks and Lin, who tell the two that Kong was never the only monster out there and that this world did not always belong to humankind. Brooks pulls out some files, including a map of Tokyo, before putting on a slideshow. The slides show another crew coming across cave drawings of other monsters - Mothra, King Ghidorah, Rodan and Godzilla himself. The last thing we hear are the combined roars of Kong and Godzilla.']"
25,MonsterVerse,Godzilla: King of the Monsters,3741700,"[""Dressed up with an awesome budget and 3-D which version I saw, Godzilla King Of Monsters is a throwback to those old Japanese monster fests when Godzilla and all his pals were laying waste to most of urban Japan. Godzilla originally a villain monster became a leader to other of these titanic creatures as they battled Ghidrah the hydra head bad guy from outer space.Ghidrah's back too and he and Godzilla slug it out in of all places Boston with Fenway Park as ground zero.There's a human cast too, but like in the Japanese films they take second place to the computer graphic generated big guys.It's big and it's awesome, but doesn't have the same sense of fun as the Japanese created creatures destroying those cardboard sets."", ""GODZILLA: KING OF THE MONSTERS is a film much like its 2014 predecessor: average and interesting, but too flawed to have much in the way of rewatchability. I come to it as a huge fan of the Japanese kaiju genre; those rubber-suited bouts of the 1960s mark the high point of the genre to me, so this overlong epic is something I have a mixed reaction to. As before, the human storylines drag down the pacing and make this going on too much, and the staged conflict is boring at times.I like Millie Bobby Brown in STRANGER THINGS but she feels out of place here, tacked-on to appeal to that demographic. Kyle Chandler is also the most uninspiring protagonist I can imagine, although better actors like Ken Watanabe and Charles Dance are assured in smaller roles. There's copious monster action here as you'd expect, and I was delighted that not only does King Ghidorah show up but Mothra and Rodan too, with the right nods made to the original mythologies. But the CGI isn't quite as good as I was hoping for and the action becomes mildly repetitive before long."", ""It's five years after Godzilla's reappearance. Scientists couple Mark (Kyle Chandler) and Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) lost their son in the destruction of San Francisco. Emma is now working for Monarch in China to birth a Titan called Mothra and communicate with it using ORCA. When the base is attacked, Emma and her daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) are taken prisoners. Mark rejoins Monarch to rescue his family. The organization is threatened with folding under the US military. Instead of the possibly impossible task of annihilating the Titans, Dr. Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) could only suggest living under their domination.The premise is that the Earth is hollow. A Titan comes from space or not. Monarch has a giant super plane that can fly around the world forever. There are way too many people willing to Thanos the Earth. It goes on and on. It's a crazy mess of questionable ideas. The narrative doesn't really work. This should follow Farmiga and Millie Bobby Brown. At least, they're interesting. The action is all encompassing without the tension of stakes. It's a lot rainy CGI. I do appreciate the intent of the monster-sized action but the human-sized drama is poor."", ""With all the films and the mastery of special effects, we take for granted that movie monsters are going to be quite remarkable. I enjoyed watching them, especially Ghidrah. But then we have this lame plot with a nutcase deciding it would be good for the earth if most of the people were eliminated and we started over. The female/mother character has bought into this and is about to send the world to oblivion. The acting is so bad and the actions of the characters ridiculous. Standing around while nuclear radiation is a few feet away. Or a monster is right in front of them. Leaving a submarine and standing on the tower while Godzilla appears, instead of staying submerged. And the search fo the daughter at Fenway Park. I have to give credit. It was certainly loud but like watching a Star Trek episode, I challenge anyone to really understand the science. I wish it had been a better, more gripping story. Finally, like so many movies of its type, the loss of life is beyond belief and people don't seem all that concerned about their brothers and sisters."", ""The sequel to 2014's Godzilla has gone for monster mayhem. Unfortunately despite the destruction, it looks like cheap CGI and a brain dead dull story.It starts off as a kind of revenge movie. Kyle Chandler is a scientists called Mark Russell who is still mourning the loss of his son after Godzilla's rampage in San Francisco in the previous film. Mark views Godzilla as the enemy.His estranged wife Dr Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga) is a member of Monarch. The group that looks for monsters such as Godzilla to study.As Dr Russell is studying a creature called Mothra, They are attacked by eco-terrorists led by Alan Jonah (Charles Dance.) He takes Dr Russell and her daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) as well as a machine called Orca which can control the behaviour of the monsters.It transpires that Dr Russell is in league with Jonah. Mark Russell rejoins Monarch to rescue his daughter. However as various monsters are unleashed, he realises that only Godzilla can save the day.The story is bland, the characters are flat. Everytime the movie focuses on the human it is a snoozefest. When there are monster fights, the film literally brightens up as but you also notice that some of the CGI is poor."", ""This is a sequel to the Bryan Cranston Godzilla film which was not one of my favorites. This one went downhill as the basic plot consisted of Emma (Vera Farmiga) going Ben Tre all over the world. Her daughter (Millie Bobby Brown) takes a stab at saving Red Sox nation. Couldn't they get a cute kid to play her part?There was a lot of multi-million dollar destruction scenes that I can't see paying for themselves. The story was so bad, I was surprised to see that the lips match the sound. If you are going to watch just one blockbuster this summer, make sure this is not it."", 'The CGI is quite something and those who were complaining that you couldn\'t really see much of Godzilla in the outing before this one (American/Hollywood that is, because there have been quite a few in between in Japan), have nothing to complain in this one.One of the things that still remains ... object to quite some improvement are the human characters. Now we may not have cared too much about the classic Godzilla (Gojira) humans when it came to how they behaved or what their character was ... but we get spoiled I reckon. So when we see a story that is quite far stretched we might be nit-picking. Still this has less of the ""fake"" drama than the previous one, even though the stakes are quite higher ... now bring on King Kong into the mix (who only gets mentioned by name, but does not appear in this one) ...', 'A thought occurred to me as I was preparing for this review while re-reading some of my comments of assorted Toho monster flicks. The ones from the Fifties were made for a primarily pre-teen audience, while today, the films seem to be for adults who never really grew up. Not a put down, as I consider myself in that category and never get tired of an old fashioned monster rumble. This one had a bit of similarity to the 1956 flick, ""Godzilla vs. Monster Zero"", in which aliens from the mysterious Planet X ask the people of Earth to help them save their world from the dreaded King Ghidorah by letting them ""borrow"" Godzilla and Rodan. Those three behemoths make a reprise in this story, along with the iconic Mothra, who looked a little flimsy to me to be up against the big guys, but what the heck, you take what you can get. And such as it is, there\'s even an element of \'people are the cause of all Earth\'s problems, so maybe the solution is for the \'Titans\' to reemerge and restore some balance to the planet. Good idea there, Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga), but she\'s actually set straight by the guy who kidnapped her, Jonah Allen (Charles Dance), who wisely reminds her - ""Man cannot control the laws of nature, and neither can you"". Finally, some sanity in a monster flick.Well, the CGI was outstanding as always, but after a while you begin to see there\'s no rhyme or reason to anything that\'s going on and things start to get silly. Like at one point, isn\'t Dr. Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler) making a getaway from the rest of his Monarch cohorts to search for his wife and daughter, and then he\'s right back where he started from? What? And then at the finale, what are the odds that in the entire demolished city of Boston, Russell would find his teenage daughter (Millie Bobby Brown) hanging on for dear life amidst the rubble and destruction? Well, I guess about the same odds as Dwayne \'The Rock\' Johnson had locating his crew following the knock down-drag out in ""Rampage"".But I did get a kick out of the homage paid to the film that started it all, 1954\'s ""Godzilla"", or for you Toho fans, ""Gojira"". You know, if you affect a guttural voice and apply a Japanese accent, you can make the two words sound just about the same. Go ahead, try it. Anyway, it was when Dr. Serizawa sacrificed himself to place the \'Oxygen Destroyer\' contraption in the depths of the ocean, which was the way they solved the Godzilla problem way back when. I think it had the reverse affect here, but by that time, my attention span was getting severely compromised, as Dr. Russell\'s quest to find his family was given it\'s comeuppance by the person who remarked - ""If I had you two for parents, I\'d run away too"".', 'With Godzilla and a collection of other behemoths in this movie, you should know what sorts of things to expect. ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters"" fulfills that promise. What caught my eye was the cast. Playing the main family we have Kyle Chandler (whom you may remember from Peter Jackson\'s ""King Kong"" but who more recently appeared in Todd Haynes\'s ""Carol""), Vera Farmiga (now known for her role in the Conjuring franchise), Millie Bobby Brown (Eleven on ""Stranger Things""), Sally Hawkins (reprising her role from 2014\'s ""Godzilla"" but most recognizable as the mute protagonist of ""The Shape of Water""), David Strathairn (frequent star of John Sayles\'s movies and ""Good Night and Good Luck"") and Charles Dance (Tywin on ""Game of Thrones""). There\'s also ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" star Zhang Ziyi.Yeah, I have too much time on my hands. Basically, if you accept this movie for what it is, then it\'s some of the most fun that you\'ll ever have.', ""Director/co-writer Michael Dougherty totally hits it out of the ballpark with this simply spectacular edition to the long running Godzilla series: Not only does Dougherty keep the engrossing and exciting story hurtling along at a breathless brisk pace despite the lengthy two hour-plus running time, but he also stages the thrilling and fantastic monster fights with rip-roaring gusto, maintains a refreshingly serious tone throughout, and keeps the human drama stuff on an even keel from start to finish. Moreover, Godzilla, Mothra, Rodan, and especially King Ghidorah all look amazingly lifelike and certainly deliver the rousing mondo destructo and go-for-the-throat thingo-to-thingo goods something fierce. The cast is quite solid as well: Kyle Chandler makes for an engaging human hero, Vera Farmiga likewise does well as a conflicted scientist who has given up on the human race, and Millie Bobbi Brown elicits sympathy as the daughter caught between these two, plus there are sturdy contributions from Ken Watanabe, Ziyi Zhang, Bradley Whitford (pretty amusing as the token wisecracking comic relief guy), Sally Hawkins, Charles Dance (spot-on ruthless as the eco-terrorist human villain), Thomas Middleditch, Aisha Hinds, and O'Shea Jackson Jr. Popping up in nifty bits are David Strathairn, Joe Morton, and CCH Pounder. Bear McCreary's spirited score hits the stirring spot. The special effects are truly incredible and Lawrence Sher's striking widescreen cinematography provides a wondrous wealth of breathtaking visuals. But this is really the Big G and company's show. And boy do they ever come through like the champion monsters that they all are."", 'The first movie in 2014 was a reasonably entertaining remake, and return for the franchise, ignoring the 1998 Roland Emmerich attempt of course, it was also the first in the MonsterVerse series, followed by Kong: Skull Island, I was expecting pretty much the same thing all over again, directed by Michael Dougherty (Krampus). Basically paleobiologist Dr. Emma Russell (Orphan\'s Vera Farmiga) works for crypto-zoological organization Monarch to track down and study Titans, giant god-like monsters that once dominated the Earth. She and her daughter Madison (Stranger Things\' Millie Bobby Brown) witness the birth of a giant larva dubbed Mothra, it is calmed down with a device called the ""Orca"", which is capable of emitting frequencies that only Titans can hear. Then an organization of eco-terrorists, led by Alan Jonah (Charles Dance), attack and kidnap Emma and Madison, while Mothra escapes and cocoons herself underneath a waterfall. Monarch scientists and soldiers led by Dr. Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) and Dr. Vivienne Graham (Sally Hawkins) approach Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler), Emma\'s ex-husband, to track down Emma and Madison. They follow Godzilla to Antarctica and realise Jonah intends to free a Titan encased in ice known as ""Monster Zero"", the Monarch soldiers are ambushed, and Mark is unable to rescue his wife and daughter. Emma frees and awakens Monster Zero, it begins rampaging until Godzilla emerges and the two engage in a fight, which ends with Monster Zero killing Graham and flying away. Emma later contacts Monarch and reveals her involvement with Jonah all along, she is fuelled by the death of her son, Andrew, during the 2014 attack on San Francisco. Before the evacuation in Mexico is complete, Jonah orders Emma to wake up Rodan, this Titan is lured to fight with Monster Zero, but is defeated. Godzilla emerges from the ocean and engages Monster Zero, tearing off one of its heads, the military launches a ""Oxygen Destroyer"" missile during the fight. Godzilla is seemingly killed and sinks into the ocean, Monster Zero survives and regenerates a new head, and Rodan becomes submissive to its rule as Monster Zero awakens all the dormant Titans. Dr. Ilene Chen (Ziyi Zhang) has discovered through mythical texts that Monster Zero is Ghidorah, an ancient alien who serves as Godzilla\'s primary rival for apex predator. Mothra emerges from her cocoon and flies to Bermuda where it is able to communicate with Godzilla, who had survived the detonation and is recuperating underwater. Monarch uses the communication frequency to locate the pair, Mark and a Monarch team board a submarine to help revive Godzilla, as the natural process would take years. They decide to detonate a nuclear weapon, so Godzilla can feed on the radiation, but due to earlier damages the submarine, the weapon system is offline, so Serizawa volunteers to sacrifices himself to manually detonate the weapon, which revives Godzilla. In Boston, Emma realises that Ghidorah and the other Titans will bring far worse destruction than what humans could inflict, but Jonah ignores her pleas. Madison steals the Orca and takes it to Fenway Park, she broadcasts a frequency that attracts all the Titans to its location. Ghidorah arrives and attempts to destroy the Orca, but Monarch have assisted Godzilla to engage it. Mark leads a team to rescue Madison and escape the city before Godzilla overloads and emits a thermonuclear explosion. Mothra and Rodan arrive and fight each other while Godzilla battles Ghidorah, Mothra defeats Rodan but is disintegrated by Ghidorah. Her essence descends onto Godzilla. Mark, Emma, and Madison are reunited and try to restart the damaged Orca in order to lure Ghidorah away from the injured Godzilla. While evacuating, Emma drives away with the Orca, sacrificing herself to lure Ghidorah so Mark and Madison can escape. Godzilla recovers and burns away Ghidorah with thermonuclear pulses, with the monster defeated the other Titans bow to Godzilla as the king of the monsters. It is revealed that Titans are converging to Skull Island, where Kong is located, there are ancient paintings of Godzilla and Kong battling, meanwhile Jonah has got his hands on the decapitated head of Ghidorah. Also starring Get Out\'s Bradley Whitford as Dr. Rick Stanton, Thomas Middleditch as Sam Coleman, True Blood\'s Aisha Hinds as Colonel Diane Foster, Straight Outta Compton\'s O\'Shea Jackson Jr. (Ice Cube\'s son) as Chief Warrant Officer Barnes, David Strathairn as Admiral William Stenz, Anthony Ramos as Staff Sergeant Martinez, Elizabeth Ludlow as First Lieutenant Griffin, Jonathan Howard as Asher Jonah, Orphan\'s CCH Pounder as Senator Williams and Terminator 2\'s Joe Morton as Dr. Houston Brooks. The cast well-known stars are all fine, Chandler as a simple hero, Farmiga as the scientist wrongly thinking she\'s doing good for the planet, Dance as the mad English villain, Watanabe as the admirer of the monsters, and Whitford gets some one-liners, but it\'s not the human characters that draw your attention. The stars of the picture are indeed the monsters, Godzilla this time is relied by the humans as the one who can beat the three-headed King Ghidorah before it can destroy the world, again it returns to classic routes, monsters battling and cities being crushed, and the special effects are terrific, but it gets predictable and boring after a while, but this is only a warm-up to what audiences really want to see, King Kong versus Godzilla is next (!), as for this, this is a slightly below-average but alright science-fiction monster movie. It was nominated the Razzie for Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-Off or Sequel.

And the last one ""Godzilla vs Kong"" 2020 with Alexander Skarsgard, Rebecca Hall, Kyle Chandler , Damon Bichir , Elza González, Millie Bobby Brown .', 'Well, this 2019 adaptation of ""Godzilla"" was just another reason why Hollywood really should stay away from cashing in on Asian success.While ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters"" most definitely was a spectacular movie to look at, it was utterly and fully devoid of anything even remotely resembling a proper storyline. In fact, the movie was so predictable that even a dead man would see things coming before they happened.Visually, then this movie was quite impressive. The CGI was just phenomenal and really brought the various monsters to life on the screen. Just a shame that most of the scenes were constructed with sort of a haze going on to distort and cover up some of the scenes. That I didn\'t really understand.The monsters in the movie were quite wonderfully brought to life by CGI, and they were astounding to look at in terms of realism and levels of details. So if you enjoy a good old fashioned monster mayhem, then you\'ll definitely like what the CGI team managed to do here.A real shame that the movie was horribly brought to its knees by the lack of writing talent from Michael Dougherty Zach Shields and Max Borenstein. How can three people collectively manage to spew out such rubbish and pass it for a proper storyline and plot? It was so simply that even a small child could manage to write this stuff.They did have some good acting talents on the cast list, just a shame that they were given such a lousy script to work with. The cast list includes the likes of Kyle Chandler, Ken Watanabe, Ziyi Zhang, Bradley Whitford and Charles Dance. Not even bothering with mentioning Millie Bobby Brown, because she is overrated.It seems that director Michael Dougherty had bitten off more than he could chew with this 2019 ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters"" project. And while the movie was visually astounding, the rest was just mediocre. I am rating ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters"" six out of ten stars, solely because of the visual effect, the fact that this is a Godzilla movie after all, and also because of some of the abovementioned actors and actresses.', 'Godzilla: King of the Monsters is gorgeous, with fully-realized and realistic versions of the monsters I grew up loving so much. However, the truth is, I was always more than happy with their look even when they were played by men in suits.Also, whenever I hear studios say things like how this movie ""brings together Godzilla and King Kong in an ecosystem of other giant super-species, both classic and new"" I throw up a little in my mouth.Imagine my surprise when I didn\'t hate this. And for once, my wife, who consistently looks at kaiju movies and says, ""I don\'t get it"" was into one of them. I blame her young age and not growing up on a steady diet of Gamera, Rodan and Ultraman.This movie also reimagines Godzilla and the other kaiju as almost Lovecraftian elder gods that owned the Earth before we did. I\'m fine with that as well. And I\'ll sit through human drama as long as I get the payoff of sweet, sweet lizard on dragon violence and thankfully, this film delivers.Michael Dougherty, who wrote Superman Returns - a movie I despise on a level that I will legitimately fistfight people over - and Trick \'r Treat directed this movie.I really don\'t need a pushed shared universe to enjoy a movie. As it is, Godzilla fans kind of built their own continuity in the Toho films. But that\'s what people want in a post-Marvel Cinematic Universe and here, they get it, leading into the next film\'s battle with Kong.That said, the scene where all the various kaiju bow to Godzilla? Yeah, that was awesome.', 'My wife and I watched this at home on BluRay from our public library.To me when you watch a movie like this, any ""Godzilla"" movie, you don\'t intend to take it too seriously. It is all fantasy, the best that I can hope is to be entertained.I was entertained! But not as much as the one 5 years ago.Still, part of the entertainment for me is the soundtrack and having a good powered subwoofer at home, it really feels at times like you are in the action.The movie itself? It plays off the last Godzilla movie where nuclear energy keeps Godzilla strong. Several other giants are involved, including Mothra, who ends up working with Godzilla to protect humankind.In this kind of fantasy action movie the human characters hardly matter. The actors are all capable but that is all they need to be, Godzilla, Mothra, and the other giants are the real stars. Want action? This one has lots of action.', 'This film tells the story of Godzilla and many other monsters roaming free on Earth.The story is just bad. It does not make sense, defies science and is simply unconvincing. Using a nuclear bomb to revive Godzilla does not make sense. People surviving nuclear explosions does not make sense. Dialogs are funny unintentionally. And the scene of monster zero radiating rays of fire made me laugh! I could not wait for it to end.', 'A fresh chapter to the King of the Monsters, Godzilla saga. This time out the unstoppable monster is taking on three powerful adversaries colliding with Rodan, Mathra and the ultimate triple threat from three-headed King Ghidorah. It should prove to be a battle royal powerful enough to destroy the world. Giant size entertainment for all ages; CGI is not the best and stupid situations keep my rating down.Starring are Kyle Chandler, Vera Farmiga, David Strathairn, Ken Watanabe and Thomas Middleditch.', 'Where to even start... as a monster movie it ticks all the boxes, destruction and fighting laced with over the top CGI. The storyline sort of made sense, but left a lot to be desired. The instant travel to anywhere in the world was where I lost the plot. Decent acting but weak conceptually.', 'If you\'re watching Godzilla then I figure it\'s for one of two reasons:1.) You watched Godzilla as a kid and you want to see his evolution. 2.) You want to see maximum destructionI\'m more in the first category than the second. I loved Godzilla as a kid back when his battles seemed more tame and less destructive.Just like 2014 Godzilla, again he has a major foe. This time his nemesis is called Monster Zero. Being that San Francisco and Las Vegas are already in ruins it\'s time to destroy other U.S. cities.This plot was moved along by a misanthropic scientist. Like so many movies there\'s always the human hating individual that sees the planet\'s survival as being dependent upon mankind\'s destruction. You know: overcrowding, pollution, war, etc. as if human beings have never done anything good.For the Godzilla fans that want to see more \'Zilla and less other stuff, we got to see a lot of \'Zilla. He was looking in fine form. He even got in a couple of hero poses.For my money I wasn\'t too impressed. The devastation is so massive and so widespread it becomes numbing. Almost like it has no real value. Like, hey, it took 5 years and a billion dollars to build that building. But not just the buildings. It\'s not like you see the thousands, if not millions of lives lost and ruined. It\'s not like you see the global effects of this devastation upon the whole world because a major city was just flattened. It\'s just pancake a city and move on.I also had a problem with the plot. Like I said, the plot was advance by some misanthropes. I get tired of them. Not only do they seek to wipeout as many people as possible, they always have this altruistic sounding diatribe as if they\'re morally superior and know what\'s best (I\'m looking at you Thanos). I just want to yell, ""Shut up!"" But I can\'t because I\'m in a theater. Well, that and they can\'t hear me anyway. My point being that the human hating is getting old. It\'s time to come up with a new reason for wanting to kill so many people or at least revise the human hate speech.', '""Trick \'r Treat"" director Michael Dougherty\'s ""Godzilla, The King of the Monsters"" qualifies as the rare sequel that surpasses its impressive predecessor, ""Rogue One"" director Garth Edwards\' above-average, larger-than-life ""Godzilla"" (2014), with Bryan Cranston, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, and Elizabeth Olsen. Edwards\' ""Godzilla"" rebooted the American ""Godzilla"" franchise after ""Stargate"" director Roland Emmerich gave us his own entertaining epic ""Godzilla"" (1998), starring Matthew Broderick. While Emmerich\'s ""Godzilla"" was goofy fun, it spawned no sequels. In contrast, Edwards\' stomping, chomping reboot laid the groundwork for Dougherty\'s slam-bang, high-octane follow-up. Not only is ""Godzilla, King of the Monsters"" bigger and better, adding the wicked three-headed, space dragon King Ghidorah, along with Mothra and Rodan, but its human characters also are far more relevant than those in its forerunner. For a change, the scientists, their families, and their subordinates play a stronger, integral role in the storyline.Comparably, Dougherty\'s ""Godzilla"" is reminiscent of the Toho Studios\' 1968 vintage ""Destroy All Monsters,"" which featured Godzilla, Rodan, Mothra, Gorosaurus, Minya, and King Ghidorah. Interestingly enough, the villains in ""Destroy All Monsters"" were the Kilaaks, an alien race languishing on an asteroid planet orbiting between Mars and Jupiter. The Kilaaks gained control of these monsters and freed them from the confines of an island prison. Asserting control over their minds, the Kilaaks harnessed them as weapons of mass destruction to wipe out mankind. The fiendish Kilaaks teleported Godzilla and the other monsters from one metropolis to another to decimate the Earth. Similarly, in ""Godzilla, King of the Monsters,"" an army of murderous ecoterrorists release King Ghidorah from Antarctica and Rodan from a volcano to rout Godzilla and Mothra, so other chimerical behemoths like them, called the Titans, can restore the Earth\'s ecological prosperity. These ecoterrorists behave like Thanos in the ""Avengers"" movies. Despite the global apocalypse liable to ensue if they succeed, the Earth will undergo a makeover, and life will be far better for the survivors. These ecoterrorists insist that out of this tragic wholesale devastation, the Earth will flourish and return to an Eden-like paradise.Paleobiologist Emma Russell (Vera Farmiga of ""The Conjuring"") and her ex-husband Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler of ""Zero Dark Thirty"") have created an apparatus called the Orca that transmits frequencies which can influence the behavior of the Titans. This couple emerged from the catastrophe of San Francisco, but they lost their adolescent son, Andrew. Their daughter Madison (Millie Bobby Brown of Netflix\'s ""Stranger Things"") survived the ordeal and lives with Emma in a remote outpost in China established by Monarch, a billion-dollar governmental agency that monitors the Titans. As the film unfolds, Emma and Madison are about to see the birth of a larva, Mothra, when Alan Jonah (Charles Dance of ""Alien³"") and his eco-terrorists storm the premises. Mothra escapes before Jonah and his henchmen stop it. Nevertheless, they take Emma and Madison hostage along with the Orca. Monarch scientists Dr. Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe of ""The Last Samurai"") and Vivienne Graham (Sally Hawkins of ""The Shape of Water"") recruit Mark Russell to help them find his ex-wife and daughter. At this point, Mark urges Monarch to destroy Godzilla and all the Titans. Eventually, he realizes Godzilla isn\'t the problem, but perhaps represents the solution to their nightmare.Later, Mark is shocked to learn Emma has been conspiring with Jonah, and she believes the only salvation for life on Earth lies with the Titans. She helps Jonah release not only King Ghidorah, but also Rodan. Initially, King Ghidorah defeats Godzilla after an oxygen-destroying bomb is detonated during an Armageddon of a fracas. Godzilla takes refuge in a cavern to recuperate while Ghidorah dominates the planet. Dr. Serizawa replenishes the radiation the ailing Godzilla needs so it can confront King Ghidorah in a showdown. Madison steals the Orca from Emma and flees to her hometown, Boston, Massachusetts, where she broadcasts the Orca signals, and Godzilla rallies for the ultimate mêlée with King Ghidorah.Writer & director Michael Dougherty and ""Krampus"" scenarist Zach Shields, adapting a story each co-wrote with Max Borenstein of ""Kong: Skull Island,"" have conjured up a stupendous saga. Incredibly, these filmmakers have created a no-holds-barred magnum opus that alternates between spectacular bouts with legendary Japanese leviathans as well as two ideological factions of scientists intent on saving the world by virtually annihilating it. The collateral damage that the Titans inflict dwarfs anything in all of Marvel\'s ""Avengers"" movies. Amazingly, no characters get short-changed in this boisterous, PG-13 rated, 132-minute, extravaganza that keeps drumming up surprises atop surprises. At least three uppermost human characters sacrifice their lives to save Godzilla from his aggressive new adversary. Everything in ""Godzilla, King of the Monsters"" is enormous in both scale and scope. Monarch, the crypto-zoological coalition, has established outposts around the globe that serve as shelters for the Titans. The scientists clash with Congress over their mandate. These politicians demand to know if Monarch is trying to domesticate Godzilla as man\'s pet. Dr. Serizawa scorns this peculiar notion and explains mankind is really Godzilla\'s pet.Unlike the inferior special effects in the Japanese ""Godzilla"" movies, Warner Brothers and Legendary Pictures spent between $175 to $200 million reportedly to make the giant monster fights appear as lifelike as possible. Godzilla devours one of King Ghidorah\'s three heads, but the evil space dragon-a legendary hydra itself- grows another head. The producers have gone to melodramatic extremes to stage these monumental battles, and fans of the Japanese originals will appreciate Daugherty for making Godzilla sound like his venerable Toho Studios self. ""Black Sails"" composer Bear McCreary contributes a thoroughly atmospheric score that features traditional musical cues from original ""Godzilla"" composer Akira Ifukube. Actor Bradley Whitford blurts out several memorable one-liners about Godzilla, and sagacious Charles Dance makes an insidiously evil foe. ""Godzilla, King of the Monsters"" qualifies as an unforgettable experience. Furthermore, audiences should not evacuate the premises immediately, but wait until after the end credits. One brief but final scene ties up an important plot thread.', '. . . Heart of Darkness, and mandates that this so-called Pilgrim HQ be weakened at all costs. The always eponymous Warner Bros. warn America with GODZILLA: KING OF THE MONSTERS that Fenway Park\'s ""Green Monster"" MUST be totally nuked, eradicated, and reduced to rubble to thwart those cheating ""Red Sox."" A SPOTLIGHT already has shown ""Bean Town"" as a leading hotbed of a perverse Roman Sex Cult. GODZILLA basically implodes Fenway, while annihilating the rest of ""Back Bay,"" not to mention the ""Patriot Trail."" Plus, ""Organized Religion"" is ridiculed, lampooned, and trivialized by GODZILLA, which adopts the World View of Yankee philosopher H.P. Lovecraft. Whether your name is ""Comrade Saunders"" or ""Biding Time,"" Warner Bros.\' fearless prognosticating prophets caution the geriatric ogres of New England\'s Yesteryear to cram back into their clown car and buzz off! To sum up, GODZILLA sings a swan boat song for the Red Stockings, red-faced candidate geezers, red cardinals, and all the other SCOTUS crooks it catches out red-handed.', ""GODZILLA: KING OF THE MONSTERS is basically an updated version of MONSTER ZERO, mixed with DESTROY ALL MONSTERS, minus the aliens.First off, yes, the CGI is fantastic, and the monster clashes are spectacular, when they are shown. Unfortunately, the moviemakers decided that a modern, giant monster movie simply must have family drama. So, while Godzilla, Rodan, Mothra, King Ghidorah, and other behemoths crash about devastating whole cities, the Russell family squabbles with each other, yet hopes for the best. While the gargantuan beasts fight for ultimate supremacy, young Madison asserts her independence, proving to her parents that she's growing up.At times, it's as though Godzilla et al. are just big, lumbering bit players in their own movie! The most incredible example of this comes when Godzilla and King Ghidorah face off in Boston. During this apocalyptic annihilation, while buildings crumble and rubble sails all around, the Russells have a touching moment. Seemingly oblivious / impervious to the swirling hell around them, their eternal bond is deepened. Alas, in this movie's struggle for screen time, The Russell's win..."", ""Another addition to the so called 'Monsterverse', and another damp squib of a film, with very impressive effects.At least here, Dougherty sort of goes back to basics with the monster mashes, but they are few and far between, and all the filler is lots of incoherent exposition featuring a wealth of gifted actors who will be bad mouthing this film in the next couple of years.Apart from the titular creature, and some 'remember me from the other film' cameos, this film is a totally different 'beast' from Evans 2014 in carnation.Here we have thespian Charles Dance dressed for Jurassic Park, staring menacingly at people whilst holding a gun to someones head. That's him done in the film, and he's the best thing in it, because it's such a bizarre turn for him, even though he pops up in every turgid fantasy film released lately.Obliviously, Nuclear family is a key component of the narrative, with father trying to find estranged wife and daughter, but it's handles so poorly, you just yearn for a CG beast to blow something up.And when it happens, its impressive, but only if you catch it in on the biggest screen and in 3D, you may as well go all out for the spectacle.But although the Kaiju look like they are fighting in the same world as Fincher's Se7en, you cannot help but feel a little excited when Godzilla finally goes thermonuclear.But my word, it's a slog while the monster mash is absent.When the King and the God finally face off next year, this franchise will be extinct."", ""Too much of the same thing. The story and characters were not well developed. Just climax after climax. Explosions and fights seemed repetitive. Vera Farmiga's character seemed too smart to be so dumb. And Zhang Ziyi didn't deliver her lines convincingly.Destruction of cities wasn't well done. Just seemed superficial and far away.Waste of lots of effects. Spending more money doesn't mean a better movie. Sometimes less is more. A simpler movie like the Korean monster movie The Host was so much more involving because you were invested in the characters and the creature wasn't too big.Don't bother."", 'Third entry in the new ""Monsterverse"" franchise of Toho Monsters is the best yet, a magnificently realized, ecologically-minded film that is a direct sequel to 2014\'s ""Godzilla"", which sees our old titan-sized reptilian friend return to do battle with a would-be usurper to his monster crown, King Ghidorah, a three-headed alien titan bent on using other newly awakened titans like Rodan in its quest to be the new Alpha of the Earth, but Mothra is also present to assist Godzilla in its fight.Human characters(played by Kyle Chandler, Vera Farmiga, Millie Bobby Brown, Ken Watanbe, and Charles Dance) are present of course in various capacities, but this is a monster film, make no mistake, and never has it been more realistically and seriously achieved than here. Filled with many tributes and knowing nods to the original series of Toho studios Godzilla films from decades previous, this is a true love letter and dream come true for fans of those Japanese epics that may well look quaint now with the astonishing CGI available, but will still be cherished nonetheless.Future will hold Godzilla meeting Kong from ""Kong: Skull Island"" to see who will hold the monster crown. Whether or not other monsters like Gigan, Megalon, or Hedorah will appear is yet to be determined. Stay tuned through the closing credits though...', 'Dr. Emma Russell wakes up recalling the SF Godzilla rampage incident. Maddie, her daughter is in kitchen chatting with her estranged dad Mark Russell. Emma goes to a lab with daughter Maddie, they are in central China, at a Monarch Facility housing a giant moth larva. The moth stirs but Emma gets it to settle down by finding a correct frequency on her ORCA device, a packing case sized electronic apparatus. Suddenly, explosions and gunfire, a squad of soldiers come in and take Maddie and Emma and the device.Dr. Serizawa, Dr. Graham and Sam Coleman are being grilled by a US Govt Committee on what Monarch is doing. Serizawa says the research is important to coexist with the Titans. Suddenly he gets a call and has to leave, the Monarch trio depart.Mark Russell is in the woods sound recording wolves in a feeding frenzy. The Monarch leadership trio arrive by V22 Osprey and go back to his cabin. They show video clips of Maddie and Emma being taken. He agrees to go with them.After SF, the couple diverged, Emma doing research , Mark leaving it all behind, they had lost a son and separated leaving Maddie with mom. Mark had invented the ORCA device to communicate with killer whales, he was unaware Emma had been developing it for Titans.On an ocean platform Bravo near Bermuda Monarch has a large control center, they can track Godzilla as he travels in the oceans around the world. Suddenly the signals get stronger, Godzilla is approaching. Monarch readies weapons but Mark says to stand down,they power down weapons and open the blast shields. Godzilla swims close by seemingly staring at the humans inside, the titan then zooms off. Mark asks to see the tracks history and the they show Godzilla has been repeatedly going near the Monarch Antartica Base.Colonel Jonah Alan, a disaffected British soldier and his team assault the Antarctica Base, they kill the Monarch guards and force their way down, Monster Zero is entombed in ice. The soldiers plant explosives in the ice and prepare to detonate, they get word a Monarch team is approaching.The giant Monarch flying wing arrives and deploys several V22s, The aircraft land and soldiers get out and start a firefight with Col. Alan\'s mercenaries. Mark Russell follows at a distance. He makes it close to where the two groups have a standoff on a Gantry. Mark sees Maddie and urges her to come, she starts but Emma tells her to stay. Emma the presses the red button and detonates the explosives. The entire facility begins to collapse and the two sides scramble to escape. Col. Alan, Emma and Maddie make it to their V22 and lift off. Mark saves a group of soldiers and is a little later in getting to their aircraft.Meanwhile Titan Zero, a huge three-headed dragon breaks out of the ice, it notices the remaining V22 and approaches, ready to spew flames but Emma calms it down with her ORCA device from the hovering Osprey, then they fly off.Suddenly Godzillla appears and fights the larger three-headed monster. The Monarch team on the ground scramble to avoid being trampled. The Monster Zero manages to defeat Godzilla by pushing him into a crevice, kills Graham and flies off. The Monarch team is recovered. Mark says they have to find Godzilla.There are 17 Monarch sites at dormant Titan locations. The one in Mexico is showing some movement, the flying wing heads to Mexico. A giant black bird with flaming tail feathers climbs out of a volcano, Rodan. Mark urges Monarch to evacuate the 11,000 people living close to the Mountain. Monarch notices a large hurricane also moving to Mexico, it is Monster Zero which can somehow control the weather.V22 Ospreys rescue people and fight Rodan, the flying wing tries to draw Rodan toward Titan Zero. Rodan knocks down the V22 one by one. Rodan and Monster Zero battle which Monster Zero wins and blasts Rodan into the ocean. Monster Zero almost destroys the Argo but Godzilla again appears, tackles Monster Zero out of mid-air into the sea and starts fighting Monster Zero in the ocean. Admiral Stenz comes on and tells the Monarch flying wing to get clear, the military has launched an oxygen-depleting cruise missile at Monster Zero and Godzilla.One last Osprey calls a mayday, it is full of kids. Mark goes to the Landing Bay and ejects a parked Osprey making room for the craft, which manages a hard but safe landing inside the flying wing. Godzilla almost defeats Monster Zero as he bites off one head but the bomb hits the titans and explodes, a large explosion expands and the area is quietened. After a moment Monster Zero gets out of sea, missing a head and flies to the top of the volcano, screeching into the air. The decapitated head re-grows. Rodan flies to the volcano and bows to Monster Zero. The Monarch team lose Godzilla\'s signal and think it has died. Jonah asks Emma about releasing them gradually, one at a time. Emma, however, states she isn\'t doing this. Jonah then declares, ""Long live the king."" Madison calls Emma a monster.Back on Bravo, Monarch determines Monster Zero is King Ghidorah, the competition to Godzilla as the top apex predator on earth. All the other dormant Titans around to world start to awake and wreak havoc. Rodan and King Ghidorah team up and start destroying Washington D.C. Monarch scientist Ilene Chen explains Ghidorah is an extra-terrestrial with greater powers than the others.Mom makes a video call to Monarch to explain what she did. She thinks humans are over populating and destroying earth, releasing the Titans will restore the balance and save the planet. Mark and Monarch think she is crazy and has acted beyond her authority. Emma urges them to find bunkers to hideout until it\'s safe enough. Monarch decides to go look for Godzilla.In China the larva transforms to a large moth, the older Dr. Chen basking in the beauty of the friendly giant.Serizawa and Russell take a submarine and find a submerged city older than Egyptian ruins. Radiation keeps them back but a probe manages to get a photo of a sleeping Godzilla in a dry chamber. Serizawa volunteers to take a nuclear bomb to Godzilla to give him a healthy shot of energy. He takes a one man craft to the chamber, climbs up beside Godzilla, pats it\'s nose and says goodbye old friend in Japanese. The bomb explodes.The submarine surfaces and they lookout for signs on the surface. A large whirlpool starts and Godzilla comes out, the Titan comes close to the sub, peers closely, but leaves them alone then swims off. Back at Bravo, Mark wants to find Maddie and prepares to leave, but a bright light breaks through the rain, it is Mothra in all its glory.Maddie has also realized her mother is crazy and tries to stop her. Emma realizes they can use Boston\'s Fenway Park to send out a ORCA signal stopping the Titans, Col. Alan says no, they must see through the plan, even though Ghidorah\'s powers were more than expected.Maddie escapes the Monarch bunker, an old fallout shelter, with the Orcaa device. She makes her way to Fenway Park and plugs the equipment into the PA system, then starts broadcasting a signal.The Titans around the world stop, Ghidorah\'s goes toward Boston to find the signal.\nIt arrives in a hurricane and blasts the PA speakers, then looks into the stadium windows seeing Maddie. Maddie grabs the ORCA and tries to run for it. On the baseball field she loses the case and Ghidorah\'s is about to blast her when suddenly a blue blast knocks the three headed-monster down. Maddie looks and sees an angry Godzilla walking ashore with a supporting squadron of V22 firing rockets and the flying wing.Godzilla and Ghidorah now fight again in Boston, Mothra and Rodan fight in the air. Once again Ghidorah seems to get the better of Godzilla who is dropped from the atmosphere by Ghidorah and is left panting in the rubble. Mothra defeats Rodan by stabbing him with a stinger but is severely wounded and nearly killed during the battle. Mothra then tries to protect Godzilla from Ghidorah but Ghidorah kills Mothra. The Mothra particles float down onto Godzilla.The Monarch team go to find Maddie, they find the ORCA but not the girl. Meanwhile, Emma has had a change of heart and also arrives at Fenway Park, she saves the Monarch team and they escape in a Hummer, followed by Ghidorah. They try to give Godzilla, who is having his energy sucked out by Ghidorah, time to recover. The parents realize Maddie went to their old family home and go there, finding her in the ruins of the house. Maddie recovers and they plan to use the ORCA device again. A V22 arrives to take the team away, everyone but Emma get on, she stays on the ground and says sorry, she activates the ORCA, and drives away in a truck and Ghidorah blasts her the truck she is driving away in, injuring her. Mark and Maddie look on in grief.Godzilla recovers, now glowing red he fights again this time finally destroying Ghidorah. Rodan and other Titans that arrive in Boston and kneel before Godzilla. He stands high and mighty, the King of Monsters.']"
26,MonsterVerse,Godzilla vs. Kong,5034838,"[""The least of the new GODZILLA series. This one has an interminable storyline with half-hearted plotting, throwing bits and pieces from the Japanese films into a blender and trying to make sense of the garbage that comes out. The human cast is particularly dull and cookie-cutter predictable, from a random cute native girl to the stereotypical comedy relief and one-dimensional villains. I wasn't impressed with the CGI or the way Kong is humanised with incessant pop music, and it's only in the final third that this finally starts to look and feel like a real kaiju movie; the climax isn't bad, but it's a long time coming."", ""Kong is being kept under-the-dome living on Skull Island and he's not happy about it. Ilene Andrews (Rebecca Hall) is trying to keep him safe and away from Godzilla. Her adopted deaf daughter Jia communicates with him. Meanwhile, conspiracy blogger Bernie Hayes (Brian Tyree Henry) is investigating and working at Apex Cybernetics. Madison Russell (Millie Bobby Brown) is a fan and she tracks him down with Josh. Nathan Lind (Alexander Skarsgård) is a Hollow Earth expert. Oh yeah! There is the Hollow Earth, a magical axe, and a surprise villain.Honestly, I don't remember the previous movies. I don't know any of these characters. Non of them really matters anyways. I do like the idea of the little girl communicating with Kong. The movie should do more of that. BTH is a little fun as the conspiracy nut. His little Scooby gang has potential but it's not that great. The Hollow Earth is rather silly but whatever. It's stupid but kinda cool at the same time. The TRON ships are out of place. It's a tech mishmash. I don't really need a lot of the human story especially if it's not doing anything interesting. At the end of the day, this is a mindless popcorn flix and it's fine for being that."", 'My cousin called me this morning. He suggested this movie. I demurred. ""You\'ve got another movie in mind?"" he asked.I thought more about Saturday Night Wrestling on WNEW while watching this movie than I had in the preceding 60 years.Afterwards, we agreed to never speak of it again.', ""Godzilla vs Kong is wrestlemania. Two titans knocking seven bells out of each other and be the king of the ring.Godzilla has emerged after a few years away and attacked the headquarters of Apex Cybernetics. It's boss Walter Simmons (Demián Bichir) is up to no good and Godzilla knows it.Simmons is after a power source from Hollow Earth and needs Kong to help him find it.Kong is not happy as he is living in a virtual reality dome and he knows it. He communicates with a death girl by sign language but has a chance to go home, Hollow Earth.The story is basically Simmons is developing his own mechanical titan to teach Godzilla a lesson.As for the rest, Godzilla and Kong have a fight early on before there is a grudge rematch.The Warner Brothers Monsterverse have learnt their lessons. In Godzilla (2014) the monster hardly showed up in his own movie. In other films the action was in the dark.Here the titans fight in neon lit cities, skyscrapers come crashing down, human casualties are not even acknowledged.The problem the film faces is that both Godzilla and Kong are now seen as heroes and not villians.Each monster has their own fans. So the writers have an ace up the sleeve. A monster team up as they go after an even more powerful foe.The humans are the least interesting part of the movie. There are a couple of cute kids and nods to the previous movie. No need to spend money on A listers, save it for the CGI.This is the most fun of the Monsterverse. It gets the balance right, the villains are hissable enough and most of the humans are mainly background material."", 'They took the Kong from Skull Island, an excellent film plus the recent less than excellent Godzilla film and smashed them together into a confused mess. They simply tried to do too much. They take the basic titan fight and added ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"", ""Upside Down"" Kong as Indian Jones, ""Transformers"", a light saber Ax, teens save the world, and a little girl saves the world. The company Apex are the bad guys who are trying to do something good. Good visuals. Just a messed up plot.', 'Hands down the best of the Monsterverse! I have been kind to the previous Godzilla movies (the new ones that is, that are part of the Monsterverse), especially when it came to giving them slack due to issues with the human side of the story they tried to tell. I also felt that Kong Skull Island was a bit of a guilty pleasure! Many great actors, a lot of B-movie tropes and throwbacks and fun al around.But combining these two franchises (once again and with callbacks to the original clash from yesteryear ... many many years ago) and some of the actors involved while adding some new ones ... I can\'t even begin to express how great I felt this was. From the first frame ... when you see Kong himself, I felt this could be something amazing.Now don\'t get it twisted! This is not a character piece on humans - you will not find a lot of depth and might say that the villains motivation is quite paper thin ... but all you\'d do with that is deriving yourself of so much fun you could have. I was not a big fan of the new Snyder Cut of Justice League. It\'s good in places and has some issues in others - but I was and am happy for anyone who could just plain enjoy it.Why do I even mention this? Because there seems to be a lot of people not even having seen this movie but trying to bury it, because their feelings got hurt and they try to bully Warner into doing what they want. Generally speaking it is a good thing to listen to your fans ... but this has gone too far. And I talked about this as much as needed! Watch the movie before you rate it and be happy for anyone liking something, even if you can\'t share their feelings.As a big fan of the Original Godzilla movies and kaiju in general, I personally had no issues with the new Monsterverse going CGI. I know others have their problems with that. It will depend on how you feel. But the movie looks fantastic. Even if the ""story"" itself can\'t grab your attention and hold it - you can\'t deny how beautiful it looks.But it is not just that. Even though, there is not much plot and the humans are a side note ... actually why even though? It is the right and proper way to do such a movie! And the dialog is handled very well to say the least. Which comes down to the actors involved in this. Adam Wingard went ahead and did it! And he showed a lot of respect to the history of the franchise ... a movie that should be seen on the big screen if possible! It deserves praise for being as entertaining as it is ... Thank you Wingard, thank you Warner.', 'Well, not quite. I think those words, uttered by Dr. Ilene Andrews (Rebecca Hall) is what we all expected, but quite honestly, by not presenting an out and out winner, the franchise can live another day if the studios see fit. I wish I could say I was more impressed by the film than I actually was. It\'s definitely huge on the big budget special effects and CGI, but I had the sense there was something missing to make it truly epic. When Mechagodzilla was introduced I was slightly bummed, knowing that the attention would shift away a bit from the title\'s mighty Titans and have to deal with the creation of the Apex Cybernetlcs CEO, Walter Simmons (Demián Bichir). With Mechagodzilla whipping Godzilla around like a rag doll, it didn\'t say much for the superiority of the King of the Monsters, later reinforced when Kong pulled Mecha\'s head off with it\'s spine trailing, reminiscent of the giant ape in the 2005 ""King Kong"" remake by Peter Jackson. My favorite laugh out loud moment in the picture occurred when Nathan Lind (Alexander Skarsgård) used one of those \'hollow Earth aerial vehicles\' like a defibrillator to jump start Kong\'s heart to get him ready for the trip to Hong Kong. That was just too funny. All in all, a very much to be expected large scale spectacle to see on the big screen, but don\'t fool yourself into thinking that ""Godzilla vs . Kong"" implies a winner. That debate is far from settled.', ""Godzilla (2014) was the start of the MonsterVerse series, followed by Kong: Skull Island, and then Godzilla: King of the Monsters hinted what was to come. This is not the first time legendary monsters Godzilla and King Kong have fought each other, there was King Kong vs. Godzilla in 1962. Many were excited by this modern reboot, especially after the coronavirus pandemic delayed its release, directed by Adam Wingard (You're Next, The Guest, Blair Witch). Basically, five years since Godzilla defeated King Ghidorah, the Monarch corporation are monitoring Kong within a giant dome on Skull Island. Kong is visited by Jia (Kaylee Hottle), the last Iwi native and the adoptive daughter of Kong expert Ilene Andrews (Rebecca Hall), who is deaf and communicates with Kong via sign language. Apex Cybernetics employee Bernie Hayes (Brian Tyree Henry) is host of a Titan conspiracy theory podcast; he extracts data suggesting sinister activities at a Pensacola facility. However, Godzilla suddenly attacks the facility. Madison Russell (Millie Bobby Brown), who listens Bernie's podcast, enlists her friend Josh Valentine (Julian Dennison) to investigate Godzilla's sudden attacks. Apex CEO Walter Simmons (Demián Bichir) recruits former Monarch scientist Nathan Lind (Alexander Skarsgård), also a theorist on Hollow Earth, to guide a search for a power source into the Hollow Earth, the home world of the Titans. Nathan is initially hesitant as his brother died in a strong reverse-gravitational effect during an expedition to the Hollow Earth. Walter reveals that Apex has developed HEAVs (Hollow Earth Aerial Vehicles), specialized crafts that can withstand the pressure exerted by the gravity field, and he agrees to join the mission. Nathan meets with Ilene and convinces her to ask Kong to guide them through the Hollow Earth via an outpost in Antarctica. Nathan, Ilene, and an Apex team led by Walter's daughter Maia (Eiza González) board a modified barge escorted by the U. S. Navy that carries Kong, who is sedated and restrained. Godzilla attacks the convoy and fights with Kong but leaves after the ships disable their power and trick him into thinking they are destroyed. To avoid alerting Godzilla, Kong is airlifted to the entrance to Hollow Earth, and Jia convinces him to enter the tunnel while the team follows him in the HEAVs. Madison and Josh find Bernie, who joins their investigation. Sneaking into the wrecked Apex base, they discover a secret underground facility, and are inadvertently locked into an underground monorail transport to Apex headquarters in Hong Kong. There they unwittingly stumble on a test of Mechagodzilla, a large robotic machine that can be telepathically controlled through the neural networks from the skull of a severed Ghidorah head. The mechanical monster is to be controlled by Ren Serizawa (Shun Oguri), the son of the late Ishiro Serizawa, but is limp due to its power supply's limitations. Walter intends to harness the Hollow Earth's energy to increase Mechagodzilla's power. Kong and the team enter Hollow Earth where they find an ecosystem like Skull Island. They discover his species' ancestral throne room, with remains of an ancient war with Godzilla's kind and a glowing axe made from another Godzilla's dorsal plates. As they identify the power source, the code is sent to the Hong Kong Apex base despite Ilene's protests. Attracted by Mechagodzilla's activation, Godzilla arrives in Hong Kong, and sensing Kong, he directly drills a shaft to the throne room with his atomic breath. In the ensuing mayhem, Maia and the Apex team attempt to escape but Kong crushes their HEAV. Kong, Ilene, Jia, and Nathan ascend to Hong Kong, where Godzilla and Kong battle, destroying many skyscrapers in the process. Godzilla is initially overpowered by Kong, but Godzilla emerges victorious. Kong loses consciousness after being defeated by Godzilla. Madison, Josh, and Bernie are caught by security and taken to Walter. Despite Ren's concerns over the power source's volatility, Walter orders him to activate Mechagodzilla. Suddenly, Ghidorah's consciousness possesses Mechagodzilla, who kills Walter, electrocutes Ren and the starts to attack Hong Kong. Godzilla and Mechagodzilla battle, but Godzilla is overwhelmed. Nathan revives Kong by destroying the HEAV, causing a large jolt of electricity to stun him, and Jia convinces him to help Godzilla. As Mechagodzilla overpowers both Titans, Josh short-circuits Mechagodzilla's controls with Bernie's flask of liquor. Godzilla supercharges Kong's axe with his atomic breath, allowing Kong to destroy Mechagodzilla. Madison, Bernie, and Josh reunite with Mark Russell (Kyle Chandler), while Godzilla and Kong acknowledge each other before the two go their separate ways. Sometime later, Monarch has established an observation post in the Hollow Earth, where Kong now rules. Also starring Lance Reddick as Guillermin, Hakeem Kae-Kazim as Admiral Wilcox, and Ronny Chieng as Jay Wayne. The acting performances are fine, and the story is reasonable, but let's be honest, it's all about the title fight. It delivers exactly what you would expect, two giants of cinema brought together in a clash of the titans, and many large buildings destroyed, things blowing up and chaos all around, with fantastic special effects, it is better than I expected, a satisfactory and entertaining enough science-fiction monster movie. Worth watching!"", 'Right, well after that hollow movie experience that was the 2019 ""Godzilla: King of Monsters"", I must admit that my hopes for the 2021 ""Godzilla vs. Kong"" weren\'t exactly sky high. But still, knowing that if nothing else, then it would be a visual tour de force, then of course I sat down to watch this 2021 movie from director Adam Wingard.And yeah, ""Godzilla vs. Kong"" was exactly what I had believed it would be; and that being a movie that was fully devoid of a storyline that had just a grain of intellect behind it. And this movie is essentially a movie where you just disconnect your brain, lean back, grab the popcorn and just enjoy the visual effects. Sadly so, but I must applaud the CGI team behind ""Godzilla vs. Kong"", because they really worked their magic.The CGI in ""Godzilla vs. Kong"" were off the charts, just as expected of this movie. And the CGI team deliveres an in-your-face CGI galore here that is spectacular. I will go as far as saying that the movie is actually well worth watching for the special effects and CGI alone. I was completely blown away by the effects here, and the level of attention to detail was just grand.Just as with every other Godzilla movie in history, the human stories that they entwine into the battles between the Kaijus were insignificant, and I must say that the characters in this 2021 movie felt even more useless and pointless than ever before. I literally didn\'t care one bit for any of the characters, as they had the importance of paint on a wall, and had the same appeal. The characters felt like stand-ins milling about with no aim or purpose. And it was merely Kong and Godzilla that had any appeal in the movie. So names such as Alexander Skarsgård, Millie Bobby Brown, Kyle Chandler and so forth really had no moments to shine in this movie.""Godzilla vs. Kong"" was a movie that was set up to be a major movie, but I felt somewhat cheated out of a grand experience here. Sure, ""Godzilla vs. Kong"" was watchable and enjoyable enough for the brainless Kaiju mayhem that it was, but I can\'t help but sit here now that the movie ended and thinking \'was that really it?\'Again, moving back to the CGI team. I have to say that the final showdown between Godzilla and Kong, and then Godzilla and Kong against Mechagodzilla in Hong Kong was phenomenal. That scene alone more than made up for all the shortcomings that the movie was stacking in abundance. Having lived in Hong Kong, I must say that seeing this visual presentation of such destruction in that metropolis was just spectacular. Seriously, if for nothing else, then watch ""Godzilla vs. Kong"" for that scene alone.My 11 year old son and I watched ""Godzilla vs. Kong"" together and were mildly entertained. This wasn\'t a \'wow\' experience in any way, aside from the CGI and special effects. A shame really, because Godzilla has been on a downward slope ever since migrating to American soil.My rating of the 2021 ""Godzilla vs. Kong"" lands on a six out of ten stars, and this is solely and without the shadow of a doubt because of the CGI and special effects and the fact that Kong and Godzilla got to duke it out.', ""Godzilla vs. Kong opens with CGI Kong chilling in a CGI jungle and splashing around in a CGI waterfall. The mighty ape takes a CGI tree and throws it at the sky, shattering the illusion: he's really in a virtual reality containment area. At least that explains why nothing looked real. As you have probably guessed, I'm not a big fan of movies that rely heavily on never-quite-perfect computer generated effects, however, I am a fan of bonkers movies, and once I had resigned myself to the inevitable glut of digital trickery, I actually had fun with this gloriously silly kaiju blockbuster.It's possible to pick holes in the preposterous plot until the cows come home: from the moment two kids are able to track down a technology industry whistle blower who doesn't even have the sense to disguise his voice for his podcast, the film shows a distinct disregard for common-sense. But for me, that is the film's greatest appeal-it doesn't give a damn how daft it all becomes, never letting logic or the laws of physics get in the way of entertainment. And entertaining it most certainly is...Mighty lizard Godzilla is provoked to attack the HQ of high tech corporation Apex Cybernetics, resulting in destruction on a major scale. The company's top dog Walter Simmons (Demián Bichir) convinces Hollow Earth theorist Nathan Lind (Alexander Skarsgård) to join a mission to the middle of the planet in the search for a power source with which they can defeat Godzilla; in order to succeed, they need Kong to lead the way, and so the ape is released. With Kong freed, Godzilla launches an attack to become the 'alpha titan'.After a mid-ocean smackdown that leaves Godzilla mistakenly believing that he has won, Kong finally makes it to the Antarctic, where a tunnel leads to the hollow centre of the Earth. Deaf child Jia (Kaylee Hottle), who is able to talk to Kong via sign language, tells the ape that the tunnel leads to where he might find his family; when Kong heads for home, Lind and a team of scientists follow in anti-gravity ships capable of withstanding the perilous journey (and which are clearly a cinch to learn how to operate).What follows is utterly ridiculous (unless you're a Hollow Earth believer), as the ships arrive in the centre of the planet, which is home to all manner of monsters; ridiculous, but also hugely enjoyable. I particularly liked the bat-parrots that inhabit Kong's throne room (although I'm not quite sure what a throne room, statues and carvings are doing there-perhaps these relics of a once great civilisation will be explained in a future film).Power source located and secured, the scientists return to the surface (going out being a lot easier than going in), Simmons using his newfound energy to fuel his ultimate creation: Mecha-Godzilla! Unfortunately, all control of the giant mechanical monster is soon lost: cue the destruction of Hong Kong as Mecha-Godzilla attacks Godzilla, with Kong putting his differences aside to help the lizard fight the robot. Budget well and truly blown!Minor niggles: Hottle's perpetual 'raised eyebrows' concerned expression, and the fact that the kaiju appear to move in slow motion (it's always bothered me in other massive monster moves, but was particularly noticeable here. I understand that it's to give the creatures a sense of mass, but I find their movement a little 'off'). Still, it's a solid 7/10 from me - totally bonkers blockbuster entertainment."", 'Every review keeps bringing up the same issue with this film: the human interaction scenes are boring.Guess what? We watched about eighty kaiju movies in the last few weeks and can honestly tell you that every single one of those movies can claim just about the same thing, so the venerable Toho got smart and added aliens and ape humans from the future to those scenes, as well as miniature singing women who worship Mothra so that even the non-giant monster moments of their films are real strange.To those of you not able to name the four different eras of Godzilla films - Showa, Heisei, Millennium and Reiwa - let me tell you, the human moments in this are in no way as bad as All Monsters Attack.That said, you can literally remove Godzilla and every single human from this movie and you still pretty much could have the same story. This isn\'t Godzilla vs. Kong as much as it\'s another movie that we could call Kong: Inside the Hollow Earth. Actually, those moments, where Kong and a crew of good and bad scientists goes inside a gravity well to wind up in a Skartaris or Shangri-La or Savage Land inside our planet are some of the best parts of the movie, topped only by Godzilla somehow being able to blast nuclear fire from Hong Kong to the middle of Earth\'s core without destroying the entire planet.So, if we remove those moments of humanity - there\'s a whole conspiracy theory plot with Milly Bobby Brown, Brian Tyree Henry and Julian Dennison from Hunt for the Wilderpeople that exists merely to give us exposition, show off some conspiracy theory under the world trains and explain who the big bad really is.Yes, unlike every human bad guy who has ever gone up against a giant monster, it turns out that owning a big company like Apex Cybernetics and using scientific expeditions to make money never really pays off.Director Adam Wingard made You\'re Next and The Guest. If I hadn\'t looked up that he directed this, I would have never known. It\'s a writer\'s room-made film, with the last creative team making rewrites so that everyone is in character. And it\'s another part of the shared universe post-Marvel Cinematic Universe aesthetic, where every movie leads to the next, unlike the Toho films where fans were the ones to create a patchwork No-Prize narrative that barely connects them.That said, you can just enjoy the huge set pieces here, like Kong and Godzilla battling on the deck of an aircraft carrier and the final battle in Hong Kong. It looks like paintings come to life, the kind of battle between giant monsters that I could only dream of as a child satisfied with foam suits and zipped-in actors.Ishirô Honda, who directed the original King Kong vs. Godzilla and made a movie that satirized Japanese TV along the way, once said ""The reason I showed the monster battle through the prism of a ratings war was to depict the reality of the times. When you think of King Kong just plain fighting Godzilla, it is stupid. But how you stage it, the times in which it takes place, that is the thought process of the filmmaker.""So is this film dumb? Well, it was sold at some Carl\'s Jr. Restaurants with Godzilla hamburgers and Kong chicken sandwiches, the exact kind of commercialism that the Toho movie made fun of with Kong yaki noodles. But it is a big tentpole Hollywood movie in the weird second year of there not being a lot of places ready to show it.But hey, it does have monsters named Titanus Warbats and Kong gets a radioactive axe, so I can\'t be all huffy and say that I didn\'t enjoy it. I still have an entire shelf full of much better kaiju films - ask me, I\'ll recommend like twenty to you - to enjoy whenever I want, but today\'s children need a movie like this to get them excited the same way I was back in 1976, going crazy for Kong in theaters and Godzilla on UHF monster host shows.', 'My wife and I watched it at home on BluRay from our public library. This appears to be a highly updated remake of the 1963 ""King Kong vs Godzilla"" which itself was a Japanese movie edited for American audiences. This current one uses updated themes, like use satellite signals and a virtual reality device to control the Mechagodzilla.It has lots of deep bass, lots of well done computer graphics, and a somewhat entertaining story that requires Kong to be brought out of his protected habitat on Skull Island to battle Godzilla who seems to want to destroy Hong Kong.Mildly entertaining especially for those who enjoy action overload.', ""The visuals are great, and the story is write engaging. However, I'm quite annoyed by the portrayal of Hong Kong. The buildings aren't lit up like that, and it's clear that none the extras are not from Hong Kong."", 'The earth again will face the chance of total annihilation as Godzilla and Kong, the two most powerful forces of nature, are manipulated into a spectacular clash for the ages. A human conspiracy threatens to erase two iconic adversaries from the face of the earth forever. Story line can be very confusing. Action loaded science fiction fantasy.Filling out the cast: Alexander Skarsgard, Demian Bichir, Rebecca Hall, Kyle Chandler, Elza Gonzallez, Lance Reddick and Kaylee Hottle. Featured in the soundtrack: Judas Priest, The Hollies and Elvis Presley.', 'This movie delivered as promised, Godzilla and King Kong duking it out. The storyline was a bit far fetched... but can you really expect anything less? All things put together it was pretty good, the cgi and cinematography were amazing to watch.', 'I don\'t know if this is the wrap up movie or not, but I\'m sure the big cities of the world would be happy if it was. From 2014 till now Godzilla and friends have killed hundreds of thousands of people and caused trillions of dollars in damage--not to mention the billions of the U. S. defense budget spent on bombs and jets just to tick Godzilla off.But this is ""Godzilla vs. Kong,"" the main event. Some of the younger less informed crowd may believe this is a first. It\'s not. I remember seeing Godzilla and King Kong duke it out as a kid. It was epic. Those fights were a lot less costly.Who would win the fight is what we all wanted to know right? Smart money would\'ve bet on Godzilla, but GvK tried its best to make King Kong a sympathetic character thereby deserving to win. King Kong had a special link with a deaf girl named Jia (Kaylee Hottle) which automatically makes King Kong the David in his fight against Goliath. The relationship between them was a little weird and a lot dangerous. Jia\'s mom (or guardian), Ilene Andrews (Rebecca Hall), seemed to have no problem with her young daughter (or charge) fraternizing with a 100 foot gorilla. Friendly or not, accidents happen.Bad parenting aside, we got the fight that was promised. I didn\'t enjoy it nearly as much as I expected and the city of Hong Kong didn\'t enjoy it at all. The CGI is top notch even if the plot isn\'t. At this point there are no more fights left to be had and to concoct one would just be wrong.', 'Anybody who enjoys ""Godzilla"" movies should crave director Adam Wingard\'s ""Godzilla vs. Kong,"" a bizarre, sci-fi, fantasy that pits the eponymous Titans against each other for their second historic cinematic showdown. Initially, in 1962, these adversaries clashed in Japanese director Ishirô Honda\'s ""King Kong Vs. Godzilla"" but neither opponent could claim victory. Contrived as Wingard\'s ""Godzilla"" entry is in the Warner Brothers/Legendary Pictures\' Monsterverse franchise, ""G vs. K"" doesn\'t end in a stalemate! Remember, death isn\'t perpetual in sci-fi as Hollywood has shown us. Writers Eric Pearson of ""Thor: Ragnarok"" and Max Borenstein of ""Godzilla"" (2014) have whipped up a super-sized smackdown with several surprises based on a story by Terry Rossio of ""Godzilla"" (1998) and Michael Dougherty & Zach Shields of ""Godzilla, King of the Monsters"" (2019). Of course, the ideal spectator will eagerly embrace this nonsense with nothing short of enthusiasm, no matter how staggering its outlandish shenanigans are. Moreover, the global arena for this PG-13 epic gives these opponents more than enough elbow room. Wingard and his scribes spout Hollow Earth theory when the two Titans aren\'t clashing in gladiatorial creature feature violence. Seven minutes shy of two hours, this ""Godzilla"" installment introduces another fabled monster from the Japanese Toho franchise as well as a newbie from the Warner Brothers/Legendary Monsterverse. Unlike the WB\'s first ""Godzilla"" (2014) where shadows shrouded the king-sized kaiju during his nocturnal depredations, ""G vs. K"" has the terrible twosome tangling in broad daylight for maximum impact. The roving sea battle and the horrendous battle royal in downtown Hong Kong are splendidly orchestrated without any inclement weather obscuring the view.""Godzilla vs. Kong"" unfolds on Skull Island where the huge ape resides in idyllic splendor, perhaps a little too idyllic. Uprooting a tree, Kong strips away its branches and then hurls it like a javelin into the sky. Surprise of surprises, this crudely fashioned lance impales itself improbably in the heavens to reveal the presence of an immense bio-dome. The lance shattered some of the panels, like a brick smashing a plate-glass window. Kong has been confined within this colossal enclosure for his own safety. He is in the same predicament Jim Carrey faced in ""The Truman Show"" (1998). Basically, Monarch has designed the bio-dome to protect him from his sworn enemy Godzilla. Updating the Kong legend, the writers reveal Kong and Godzilla have been foes since the dawn of history. Allusions to their rivalry appear in many sacred ancient texts of dead civilizations. An anthropologist, Ilene Andrews (Rebecca Hall of ""The Town""), has spent ten years on Skull Island studying Kong. A deaf, indigenous, young native girl, Jia (newcomer Kaylee Hottle), rescued by Kong after a cataclysmic storm wiped out all the natives, lives with Andrews now. Jia uses sign language to communicate with Kong, but she hasn\'t told Andrews that they understand each other.Meantime, sinister Apex Cybernetics Corp. Founder & CEO Walter Simmons (Demián Bichir of ""Lowriders"") approaches a disgraced geologist, Dr. Nathan Lind (Alexander Skarsgård of ""Straw Dogs""), who has published a book about Hollow Earth Theory. Simmons recruits Lind to comb those subterranean realms for an energy source which mankind can use to thwart Godzilla\'s future depredations. What better guide than King Kong to escort Lind and company through those provinces? Kong trusts only Jia, and Jia assures Kong that his ancestors hailed from Hollow Earth. The opening to the fabled land lies via an icy portal in Antarctica. Meantime, Godzilla wreaks havoc when the kaiju raids an Apex lab at its Pensacola, Florida, facility in an apparently unprovoked attack. Discretion prevents me from revealing the real reason behind Godzilla\'s attack because it would ruin a major revelation. In another subplot, conspiracy theory podcaster Bernie Hayes (Brian Tyree Henry of ""White Boy Rick""), who works for Apex, has been biding his time before he blows the whistle on Simmons. Madison Russell (Millie Bobby Brown of ""Godzilla, King of the Monsters"") and her geeky computer bud Josh (Julian Dennsion of ""Deadpool 2"") join Bernie. Our heroes are horrified when they discover Apex has been incubating those hideous Skull Island Skullcrawlers at its Pensacola plant. No, Godzilla didn\'t raid the facility simply to annihilate the Skullcrawlers.The voyage to Antarctica finds a restless Kong shackled to the deck of a ship and later hoisted aloft by helicopters. Initially, an armada of U. S. Navy warships provide an escort for Kong. Since he is no longer entombed on Skull Island, Kong finds himself at the mercy of Godzilla. Those wicked dorsal fins ripple the surface of the ocean as Godzilla ploughs a path through the phalanx of ships, sinking some along the way on a collision course for Kong. Indeed, it looks like curtains for Kong. Happily, somebody removes Kong\'s giant shackles, and the two gargantuans generate a typhoon of terror. This briny blue brawl constitutes little more than a warm-up act, but Godzilla fans will shadow box with each blow they swap. One classic moment has Kong clobbering Godzilla with a spectacular right cross.If you\'re counting the films in the WB/Legendary Pictures\' Monsterverse, ""Godzilla vs. Kong"" qualifies as the fourth. The Monsterverse doesn\'t observe chronological order. Garth Edwards\' ""Godzilla"" (2014) emerged first and tagged the monsters as Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms, a.k.a. MUTOs or Titans. ""Kong: Skull Island"" (2017), the ""Godzilla"" sequel/prequel spanning World War II to 1973, bowed second. In ""Kong: Skull Island,"" President Truman created the ultra-secret government agency Monarch to maintain tabs on the MUTOs. Basically, Monarch runs through the franchise like a thread. ""Godzilla, King of the Monsters"" (2019) picked up after ""Godzilla,"" and ""Godzilla vs. Kong"" follows in the aftermath. Mankind\'s obligatory meddling with nature triggers far-reaching complications. Essentially, the Monarch vs. Apex rivalry separates good humans from evil. The preposterous hocus-pocus that drives this titular showdown takes its cues from the ""Alien"" film franchise with its paranoid corporation. Altogether, ""Godzilla vs. Kong"" surpasses itself when our monstrous rivals put up their dukes and knock each other for loops.', 'The 4th in the series of reimagined monsterverse movies finally sees Kong and Godzilla brought together. In the mythology of this series they are both on our side, kinda, as ""Titans"", avatars of worldwideworthness, but they are also huge rivals. In particular, Big G can sense Kong leaving Skull Island: apparently he needs to go home to get an upgrade, and home is apparently the hollow centre of the Earth. We also have a number of human factions, all of whom have their own agendas.There is quite a lot of apparent plot here, but much of it is unnecessary and irrelevant. However, it is nicely played by a good cast (no Nick Fury, Captain Marvel or Loki, but we do have the lady baddie from Iron Man 3). There is also a great deal of utter, utter nonsense: Florida to Hong Kong by secret high speed underground tube travel in what appears to be 10 minutes, anyone?But, of course, this is all about a pair of 400 foot tall antagonists beating the snot out of each other, and that is there in abundance. Hong Kong will never be the same. And, unlike the first in this series, you can actually see what\'s going on.It really is the most ludicrous tosh but, even while I was shaking my head at how preposterous it was, there were times when I felt like cheering.This is hugely enjoyable big-budget trash cinema.', ""Though it's the big lizard who receives top billing in 'Godzilla vs. Kong (2021)', make no mistake that this is the latter's film. The oversized ape is probably the closest thing the piece has to a protagonist, as its battles are all told from his perspective and the human characters all just sort of blend into two sides of the same coin. Picking up after the events of 'Godzilla: King of The Monsters (2019)', the picture focuses on a group of scientists who want to find a mysterious power source located in a strange 'hollow earth' that resides inside the planet's core and decide that they need a tour guide - a giant, hairy tour guide. That's where Kong comes in, as he's carted off to the entrance to this strange land and asked to follow his natural instincts inside. At the same time, Godzilla has seemingly turned against humanity when he begins to attack Apex facilities. An obsessed podcaster and one of the two characters to return from the Monsterverse's last outing think that there may be more to this, though, and engage in a bit of old-fashioned corporate espionage. These two plot threads exist almost in isolation with one another for the majority of the picture's run-time. In fact, the latter just feels plain unnecessary in the moment, distracting from what seems to be the main focus of the narrative. In the end, the two strands weave together fairly nicely in a finale that puts everyone more or less in the same location, but - even in retrospect -it all still feels a little inelegant. As does the narrative in general, to be honest. It's almost paper-thin, perpetuated by flat characters and jargon-filled pseudo-science, and clearly only exists as a way to get these two titans to duke it out. Of course, most people don't come to this kind of thing expecting to see top-tier character development or theme-driven storytelling. It's just that these things are sorely missed, even if only subconsciously, because all the large-scale punch-ups in the world can't make you care about a film filled with boring characters and a half-baked story. Still, the action is rather enjoyable. It's brought to life with brilliant visual effects and is choreographed so that you can actually see what's going on (the days of the Monsterverse hiding its monsters are, thankfully, over). Though the original 'Godzilla' and 'Kong' films may hold a special place in your heart, you can't deny that these big boys have never looked better. When they're punching and clawing and scraping and roaring, the picture is definitely at its best. It's entertaining and does exactly what it needs to do. That's why, overall, the film just about stumbles into 'decent' territory. There are elements of its human drama that work quite well, but for the most part it's still lacking - as it has been for the past three films - and some of the the affair's writing is straight-up terrible (one line literally made me audibly wince). Yet, its building-toppling brawls are fair bit of fun and are visual treats, to boot. It's not a great experience, but it's good enough for what it is. At least we can see what's going on this time, too. 6/10."", ""I'm the exact demographic for these types of movies. I love watching giant monsters fight each other. And i don't mind stupid mindless action flicks. But man. Just like with kong skull island and godzilla king of the monsters, this is a really bad movie with some good action.It's completely formulaic with 20+ cardboard characters trying (unsuccessfully) to pull off the marvel formula. But the MCU has good stories and great characters.The sad part is, I am reviewing this 2 days after i watched it, and i remember almost nothing from the movie. When i saw the name Alexander Skarsgård, i had to think about who he was in the movie. Nothing about this movie is memorable..... not even the action scenes. The visuals were great and it was mostly clear, but none of it was special. None of it made my jaw drop, which is VERY common for me.

Kong\'s harder because 1933\'s King Kong is an absolute classic and still holds up almost a century later. But I might call this the best Kong movie, as well.(Helps ALL of the King\'s sequels/remakes and appearances have been meh for the most part. EXCEPT Kong: Skull Island.)I\'m totally rambling here - something I try to avoid doing in my reviews, but damnit...this was so incredible. Even at 2 hours with some definite downtime with clichés, the time FLEW by and I had SO MUCH FUN. My biggest regret, however, was not seeing this for the first time in theatres. This SCREAMED IMAX and hopefully, with my second vaccination coming soon...I could fulfill that dream...I digress! As set up in the previous movies (2014\'s Godzilla, Kong: Skull Island and 2019\'s Godzilla: King of the Monsters,) Godzilla turns bad in the beginning. Or is he? Meanwhile, Kong\'s been monitored since the events of...Look. They meet, they mash, it\'s in the title. That\'s all anyone, including myself, cares about.And the fight between the two...BEST ""VS."" MOVIE EVER! And this is coming from a fan of Freddy vs. Jason, Alien vs. Predator (yes, and Requiem, as well!) and even more controversially, Batman v Superman (but, mainly the Ultimate Edition.) This fight was so perfect, so colorful and everything preceding their battle leads you to believe their actions fit the two mammoth alpha predators.It was very nice they actually made Kong into an actual character and while hundreds of thousands of innocents die around him, you still root for him. And as for Godzilla, well, when he\'s on screen, he\'s badass. (And he\'s got some moves in him, as well.)You\'ll have to suspend your disbelief a ton, but remember: we\'re not just dealing with giant monsters, but one of them from the series is an alien. So, pretty much, anything goes here.I can\'t express how much fun I had here. There\'s even a surprise I hope no one ruins for you that really services both the fans of decade\'s past and ties the whole movie together. This isn\'t really a leave your brain at the door...but it is the definitive entertainment popcorn movie that accomplishes the goal the title promised.Recommendation? Well, it\'s the MUST-SEE FIGHT OF THE CENTURY.***Final thoughts: The Monsterverse isn\'t that big, but here goes, my ranking of best to still darn good:1. Godzilla vs. Kong 2. Kong: Skull Island (an almost tie with #1) 3. Godzilla (2014) 4. Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019, also an almost tie with #3)', ""Starting from length of this movie. It has this gold time when it's not too short and not too long so viewer not getting bored watching it. I loved visuals and colors. It looked amazing, something you want to see in nowadays. Another key point I liked was actors. It wasn't fulfilled with famous actors(except from girl from Stranger Things), so they gave opportunity to other ones to show their talent. Interesting thing, Millie Bobby Brown's acting wasn't looking as professional as other and I love her, so maybe she wasn't best fit for this character. The plot line was somewhere good but I believed they've wasted time on negligible details and they had to rush ending. To sum up, my expectation was lower than this film shown, so I'm happy. I've seen about 30 movies in this year and so far it's my second favorite. I would recommend to watch it for action lovers."", ""The films in this new monster universe haven't impressed me much at all thus far, but the action does seem to be consistently entertaining. With Godzilla vs Kong, it's no different. Do I care about a single moment of human characters during this film? Absolutely not. Is the action exceptionally good? 100%. And that's just how these films go unfortunately. Take that for what you will.6.5/10."", ""Visual effects have definitely improved since King Kong vs. Godzilla (1962). However, the storytelling in these movies hasn't. Yes, Godzilla vs. Kong has some really fun battles that probably need to be seen on a big screen, but the plot was so silly & contrived that I lost interest whenever humans were on the screen. I don't think I'll watch this one again, but I would be interested in seeing a highlight reel of the fights on IMAX."", 'Take away the CGI and the A-list cast and you end up with film with less punch than almost any Disney movie from the 1960s.', ""Five years after Godzilla killed his extraterrestrial nemesis Ghidorah, he and Kong are currently the last known active Titans on the Earth's surface. Monarch now watches over Kong, who resides within a giant dome. He is visited by Jia, the last Iwi native and the adopted daughter of Dr. Ilene Andrews, who is deaf and can communicate with Kong via sign language.Bernie Hayes, a former employee of Apex Cybernetics and host of a Titan conspiracy theory podcast, exfiltrates information suggesting sinister activities at a Pensacola Apex facility. However, Godzilla suddenly attacks the facility; during the rampage, Bernie discovers a device that resembles the ORCA, previously used to communicate with or control Titans.Madison Russell enlists her friend Josh to investigate the cause of Godzilla's attack. Together, they find Bernie and sneak into the wrecked Apex base, discovering a secret facility deep underground. The trio are inadvertently locked and transported in a container carrying Skullcrawler eggs, two-legged reptilian megafauna that was previously discovered by Monarch, through an underground tunnel to Hong Kong.There, they unknowingly intrude on a test of Mechagodzilla, a mechanical version of Godzilla, telepathically controlled by Ren Serizawa, the son of the late Ishiro Serizawa, through the neural networks of Ghidorah derived from a severed head that Apex had managed to retrieve. The test is cut short due to limitations of the power supply. Walter Simmons, CEO of Apex, intends to harness to power of an energy source in the Hollow Earth, an underground world that is below the Earth and the secret home to the Titans, to overcome the limitations of Mechagodzilla.Walter recruits Nathan Lind, a former Monarch scientist turned theorist on the Hollow Earth, as a guide in search of a new power source within the Hollow Earth. Although Nathan is initially hesitant because his brother tried to explore Hollow Earth but a strong anti-gravity field inside the tunnel killed him, he agrees after Walter reveals that APEX has developed HEAVs, specialized crafts to withstand the pressure exerts by the gravity field which killed Nathan's brother.Nathan goes to Skull Island and meets with Ilene, convincing her to let Kong guide them through the Hollow Earth. Nathan, Ilene, and an Apex team led by Walter's daughter Maya board a modified barge with Kong chained and lightly sedated. However, Godzilla attacks the convoy midway through the voyage and defeats Kong, but only retreats after the ships disable their power and trick him into thinking they are destroyed. Realizing that Godzilla will continue to come for Kong if he is deemed a threat, they change plans and airlift Kong to a Hollow Earth entry point in Antarctica. Jia convinces Kong to enter the tunnel and the team follows him in the HEAVs.Inside Hollow Earth, they find an ecosystem similar to Skull Island. While traversing through the landscape, Kong and the team discover his species' ancestral throne room that depicts an ancient war with Godzilla's kind; they also find a glowing axe made from the dorsal plates of another Godzilla. Kong discovers that the power source can recharge the axe. The Apex team sends the power source's signature back to their base in Hong Kong, but Godzilla, sensing the energy, makes landfall in Hong Kong and directly attacks the throne room. Maya and the rest of the Apex team are killed by Kong whilst avoiding Godzilla's attack.Kong and the survivors, Ilene, Jia and Nathan, escape through the hole to Hong Kong, where Godzilla and Kong fight again. The battle ends with Kong being overpowered and severely injured by Godzilla.In the Apex base, Ren warns Walter that they have not tested the new Hollow Earth energy source, fearing the consequences. However, Walter ignores his pleas and orders him to activate Mechagodzilla. Bernie, Madison, and Josh are caught by security and brought to Walter. Mechagodzilla goes haywire under the influence of the energy source and Ghidorah's neural networks, electrocuting Ren to death. Mechagodzilla completely awakens and kills Walter, emerging from the base of Victoria Peak to attack the city.Godzilla and Mechagodzilla battle, with Godzilla quickly becoming overwhelmed due to exhaustion from his previous battle with Kong.

27,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Iron Man,371746,"['I finally saw this movie last night on DVD. Despite doing exceptionally well at the box office, I just never was that interested in seeing IRON MAN and only watched it after a friend gave me the DVD. In hindsight, I am glad I saw it, but think you should know at the onset that I am not a huge fan of superheros and comic books. This means that the film did manage to win me over but also that I have no knowledge of the story nor do I have the devotion to it that a typical fan might have. Take this for what you will.Since there have been a bazillion reviews for this film already, mine will be rather short and I won\'t even bother discussing the plot--others have already done this very well. Instead, let\'s first talk about what I liked. The film was very slickly made and I really enjoyed the first 3/4 of the film. The Iron Man character and how he came to be was original. Also, I was thrilled that Gwynneth Paltrow\'s character was NOT like the one she played in SKY CAPTAIN (uggh)--having a tiny bit more depth and not behaving as stupidly. Robert Downey was very good as a world-weary jerk who grows as a result of his near death. What I didn\'t particularly like was Jeff Bridge\'s character--it just wasn\'t interesting and Bridges seemed awfully one-dimensional. Additionally, while I am sure fans loved the final portion of the film, it was a let down for me because it was all action. The previous 3/4 of the film was bolstered by good writing and dialog, but the end was all special effects. Still, I must admit that they were very, very good special effects.Final verdict--A very good comic book film but not quite as well made or as interesting as THE DARK KNIGHT.FYI--The character ""Pepper Potts"" appears to be a homage to the ladies played by the Monty Python actors in their series. Series regular, Graham Chapman, coined the term ""Pepperpot"" to refer to these dowdy and severely unattractive middle-aged ""ladies"".UPDATE 7/2010--I just re-saw this film and the second time I was even more impressed with it. Robert Downey\'s great performance, the terrific soundtrack and the wonderful plot--it\'s simply an amazing film.', ""When it comes to ranking the Marvel superhero(live action) films, Iron Man is for me up there with the better ones. It looks fabulous, the whole film is very slickly made with top-notch special effects(which look like time and effort was really put into it), awesome-looking futuristic gadgets and Iron Man's suit will be a guaranteed delight to anybody who is familiar or loves anything to do with the superhero. There is a pulsating soundtrack that adds much to the tension of the first half of the story and the enormously fun action sequences, which are exciting and tense with expertly choreography. The script crackles with smart humour that doesn't go overload, all of which is laugh-out-loud funny, yet the hostage plotting that takes up the first part of the film is intelligently written and somehow avoids being over-serious or over-familiar. The story has enough to allow you to emotionally connect with Iron Man(who I've always considered one of Marvel's most interesting and multi-faceted characters) and has a clever mix of the comic's 1960s origins and the effects of contemporary war, which will provide plenty of nostalgia while also feeling relevant. Jon Favreau does a great job directing, he never loses control of the story and he doesn't do anything too fussy. Robert Downey Jnr's performance as Tony Stark/Iron Man is a power-house and one of his best, doing much with the smart dialogue while making the emotional side of the characters wholly believable. Gwyneth Paltrow is a good, loyal side-kick with wise-cracks that don't come across as annoying and Jeff Bridges is surprisingly very good in an against-type role. Personally, the only disappointments were the useless character of Christine Everheart and the somewhat rushed and over-blown finale that wasn't quite as thrilling as it could have been, other than that Iron Man was a classy addition to the Marvel cannon and a great film on its own. 9/10 Bethany Cox"", ""From what I can see of Iron Man, he's different from other superheroes in two respects. First he's quite the vulnerable one and second he's put together with extreme, but very human intelligence. Nobody came to Earth with powers and abilities far beyond mortal men. No one got their DNA mixed up with some animal to give them some extra-sapien traits. No Iron Man is put together in a laboratory after a prototype is done while in captivity in a cave.That's probably both the strength and weakness of this film. Robert Downey, Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow and most of all Jeff Bridges look like they're having a great old time putting flesh and bone on comic strip characters. I'm glad they enjoyed it, I didn't enjoy it as much as I normally do these kind of films.Iron Man is updated to today's world situation, but with some Thirties flashbacks because it's an arms dealer who is the chief villain here. Downey is like Bruce Wayne, a multimillionaire heir to an armaments fortune who likes to have a good time as well as work while Bridges minds the company day to day. But that MIT education did not go for naught as those Afghan terrorists found out. Downey proves as resourceful as B.A. Baracus of the A-Team in developing the Iron Man first to escape captors and then to defeat bad guys. And these bad guys are quite in league.But while the special effects are nice and the players are having a good time, Iron Man reminded me of a Popeye cartoon. Downey and Bridges looked Popeye and Bluto in the best two out of three falls. All that Downey needed to do was reach for that can of Spinach.I half expected he would."", 'Hollywood crowd-pleaser or vapid ego-fest for all those concerned? My money\'s on the latter, but a lot of people seem to rave over this comic book adaptation that sees a Howard Hughes-style inventor making himself a metal suit and using it to fight various nefarious characters. In recent years I\'ve seen the superhero genre on the wane, with boring and predictable outings lacking the spark that earlier hits enjoyed (such as SPIDER-MAN and DAREDEVIL, although I know I\'m in the minority in liking the latter). IRON MAN to me was routine, overlong and frequently dull, telling the \'samey\' kind of origin story we\'ve been seeing since whenever, and definitely lacking in entertainment value.It didn\'t help that Tony Stark\'s character grated on me from the beginning. We\'re supposed to believe this arrogant weapons manufacturer has a change of heart and wants to do good for the world, all the while retaining his quirky charm. Puh-lease! In actual fact, I was on the side of the (unrecogniseable) Jeff Bridges, cast here as the mentor-turned-villain. Bridges was the only one in the film who seemed to have the right idea what to do with Stark, i.e. beat seven shades of hell out of him.The plot plods along, taking trips to the Middle East along the way for some bloodless hijinks that see Stark building himself a suit of iron out of a few left-overs. BLUE PETER for guys, if you will. It also returns to the area later on for a rather entertaining fight sequence, but action and pretty special effects alone can\'t win the day for Stark. After the umpteenth confrontation, we\'re left with the sight of two metal men beating the tar out of each other in a climax lifted from ROBOCOP 2, and the ending drags on forever. Sadly, Stark ends up saving the day, which means that a sequel was greenlit.Other things working against the film: Gwyneth Paltrow\'s robot-like performance as ""Pepper Potts"", with whom Stark\'s character shares mucho dull flirtation. What did Hollywood ever see in this actress? Terrence Howard\'s military man is as dull as dishwater, and the only minor moments of fun come from watching our hero make implausible use of his engineering skills. But then, if I wanted to see that, I\'d rather plump for SCRAPHEAP CHALLENGE, I think.', ""Iron Man (2008) *** 1/2 (out of 4)Industrialist Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) is forced to build an armored suit in order to escape from a group of terrorists but after reaching safety he decides to use technology to help people. I never was a comic book movie guy but my opinion on them has changed over the past couple years since directors and screenwriters decided to throw some brains into the film. Here's another fine example of a film that has something to say and doesn't just resort to non-stop action and slapstick violence. The movie is extremely well made, wonderfully acted and contains some great special effects and that makes it one of the better films of its type. I think the key to this film working is the performance by Downey, Jr. who makes you feel as if everything you're watching could really happen. I think a lot of times you really have to suspend your disbelief but that's not the case here because Downey is so great that you feel he really knows how to create this suit and make it work. I loved the early scenes before the terrorist attack when Downey uses his comic skills because this shows what a changed man he is after he is able to escape. The supporting cast is also very good with Terrence Howard and Jeff Bridges doing fine work, although I felt both of their characters could have been written better. Gwyneth Paltrow is the one who really shocked me because I had seen many of her artsy films and was shocked at how well she could handle this material. The chemistry between her and Downey is great and adds a lot of suspense to the film especially in the final minutes. Favreau does a wonderful job with his directing duties and manages to keep the story movie and to keep the viewer entertained even though the final Iron Man doesn't show up until a hour into the film. I'm not a fan of CGI because I feel most directors don't know how to use it but that's not the case here because the effects fit in well with the story and they never try to be the main focus of the film."", ""Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is a hard playing billionaire genius. He is captured in Afghanistan after demonstrating his newest weapon. He is forced to create new weapons for his captor. Instead he makes an armored suit to escape. He also makes an arc reactor to keep his heart going and shrapnel from killing him. Once back in the States, he moves his company to concentrate on arc reactor technology and stop weapons manufacturing.This is all RDJ. He and he alone makes Iron Man work. It's doubtful if anybody could have done it better. It's certain that he's made it next to impossible to replace him. Director Jon Favreau has built around him the dazzling array of tech fun, and Gwyneth Paltrow as his Girl Friday. It is RDJ's fast talking, quick wit, and personal history that makes him the perfect Tony Stark. Great character, fun movie."", ""I got a kick out of this film. I have never seen one of the comic books nor do I know about the exploits of this figure. It is a nicely done superhero film which traces the origins of the character. Robert Downey is quite good, balancing his innate arrogance against his good intentions. Jeff Bridges is also an excellent adversary. One of the most impressive scenes in the move is the opening in the deserts of Afghanistan as a roadside bomb explodes and Downey and a group of soldiers come under fire. It really gives one a sense of what those people face each day. It may even be a bit real for a fantasy romp like this is. It is down and dirty. There are great events, including the building of the first suit and his effort to exact revenge against the forces that have used his weapons systems to persecute and destroy the civilian population. There is a lot of action and it's not superfluous. Downey's relationship with Gwyneth Paltrow and the robots in his lab are a lot of fun. For pure escapism, it's really fun. I assume the sequel is on its way."", 'I am far to be fan of comics. or Marvel universe. and , maybe, for an action film, I prefer Batman more than Ironman who, I admitt, was unknow for me before this film. the only motif to see the film was Robert Downey jr. and it is a serious motif. because, for an outsider, ""Ironman"" is real...cool. for humour, performances, meet between Jeff Bridges and Robert Downey, story, references to many episodes from superheroes adventures and, sure, but less, for CGI effects. it is part of a trend proposing its voice. with succes. and that defines it. so, enjoy it !', '""Iron Man"" is an American superhero film from 8 years ago and it was the great revival of Robert Downey Jr.\'s career. Once a lauded young television actor and Oscar nominee for ""Chaplin"", he quickly faced the dark side of show business, but in 2008 he pursued his great comeback. And he should not only lead the ""Iron Man"" franchise, but quickly afterward also become the new ""Sherlock Holmes"" and certainly a superior one to Benedict Cumberbatch. But lets get back to this film we have here. It received great audience numbers and critics reviews and was one of the main reasons why superhero films are so much en vogue again. But it\'s not all Downey Jr.\'s achievement. Jeff Bridges created a nice main antagonist shortly before his Oscar win and then there is of course Jon Favreau\'s (an actor himself, also appears in here) strong direction and a truly excellent script for such a genre film.Its biggest strength is probably how well-structured it all is. The first third is about the hostage situation, the second is about Stark\'s change in character and the consequences and the final third of the film is what you may call the boss fight. I generally don\'t mind if we find out about the main antagonist right away, but it was also nicely done with the path they chose here. Then again, Marvel fans certainly knew right away. It was a very smart decision. The terrorists were the main villains for at least half the film until we found out who was in charge of them really and there is one scene way into the second half during which we see they are not in control at all. It\'s also a decent development that will not offend people that follow the religion of Islam, who may have seen this film as being too much against their faith otherwise.The film runs for slightly over 2 hours with credits and that\'s perfectly fine. No need to stretch it to 150 minutes and the way it is it also never drags and is an enjoyable watch from start to finish. The only somewhat negative association I had came with Gwyneth Paltrow who was occasionally cringeworthy in her few scenes. Then again, I do not see much talent in her anyway. And one notion about the Transformers-like fight at the end. I would have preferred that the way he could have won would have been with that reference to freezing armor, which was very nice and certainly would have been my preferred choice over a collaboration battle with Paltrow\'s character. It also would have emphasized again what they were telling us for the entire film. Stark may have been a bon vivant, but he is also a lone wolf. Apart from that, I was happy that the film focused a lot more on story than on special effects and visuals. I wish more superhero films would go that route.As a whole, needless to say now that I enjoyed the watch and will certainly rewatch the second film and watch the third at some point. And I am not even speaking about the other Avengers film that I will certainly watch at some point in the future too. Thanks to Mr. Samuel L. Jackson for leading us towards them in the post-credit sequence. As for ""Iron Man"", this was a pretty good effort I must say. Delivered in basically all areas convincingly and I urge you to check this one out. On a final note, I liked that they cast fairly unknown actors for major supporting parts here such as Yinsen and Raza, also something that other (superhero) film makers should go for in the future.', 'The playboy wolf and genius Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is the successful CIO of the Stark Industries, a weapon company founded by his father. His second in command is Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges), who worked with his father, and his loyal and professional secretary is Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), who has a crush on Tony. While in Afghnistan to demonstrate the ultimate Jericho missile developed by his company, his military convoy is attacked and Tony is seriously wounded on his chest and kidnapped by a group of rebels that wants him to assemble a missile for their use. Tony stays with his abductors for three months and develops a powerful metallic armor to escape from the cave where he is arrested. He decides to stop manufacturing weapons in his company under the protest of Obadiah, and dedicates his time to improve the armor, manufacturing it with gold and titanium and installing a propulsion system to fly. However, Pepper discovers that Tony was betrayed by Obadiah, who is using Tony\'s data to build prototype armor for him, transforming it in the ultimate weapon.""Iron Man"" is an entertaining adventure, with great special effects and good and funny story, and nothing else. However, the User Rating of Top 250: #192 is absolutely overrated and offensive to the great movies of the cinema history. The IMDb formula may indicate the movies with massive votes and high rating but never the greatest movies of the cinema industry. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Homem de Ferro"" (""Iron Man"")', 'Growing up, Tony Stark was always good with machines \x96 very good. This pleased his father, who was equally as skilled and had built his internationally successful weapons company up from the ground with the sole aim of arming his country to help them win the wars they face. When his father died when he was still young, the company went into the safe hands of friend and partner Obadiah Stane but, at 21, Stark came back onto the scene as head of the company and, it must be said, something of a playboy with a deserved reputation for loving woman and having a general cavalier attitude to life. However a weapons demonstration in the Middle East changes that when he is captured by terrorists and made to build them weapons. He escapes by building himself a mechanical suit and blasting his way out, but the experience has changed him and on his return to the US announces that the firm is dropping out of arms manufacture \x96 an announcement that dismays Stane and the board, but not as much as his other plans would.Iron Man was more or less the first big film of the summer and, unlike the blockbuster season of 2007 it was a good start because Iron Man pretty much did everything that a Blockbuster should. It is big noisy fun, with good action sequences, comedy and effects and it is yet another superhero movie \x96 which is the only thing about it that gave me cause for concern. The thing is, as good as some of them are, we also have lame ones where the focus is on the effects and nothing else. Iron Man is not the new Batman films but nor is it anywhere near the level of Fantastic Four, if anything it is like what one would want Fantastic Four to be like. I say this meaning that Iron Man has a solid plot (although the ""developmental"" film is generally the ""easiest"" one to get right), fun characters and a good sense of humour thanks to the character of Stark \x96 I mean, I like Batman\'s tortured psyche as a subject but Stark would be a lot more fun to hang out with.Towards the end, the plot suddenly moves past the developmental plot line and gets to the ""conclusion"". It is noisy and not as exciting as I would have liked but it is good enough to satisfy those who want to see their money up on the screen. For me the rest of the film was stronger as it focused on Stark, who is nailed by a perfectly cast Downey Jr. His acerbic sense of humour and real lifestyle of excess helps the film and he is an enjoyable centre piece who remains a presence even when he is just a CGI effect on screen. Paltrow looks good and fills the undemanding role well despite me personally not liking her that much. Bridges was a solid presence for the most part, even if not that much is made of him, while Howard is a good name to allow the series to continue with stars on board. I didn\'t think that Favreau would be up to the task since this is really his first big budget action film but, while not anything special, he did a good job and perhaps it helped with the humour to have him on board but we shall see if he returns with Iron Man 2 (which I\'m assuming is a given as a project).So OK we have the Batmans and other good films this summer but for simple popcorn enjoyment, Iron Man holds its own. Don\'t look for a lot of soul searching (Stark\'s change of heart is more a plot device than a subject for exploration) but if you would solid action, some good laughs and a generally enjoyable product then this will fill that need till the next one comes along.', 'I have to state, that I\'m not an avid comic(graphic novel) book reader, so I can\'t point out any differences between the written (or drawn) world and the real (filmed) world. But I know that this movie was a lot of fun and it seems to owe many things to Batman Begins ... beginning with an ensemble cast!But the main actor here is of course Robert Downey Jr. If you have followed his career & private life (some ups, unfortunately many ""downs"" too, no pun intended), you have to be real happy seeing him getting recognized for his talent and finally beginning to explore his (acting) abilities and being confident enough to play major roles. This is apparent through the screen/his acting. He is very comfortable (not only because of the ""support"" cast, that ... supports him, Terence Howard, Gwyneth P. and Jeff B.) and this helps elevate the movie! It is fun & light, but with an honest message/warning (just like Mr. Downey himself)', 'So here I am in my late fifties with enough of a connection to my comic book collecting past to be intrigued by modern day super hero films. Now I was never a Marvel Comics geek, my favorite characters were the mainstays of the DC Comics universe, like Superman, Batman, Green Lantern, et al. But if you were a fan, you couldn\'t help but know about the alternative universe that contained Spider-Man, The Incredible Hulk, The X-Men and Iron Man, which brings us to the subject at hand. I thought that the movie did a credible job of spanning the forty year comic book history of Iron Man about as well as could be expected in a distilled down two hour movie. Particularly effective was the way we see how the origin costume in the picture pays tribute to the early Iron Man years, while the modern day red and gold armor conveys the advance of science and technology into the twenty first century. Comic book purists will most likely have serious issues with the picture, but I\'ve been able to get over the whole faithfulness to continuity issue some time ago. What I\'m looking for in a flick like ""Iron Man"" is an opportunity to be entertained for a couple of hours, and there\'s enough here to have some fun and be just that - entertained.The one thing I AM looking for in the Marvel universe pictures is the ubiquitous cameo appearance of Stan Lee, creator of many of the comic book icons we recognize today. He\'s incorrectly credited in the cast listing as I write this, as he\'s listed appearing as himself. What you need to do is pay attention to that party scene in the casino when Tony Stark says hi to \'Hef\'. That was just the coolest way to get Stan into the picture, and I give him a lot of credit for not taking himself too seriously as he truly is one of the gods of comic book history.As for the picture, it\'s easy enough to bash it for it\'s adherence to current world events and the milieu of extremist terrorism. But is that any worse than reliving the events of the early 1960\'s and placing the character in the middle of the Bay of Pigs or the Cuban Missile Crisis? The present day Iron Man can be a product of his time and still be effective as a symbol of patriotism and honor, even while the rest of the country is immersed in presidential primaries and partisan politics.You have to give credit to the selection of Robert Downey Jr. for the Iron Man role. Perhaps his own bouts with substance abuse uniquely prepared him for an outstanding performance as the conflicted title character. However the character I was intrigued with the most was Jeff Bridges\' Obadiah Stane, I just couldn\'t get over his appearance as Tony Stark\'s operations chief. The role was played with just the right amount of reserve and just below the surface malice; I thought he did an excellent job. Gwyneth Paltrow had pretty much a thankless job as Stark\'s personal assistant and secret admirer and it didn\'t seem to me that her performance was all that stand out.As an aside, the one thing I feel I do have to comment on is a personal gripe of mine relative to the IMDb ranking system. As I write this, ""Iron Man"" sits at number #130 of the all time best films as ranked by current users. It seems to me that the way fans line up behind a picture even before it\'s released, there ought to be a moratorium of say, two or three years before a new release could be eligible for Top 250 ranking. When you consider the truly great films of all time like ""Casablanca"" or ""Citizen Kane"", it\'s hard for me to reconcile a popcorn flick like this one to be considered in the same breath. I feel the same way (as to a voting moratorium) about stunning pictures like ""No Country For Old Men"" and ""There Will Be Blood"". If a picture has the legs to stand up as an all time great, it will be remembered a couple years after it\'s original release. Remember all the fanboy hype about ""Serenity""? Does anyone even care about that picture today? See what I mean?', 'Over the years, I had heard of many superheros: Superman, Spider-Man, the Hulk, the X Men. However, until Jon Favreau\'s ""Iron Man"" came to theaters, I had never heard of Iron Man! That made the movie even more of a treat. I liked how they incorporated world events into the story: in this case, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) makes weapons for the army but has misgivings after his experience in Afghanistan. I\'ll admit that I\'m not really any fan of superhero stories. But I do think that they did a good job with this movie, so I recommend it.Also starring Terrence Howard, Jeff Bridges, Gwyneth Paltrow, Sayed Badreya, and of course Stan Lee in a brief appearance.', ""I have never been terribly fond of Iron Man. As a comic reader for twenty years, I knew him and have come across him from time to time, but never really found his story that intriguing. He is, basically, Marvel's answer to Batman. That being said, this movie was excellent.I think they fit in all the necessary story parts, and they were executed wonderfully. Robert Downey Jr has finally made the comeback he deserves, and is bigger than ever. I am unclear about the Pepper Potts situation, but think it is being handled well in this film -- she is obviously conflicted, both in love with her boss but also wary of his womanizing. That makes sense. And the way they made his transformation from jerk to somewhat respected is a nice move.Purists might be upset that his origins were moved from Vietnam to Afghanistan, but that would just be protesting nonsense. In order for Stark to fit the timeline of the Avengers story (in the films), he needs to be modern, and I think this was handled excellently."", 'Spider-Man was great, the first Hulk wasn\'t, and the Fantastic Four did okay, and then came this film with Marvel creating their own film studio to complete their piece, from director Jon Favreau (Elf). Basically Tony Stark (National Movie Award nominated Robert Downey Jr.) is the successful and rich head of Stark Industries, who manufacture weapons all over the world, and his life is changed when he is badly wounded in the chest. Tony is saved by a special metal based plate in his chest that keeps the shrapnel from reaching his heart, but he is also forced to create a new weapon by his Middle Eastern captors. In the time he has to build this weapon, he instead creates a metal armoured suit to make his escape and attack all in his way, and he manages it. When Tony returns to the US, he announces that from his experiences, he realises his company is not doing good making weapons, and he starts making modifications to his armour suit design. While Tony changes the design, manufacturing it with gold and titanium, and adding a jet-propulsion system to fly, his second in charge Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) is still selling weapons to the Middle East. While in Afganistan, Stane comes face to face with Tony\'s original metal suit, and decides that it the new unknown ""Iron Man"" in the city, to go up against him. In the end, after defeating Stane, and against the advice of his crush-driven personal secretary Virginia \'Pepper\' Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), Tony announces to America and the world that he is Iron Man. Also starring Terrence Howard as Rhodey, Leslie Bibb as Christine Everhart, Shaun Toub as Yinsen, Faran Tahir as Raza, Clark Gregg as Agent Coulson, Bill Smitrovich as General Gabriel, Paul Bettany as Jarvis and look out for Stan Lee as the man in the smoking jacket. Downey Jr. has been away as a leading star for a while, and this is a fantastic return for him, and he has great support from a reliable Paltrow, and a mean performance from Bridges. There is good action and adventure, there are great special effects coupled with cool gadgets, and a quite engaging story to carry you along, it is a great fantasy superhero movie. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Sound Editing and Best Visual Effects, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated the National Movie Award for Best Superhero. Very good!', ""At first glance Tony Stark isn't the sort of person you'd expect to become a superhero; he is a genius who has made his fortune inventing and selling state of the art weapons systems. At least he was until he is captured by insurgents in Afghanistan and learns that it isn't only the good guys who use his products. Once they have him the insurgents instruct him to make them a version of his latest weapon; instead he makes an armoured suit that renders him bullet proof and even enables him to fly. Using the suit he manages to escape and when he gets back to the United States he renounces the arms trade much to the consternation of this erstwhile partner. Tony now devotes his time to making a new improved version of the suit which he uses to protect the people that where being oppressed by his company's weapons. He isn't the only person with an armoured suit though; his partner Obadiah Stane is building one too and when it is completed he will attempt to destroy Tony.I found the earlier parts of this film to be the best; Robert Downey Jr. did a good job as Tony Stark making his damascene conversion from arms dealer to protector of the innocent believable at the end the story was just about two giant robots\x85 I mean men in power suits fighting; although I'm sure that is the scene younger members of the audience will enjoy most. Jeff Bridges also put in a good performance as bad guy Obadiah and Gwyneth Paltrow was fine as Tony's PA Pepper Potts. I was rather pleased that they managed to avoid the cliché of Tony and Pepper becoming a couple even if it was hinted that they might become one in the future. Unlike a lot of super heroes Tony Stark has no problem with killing his enemies and the weapons he uses may mean some parents might not thing this film is suitable for younger children."", 'Simply put, this was a very entertaining movie.Despite the movie running a little long for an intense, action movie, overall it was still very interesting and fun to watch because the pacing was so good. Neither the action segments nor the lulls, the robot scenes or the soldier scenes nor the very low-key romance is overdone. It\'s all in good proportion. It\'s not an innocent based-on-a-comic character film but, frankly, what movie is nowadays? There\'s always some profanity and sexual innuendos that don\'t belong in a ""kids"" movie made today. Thankfully, that kind of stuff was a lot lower in content than the recent ""Transformers"" film I viewed.The scenes with ""Iron Man"" a.k.a. ""Tony Stark"" (Robert Downey Jr.) in his suit and demonstrating his spectacular skills were - no surprise - the most fun to watch. (If you have a chance, catch this on Blu-Ray as the transfer is terrific). At the end of the film we get another robot, piloted by the corporate bad guy ""Obadiah Stane"" (Jeff Bridges) and that huge Iron Man-clone is fun to see, too.Some complain the film is not really all that ""smart"" and it\'s a bit too predictable, but it\'s fun ride of escapism that offers a good two hours of diversion thanks to very good special-effects and mostly-likable characters. Speaking of characters, it wasn\'t easy to recognize Bridges with a bald head and full beard but once I heard his distinctive voice, I knew who it was. Gywneth Paltrow played a sweet role as Stark\'s loyal secretary, ""Pepper Potts."" (Nice name!!). The Afghanistan villain was credible. Actually, I liked him better than the obnoxious Liberal news reporter, who was annoying.The ""moral"" of the story the screenwriters preach is that military might as a deterrent to fighting terrorists can easily backfire as companies which manufacture arms for the U.S. could also be acquired by bad guys (because of greedy and corrupt U.S. businessmen). This is naive Liberal propaganda, the kind I would expect out of the movie industry, whether in Hollywood or Europe. Sadly, there will never be a shortage of bullies and evil people, who will then crush an unarmed foe as the people in this film attempt to do. It\'s also implausible any company like the one shown in this movie could so easily travel to a hot spot like Afghanistan and deal with terrorists. It\'s unrealistic, but that\'s today\'s movies for you. Also, despite the nonviolent message in the story, the good guy sure wipes out his share of people with a variety of weapons! For someone preaching peace, he sure didn\'t hesitate in killing opponents.Iron Man\'s metal suit is definitely very cool, equipped with about anything you\'d need to fight an army of terrorists, or anyone else. The suit - and his super pacemaker - turn him into a Superman-type guy in that he can fly pretty high and pretty high. The latter part - how high he could fly - makes a nice conclusion, by the way, regarding the good guy\'s battle against the ""bad Iron Man.""', ""In 1978, I saw Christopher Reeve as Superman and believed a man could fly (gimme a break... I was only 10); 1989, and The Rocketeer made me want to soar across the heavens (and, being 21, also get off with Jennifer Connelly). Now, at the age of 44, Iron Man Iron Man has re-ignited my dream of tearing through the sky at unimaginable speeds (while blowing the crap out of anyone who gets in my way!).A super-slick, witty, thrill-a-minute, action-packed comic-book adventure laden with top-notch effects and blessed with an excellent cast, Iron Man is easily the best Marvel adaptation that I have seen to date (although, admittedly, I've fallen a long way behind when it comes this particular genre).Jon Favreau's direction is so good, it's hard to believe that the same guy who went on to give us Cowboys & Aliens; Robert Downey Jr. is superb in the role of Tony Stark, the weapons manufacturer who has a change of heart (quite literally) and decides to dedicate his genius to helping mankind by creating a hi-tech suit with which he battle the bad guys; likewise, Jeff Bridges is terrific as his nemesis, evil corporation man Obadiah, who wants to continue dealing in death with the enemy; and Gwyneth Paltrow is absolutely lovely as plucky woman in peril Pepper Potts (she's no Jennifer Connelly, though... give me the brunette over the blonde any day of the week!).8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb."", 'A really, really good comic book action movie. The snappy dialog, good acting, and good directing make all the difference.I\'ve always enjoyed Robert Downey Jr., even in his TV roles, and here he carries the movie as Tony Stark, boy genius and inventor who after his father\'s death gains control of the biggest corporation making missiles and other machines of war. Tony continues what his father had built, and takes it a few steps further with his own inventions.Another actor I always like is Terrence Howard, and here he is long time friend of Tony\'s, and a military officer, Rhodey.Tony\'s right hand man in his company is Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane. He had run the company while Tony was still growing up and seems to want to continue his expanded role.Good as Tony\'s trusty personal assistant is Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts. She is not only a loyal employee but also a sort of ""pal"" to Tony, yet it seems that she wishes there were more between them.The story centers on an incident where Tony had travels to a war zone to demonstrate to the US military their newest weapon. But there is a motorcade attack and Tony gets imprisoned, with the demand that he develop the new weapon for them. Instead he invents something new, a rather crude iron man suit that he eventually uses to break free. But the experience changes him, as he sees that even the enemy have weapons that his company makes. His big decision when back home is to quit making weapons and instead concentrate on helping humanity.SPOILERS: When back home Tony works hard to perfect a sleek new Iron Man suit, one that can fly anywhere and even at supersonic speeds, and that has exotic weapon and navigational capabilities. In the process he has Pepper track down through company records how enemies were getting weapons. It turns out to be Obadiah, who is trying to get Tony killed so that he can run the corporation and enrich himself further with illegal weapons sales. The climax comes when Obadiah gets into a larger, more powerful iron man suit, and he and Tony battle. With Pepper\'s help he overcomes Obadiah, and in a conference reveals that he, Tony, is indeed the Iron Man.', 'Iron Man is about as close to perfect popcorn entertainment as we can expect in this beginning of the summer season. But at the same time perfect in a certain sensibility of entertainment for its audience. One should know what Tony Stark\'s as a character not exactly the usual \'with great power come great response-yada-yada-yada\' thing. He has a more jaded attitude, slightly more cynical than your typical man-of-steel (wait, sorry, iron, or alloy as it is). I\'m almost reminded a little of Bill Murray from Ghostbusters, only with the catch of him being like Bruce Wayne without the grieving dead parents aspect.He has lots of money, lots of technical know-how as a wonder-kid/multi-millionaire, and he drinks and gambles and sleeps with whomever he wants. We as the audience don\'t identify with him as average Joe- some of us would want to be him for all the hedonistic perks available. And, when the time comes, he can whip up a technological breakthrough under the most dire of circumstances (i.e. under pressure of death to make a weapon for terrorists and instead making his quintessential suit).But at the same time, when Tony Stark becomes Iron Man, he does have a level of conscience from the start, realizing that the company that is under his name (if not one he entirely runs) has been manufacturing big-time weapons of mass mayhem (dont want to put destruction in there, though it\'s pretty much that), and wants to not want this any longer. Instead, basically, he takes matters into his own hands as some fantastical figure; instead of some army to take out insurgent terrorists in Afghanistan, he\'ll come and wipe em out in a jiffy. In this sense it\'s pure escapism, but also hitting on current issues (in the comic books it was similar terrain with him practically taking out Vietcong every which way). True, it might be much to imagine, but in the realm of a comic book movie, where we\'re already on the train of massive entertainment and being along for the ride of this character who can do what he does because he\'s that damn good.It\'s a thrill-ride, and it\'s very funny for much of the running time. And not unintentionally so like in, for example, Ghost Rider. It\'s genuinely hysterical to see certain things that make sense for Stark but are still wildly over the top in delicious ways (i.e. the strippers on the plane, yeah you read that right), or in just little things with how Robert Downey Jr. plays it. And make no mistake, this is pretty much a textbook example of perfect casting for a tricky character like this to cast. You want the charisma and appeal of a leading man, but can he also have something to him that speaks of the moral ambivalence and seedier bits to the character? You can\'t do it with a George Clooney, but with Downey Jr. it\'s a match made in not-guilty-pleasure heaven. He\'s able to bring the audience for the ride as a strong hero, but also hint at the fact that he\'s playing this character for what he is, and not cheating or skipping around the edges. Without him, it wouldn\'t work anywhere near as well.But to give director Favreau some more credit where it\'s due, also should be noted the near coup of casting Jeff Bridges as the villain - and as a character who is, basically, the ""anti-dude"" as it were - a dastardly figure who runs all of the shady dealings of Stark Industries and reveals his hand at wanting total domination of Stark\'s technology for his own means. His is a performance to relish among the great comic-book villain turns. But also noteworthy are supporting players: Gwyneth Paltrow, where\'d she come from for this part that works this well? Terence Howard as well, and a couple of other supporting parts, they all seem to click just as well.Which brings me to the director, who should get credit where it\'s certainly due; coming from work as an actor/writer, going up through Made, Elf, and the recent bomb Zathura, it\'s a remarkable achievement to pull this kind of work off. While it goes without saying the script is already set for him to go, he doesn\'t tinker with it or his style to make it any more aggressively stylish than it needs to be. His is slick, efficient film-making, and even with witty moments to match up the bigger audience laughs (watch how he keeps the camera still through the POV of the lens Stark has up filming his botched \'test\' in his rockets). For all the praise that Downey (very rightfully) will get for his work here, Favreau\'s is probably just as noteworthy in mixing rousing thrills and blockbuster entertainment and action while shamelessly delivering on the cynical side of the story. Just the final line, and how its delivered and in the context, is worth the price of admission.Oh, and by the way, stay through the end credits. If you\'re geeky about anything Iron Man (or awesome actors in eye-patches), you\'ll leave with a huge grin from ear to ear.', 'While I have long been a fan of various superhero movies, I admit I only have a passing interest in the ""Iron Man"" comic books since I only read some \'80s issues my brother owned when Tony Stark was suffering from alcoholism and a black associate had taken the mantle. That said, this was a pretty cool action movie directed by Jon Favreau with some subtle humor shoehorned in courtesy of Robert Downey, Jr. as Stark and Gwyneth Paltrow as his associate Pepper Potts. What a nicely romantic team they play here! While there\'s also Terrence Howard and Jeff Bridges to fill up the capable supporting cast, I must mention Clark Gregg as a SHIELD agent who has his own amusing moments in his brief scenes with Ms. Paltrow. He\'s a regular on ""The New Adventures of Old Christine"". There\'s great drama in Afganistan and plenty of kick-butt action in whatever city this movie takes place in that I was wholly enthralled the whole way through. With a sequel already being planned, I wholly look forward to the next adventures of Iron Man! P.S. Check out Stan Lee being mistaken for Hugh Hefner here.', ""Action-pact thriller provides a field day for Robert Downey, Jr. He plays a wealthy guy, who after being imprisoned by terrorists in Afghanistan, swears off the making of military hardware, but at the same time creates Iron Man, a robot-like specimen that will destroy all evil in its path.As his assistant and lover, Gwyneth Paltrow has found a role that is totally beneath that of a former Oscar winner.Jeff Bridges is excellent as his adviser. It doesn't take much to realize that Bridges has his own agenda in this film and that he is up to absolutely no good whatsoever.The kids will love the special affects here, especially the fight between the two robots (Downey and Bridges) on that bridge near the film's end."", 'This film is about a wealthy weapon developer making a superhero suit, and uses it to fight against evil forces.After watching ""Iron Man"" I felt so disappointed. I think it is not as good as the ratings suggest. The pacing is incredibly slow for a fantasy action hero movie. It\'s well over 30 minutes and Stark is still developing the suit! The plot is not very engaging either, it is not exciting enough. The characters are poorly developed too. I do not find myself care for any of the characters, except maybe Stark. Poor Gwyneth Paltrow, she is such a supporting character in here, and her role could be played by anyone. Action scenes are sparse and short, and not exciting at all. The subplot about battles in Afghanistan feels more like an oppositional political propaganda, rather than the story actually needs. ""Iron Man"" needs a script rewrite and a much tighter editing to make it more thrilling.', ""Iron Man is based on the fictional Marvel Comics character Iron Man.

Stark realizes that many of his weapons are being used to kill Americans in combat. He holds a press conference expounding his manufacturing empire will quit the production of weapons. He puts a lot of effort in perfecting his armored suit to turn himself into the highly technological hero Iron Man. Gwyneth Paltrow plays his faithful personal assistant Pepper Potts.

He is joking with some members of a convoy who seem to be genuinely amused by his persona and his flamboyant public image. Suddenly, the convoy is ambushed by unseen gunmen. The soldiers fight to defend themselves but are quickly killed. Tony flees the Humvee, taking refuge behind a large rock. Moments later, a missile lands nearby and explodes, but not before Tony sees the Stark Industries logo painted on it. A small amount of shrapnel penetrates his body armor and he is thrown backwards, losing consciousness.Las Vegas, 36 hours earlierTony Stark is about to receive the Apogee Award in Las Vegas. A presentation documents Tony\'s life story: born the son of legendary weapons developer Howard Stark, Tony is a child prodigy who built his first circuit board when he was four years old, his first V8 engine when he was six, and graduated summa cum laude from MIT when he was 17. His parents were killed in a car accident in 1991, and when he was 21, he became CEO of Stark Industries, where he is to this day. Colonel James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes (Terrence Howard) prepares to present Tony the award, but Tony is not in attendance. Tony\'s right-hand man (and his father\'s former partner) Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) accepts the award in Tony\'s stead. Rhodey later finds Tony partying in a casino. On his way out, a reporter named Christine Everhart (Leslie Bibb) approaches Stark with some questions regarding the ethics of his weapons business. Stark deflects her questions with some swift quips and the two end up spending the night together at Tony\'s oceanfront house in Malibu.The next morning, Christine is awakened by a voice on a computer monitor. It\'s JARVIS (voice: Paul Bettany), the artificially intelligent program responsible for running Tony\'s house and his research lab. As Christine leaves the house, she\'s greeted by Tony\'s human assistant, Virginia ""Pepper"" Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow). Pepper helps Tony catch up on some business before Tony heads out to the airport where his plane awaits. In flight, Tony talks with Rhodey. Rhodey is unhappy about Tony\'s lax attitude, and Tony tries to get his old friend to relax. Before long they are drunk and leering at the flight attendants.Tony arrives at a military outpost in Afghanistan to demonstrate his company\'s latest project: the Jericho, an advanced super-missile system. After the demonstration, Tony gets a phone call from Obadiah and they are both pleased that the demonstration went well. Refusing to ride with Rhodey, Tony takes off in another Humvee where the ambush from the opening of the story takes place.Much later, Tony regains consciousness in a cave. On his chest is a strange device, crudely connected to a car battery. Another captive, Dr. Ho Yinsen (Shaun Toub), explains that he operated on Tony but was unable to remove all of the shrapnel. Yinsen created a device -- essentially an electromagnet -- that will keep the remaining fragments from shifting and causing further damage to his heart. The terrorists who captured Tony and Yinsen enter the room. Yinsen translates; they want Tony to build them a Jericho missile. Tony refuses and they torture him by dunking his head in water.Hours later, the terrorists, members of a group called the the Ten Rings, show off a huge stockpile of weapons -- all made by Stark Industries. Tony appears to give in and starts building the missile, but he has other plans. With Yinsen\'s steady doctor\'s hands, and using palladium collected from his weapons, Tony constructs a tiny version of an arc reactor, streamlined from a much bigger design used at his company\'s headquarters. The power output is enough to run Stark\'s heart for ""fifty lifetimes... or something much bigger for about 15 minutes."" It will also be enough to keep the shrapnel in Tony\'s heart from shifting any further and killing him. Yinsen tells Tony a little about himself; he lived in an Afghani village called Gulmira that was attacked by the Ten Rings. He doesn\'t know if his family is still alive. He also reveals that he\'d met Tony years before at a conference but Tony was so drunk that night he probably doesn\'t remember him.Tony is spurred and seems to have a change of heart. He begins to draw up plans for a weapon system, an armored suit powered by the arc reactor that he will wear and use to defeat the terrorists. Midway through construction, the head of the Ten Rings, Raza (Faran Tahir), arrives and threatens to torture Yinsen, angry because he thinks Stark is not working on the Jericho as they wanted. Tony bargains for Yinsen\'s life, saying he makes a good assistant. Raza gives them one more day to finish.Working furiously overnight, Tony completes his project. Yinsen straps Tony into the completed armored suit, telling him the way out of the cave. They set off a bomb inside the cell door as a distraction for the guards as Tony powers up his suit. Yinsen realizes that they will not have enough time. Over Tony\'s protests, he grabs a gun and runs off to distract the surviving guards.Tony, his suit now fully powered, muscles his way through the cave. The guards try to stop him but his suit easily deflects their weapon fire and he beats them off or kills them. He also fires one of the suit\'s missiles at Raza himself, who is flung out of sight by the blast. Halfway out of the cavern, Stark finds Yinsen, mortally wounded. Yinsen reveals that this was his plan, sacrificing himself so Tony could escape -- Yinsen\'s family is already dead and he will now see them again in the afterlife. Tony tearfully thanks Yinsen for saving him. Yinsen\'s last words to Stark are not to waste his second chance at life.Tony turns his suit on the remaining terrorists, igniting flame-throwers and firing missiles. He destroys their stockpile of weapons, but some of their larger-caliber weaponry begins to damage his suit. He uses a rudimentary jet-pack to launch himself out of the valley. Not long after firing, his jet-pack fails and he survives a crash in the desert. Stark leaves the suit behind and hikes through the desert until a couple of US helicopters fly overhead. A group of soldiers, led by Rhodey, come across Tony. Rhodey is overjoyed to find that his friend is alive.Tony is quickly flown back to the United States. Upon his arrival at Edwards Air Force Base, Pepper wants Tony to receive medical treatment, but Tony says that there are only two things he wants: an American cheeseburger and a company press conference. So Tony appears before a group of reporters and, clearly humbled and no longer the arrogant CEO he was before his capture, announces that he intends to shut down Stark Industries\' weapons manufacturing division immediately. At the same time, Pepper is approached by Agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) the from Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement & Logistic Division. They want to talk to Tony about his capture. Pepper schedules an appointment for them.That evening, Obadiah confronts Tony about his actions, furious. Obadiah knows that the stock value for their company (and, by extension, their financial status) is going to take a serious drop because of this announcement. Tony wants Stark Industries to move forward with arc reactor technology, but Obadiah thinks that the arc reactor is nothing but a publicity stunt. Through the conversation, Tony ends up revealing his Mark I chestpiece to Obadiah but refuses to allow the device to be studied for production. Stane convinces Tony to lie low for a while so the company can sort things out.Pepper watches Jim Cramer deliver a scathing news segment on Mad Money on the declining value of Stark Industries when Tony asks for her help. He\'s created an upgraded and much more powerful mini arc reactor, the Mark II chestpiece, but can\'t install it into his chest without someone to help -- his assisting robot, Dummy, tried to insert the arc reactor but failed and Pepper\'s hands are small enough to fit inside the chamber in Tony\'s chest. Pepper accidentally yanks out the cords for the old reactor too soon, putting Tony on the verge of cardiac arrest. They manage to complete the process in time. Tony tells Pepper to destroy the old model since he\'s not a sentimental person.Tony visits Rhodes and asks for help with a new private project. Rhodey does not agree with Tony\'s approach; he thinks Tony is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder because of his capture and needs time to recover.Tony turns to his other best friend -- JARVIS -- for help. Tony\'s plan is revealed to be an upgrade to his armored suit (referred to as Mark II; the suit from the terrorist cave was Mark I). Tony, studying a 3D CGI-mapped image of the Mark I, discards many of the components, streamlining the design. Meanwhile, Raza, having survived his battle with Stark and severely scarred by the rocket attack in the cave, searches the desert, gathering all fragments of the Mark I suit that Tony left behind.Tony decides that the first thing he has to do is to perfect the armor\'s flight system. Since the leg-mounted jets proved too unstable, he creates repulsors for the feet and palm-mounted stabilizers for balance. Pepper comes in when he is testing the stabilizers and they find that it also creates a powerful repulsion beam that could also be used as a weapon. In his first test, the repulsor blows him backward. Pepper leaves a paper-wrapped box on Tony\'s desk as a gift.Obadiah visits Tony and reveals that the board of directors has filed an injunction to gain control of Stark Industries. Tony isn\'t worried; he still maintains controlling interest in Stark Industries.After several failed and painful attempts, Tony perfects his flight system, and is delighted at the prospect of flying.The Mark II armored suit is soon finished. It looks like a heavily-streamlined version of Tony\'s Mark I armor. Tony connects with JARVIS to monitor the progress in the suit. Against JARVIS\'s advice, Tony takes it out for a test flight, and he is thrilled by the suit\'s functionality. Tony pushes the limit for high-atmosphere flying, but at such great heights the freezing air causes the suit to become coated with ice and his power supply shuts down. Tony is barely able to reactivate his thrusters in time to avoid crashing into the ground. Stark returns home, but the armor is so heavy that it smashes through three floors of the house and he crushes one of his prized sports cars. As Tony recovers from his crash landing, he opens the box that Pepper left behind earlier; inside is the Mark I arc reactor, encased as a trophy with the message, ""Proof That Tony Stark Has a Heart.""Tony analyzes more data and decides to rebuild the suit using gold titanium from an old project to solve the icing and weight problems. He instructs JARVIS to add some hot-rod red trim to the next suit, codenamed Mark III, then leaves to attend his annual benefit dinner while the new suit is being assembled and painted.At the charity event, Tony meets with Agent Coulson, who still wants to learn about Tony\'s incident. Tony leaves to dance with Pepper and they share a moment together in the moonlight.Christine, the reporter Tony slept with prior to leaving for Afghanistan, angrily confronts him, showing him photographs of his weapons being used by a terrorist group the previous day in the remote Afghan town of Gulmira, Yinsen\'s home village. Tony confronts Obadiah on the matter, and Obadiah reveals that he is the one who filed the injunction against Tony. Obadiah calls himself an ""iron monger,"" and has no qualms about selling Stark Industries weapons to both sides of the conflict. Tony returns home, furious. While there he watches news reports of the worsening situation in the Gulmira region. He tests modifications to his hand repulsors, turning them into a weapon and blasting out several glass panes. When the new suit is completed it is fitted to his body by an automated robotic system. Stark flies off to Gulmira at hypersonic speed, determined to right his company\'s wrongs.In Gulmira, terrorists are rounding up civilians for capture and execution when Tony shows up. His Mark III armor is more than a match for them. Within seconds, he defeats the first group of terrorists, using his advanced weapons to take out several without any innocent casualties. He leaves the group\'s leader, Raza\'s chief lieutenant, alive and defenseless for the villagers to take their revenge on.While flying to find his weapons, Iron Man is shot down by a tank shell. When he gets up, a second shell barely misses him. He responds by shooting a mini-missile at the tank, destroying it. Using the palm repulsors he designed, he destroys the captured Jericho missiles. After they are demolished, Raza arrives in time to see Tony fly off.CENTCOM at Edwards Air Force Base detects Tony in flight, mistaking him for a rogue drone. Col. Rhodes is asked about the status of any new developments. He contacts Tony, who claims that he knows nothing about what is happening. In the meantime, Tony is confronted by two F-22 Raptors. He tries to outrun the jets but they are too much for him. Tony calls Rhodes and reveals that he is responsible for the ""unidentified craft."" Rhodey is furious about Tony sending in unauthorized equipment, and horrified when Tony explains that the ""equipment"" is actually himself in his new invention. Tony is hit by one fighter jet, sending him flying into the wing of the second jet. The pilot is forced to eject, but his parachute fails to open. Iron Man, still under fire, flies in and deploys the parachute in time to rescue the pilot. Tony convinces Rhodey to pass off what happened with the jets as a ""training exercise.""After Tony arrives back at home, Pepper catches him while the robotic system is removing his suit. The disassembly is not going as well as the assembly and Tony quips that Pepper has seen him in situations that were much worse.Meanwhile, Stane pays a visit to the Ten Rings\' camp, revealing he\'d paid the organization to capture and kill Tony, but they realized who Tony was and had demanded a much higher price when they made their tape. Using a high-powered sonic device that induces temporary paralysis, Stane immobilizes Raza and takes the remnants of the Mark I armor they have gathered. Stane then has his men execute everyone in the camp.Tony tries to talk Pepper into helping him, believing that nothing else matters but saving the people who he put in harm\'s way. Pepper is moved by Tony\'s dedication, and agrees. She goes into Obadiah\'s office with a flash drive programmed to copy files from the computer. As Pepper sifts through stored files, she finds a video from the terrorists proving that Obadiah was responsible for Tony\'s capture. Obadiah comes into the office and sees her at the computer, but Pepper manages to hide what she is really doing. She leaves the office, but as soon as he powers up the computer, Obadiah realizes what she was up to. On the way out, Pepper sees Agent Coulson and tells him he can have his interview immediately so that he accompanies her safely out of the building.Obadiah meets with his team of developers who are working on his own armored suit based on the Mark I. They have rebuilt the components, but they cannot miniaturize Stark\'s arc reactor. Stane is furious but relents when the lead developer tells him he\'s not the genius Tony is. Obadiah realizes that he has one other option.Stane arrives at Tony\'s house and paralyzes him with the sonic weapon. Obadiah yanks out the the Mark II chest piece from Tony\'s chest, taunting him about how it will be the flagship invention in a new era of weaponry. After he leaves, Tony realizes that he has only one hope for survival -- the preserved arc reactor that Pepper gave him as a gift. He staggers down to his workshop and nearly dies while trying to retrieve the reactor, which is handed to him by Dummy. Tony gets the reactor installed just as Rhodey arrives. Rhodey informs him that five agents have gone to arrest Obadiah, but Tony knows that is not nearly enough manpower.Rhodey watches Tony suit up, awestruck at the Iron Man armor. Rhodey asks if there\'s anything Tony needs, Tony asks him to ""keep the skies clear."" As Tony flies away, Rhodey spots the silver-colored prototype suit, the Mark II... then shakes his head and mumbles ""Next time.""Pepper, Coulson and several other agents arrive at Obadiah\'s research facility. They spot the Mark I armor and a storage location where something else was kept. Just then, a gigantic robotic suit comes to life and attacks them -- it\'s Obadiah\'s counterpart suit, code-named the Iron Monger, powered by the chest piece he stole from Tony.While Tony flies towards the research facility, JARVIS warns him that he has only about half power in the suit because the older chest piece wasn\'t designed power the Mark III during sustained flight.Tony arrives just as Obadiah is about to execute Pepper. The two ironclad warriors begin a huge, brawling battle that spills into the streets near Stark Industries while Tony tries to protect any innocent civilians. Tony flies into the upper atmosphere, drawing Obadiah along with him. Obadiah struggles but before long his suit begins to freeze up -- it has the same icing problem that Tony\'s Mark II had. Obadiah begins to fall back to Earth, leaving Tony hovering above. The older arc reactor begins to lose power rapidly and Tony falls back to Earth, landing on top of his factory, running on auxiliary backup power.Back on the ground, Obadiah attacks Tony again. Tony manages to disable the weapons tracking system in Obadiah\'s suit and evades Obadiah long enough to instruct Pepper to overload the building\'s arc reactor, which will generate a shock wave strong enough to disable Obadiah\'s suit. Pepper is hesitant, believing that Tony could also be killed. Tony manages to keep fighting while she builds up power to the reactor. The reactor releases its shock wave, knocking out the Iron Monger suit, which falls into the reactor, killing Stane and destroying the reactor. Stark\'s original mini arc reactor sparks back to life, allowing Tony to survive.Days later, Rhodey holds a press conference about the incident with the two ""robots."" Tony is impressed with the name the newspapers come up with, ""Iron Man,"" and plans to adopt it. Agent Coulson has released cover stories about the death of Obadiah (who will die in a small plane crash while Tony is supposedly elsewhere) and the ""truth"" about Iron Man (who will be referred to as Stark\'s bodyguard). Pepper thanks Coulson but cannot remember the full name of the group he belongs to. Coulson tells them to call it ""S.H.I.E.L.D."" and says that they will be in touch again.Tony goes before the reporters once more, and prepares to comply with the cover story. But, as he begins talking, he throws away his notes and declares ""I am Iron Man."" The press goes into a frenzy.Much later (after the credits), Tony returns home to find a mysterious man in black telling him that as Iron Man, Tony has become part of a larger universe. Tony asks who the man is. He turns around and introduces himself: Nick Fury, director of S.H.I.E.L.D. (Samuel L. Jackson). He\'s come to talk with Tony about an upcoming project known as the ""Avenger Initiative.""']"
28,Marvel Cinematic Universe,The Incredible Hulk,800080,"['Before getting into the film, I should probably point out that I am not the best reviewer for this film--unless, like me, you aren\'t all that familiar with the Hulk. Apart from seeing the pilot of the TV series and riding on the Hulk ride at Universal\'s theme park, The Island\'s of Adventure, I have never seen anything of the green guy--not a single comic book nor the previous movie from 2003. So, for the die-hard Hulkophile, I am certainly not the best person to review the film. In fact, I only have watched super hero films because I have a friend and daughter who push me to give them a try. And, in general, I have enjoyed them...but I am still not a big fan.This film is a sequel (of sorts) and it\'s obvious from the beginning that the film has come after a lot of things have occurred. Bruce Banner is already the Hulk and how that all came to be was explored in the first film...or at least that\'s what I\'ve been told. Oddly, he\'s in Brazil and perhaps he chose this nation because of their spiffy green flag. After a short time, the evil general (William Hurt) and his minions pounce on Banner and try to kidnap him. Not unexpectedly, Banner becomes Hulk and kicks butt. Later, they try the same thing repeatedly, but this time they give Tim Roth (why is an English guy playing a guy in the US Army, by the way--he certainly was no Rambo!) a series of injections to make him a super-soldier--and giving him a chance to defeat the Hulk. The only trouble is--who is going to control this new insanely dangerous nemesis.Despite my being a relative Hulk newbie, I was surprised that my opinion AND the opinion of both my daughters (including the comic book geek one) was pretty much the same. The film had some nice action but not a whole lot else. As for the rest of the film, it was a tad dull and the relationship with the girl really seemed to slow down the film. As a result, the film is a time-passer and not a whole lot more. I sure hope that the folks at Marvel think twice about all their many, many announced upcoming films. If you keep making mediocre super-hero films, you might just end up killing the genre. This is NOT a film of the same quality as ""Iron Man"" or ""The Dark Knight"" (yes, Marvel fans, I know this is a DC franchise--back off, nerd-boys!!!).', ""There may be those who agree with me, and those also who will disagree, but while it is not devoid of flaws I really enjoyed The Incredible Hulk, whereas I was disappointed in 2003's The Hulk, and I'm saying this as someone who loved Ang Lee's other films.If there is one thing that Lee's film succeeds better in, it is the visuals, don't get me wrong they are very stylish here but the ones in the 2003 film were slicker even if The Incredible Hulk is bigger and brasher. This said, the cinematography and editing are great and the locations and lighting look fantastic. The music rouses, the story compels most of the time and the dialogue provokes both in a thoughtful and emotional way.I do think that director Louis Letterier brings a lot of passion into the film, especially with the use of the form of street running called Parkour that he also used in The Transporter. The action sequences are suitably thumping, with efficient choreography and slick editing. The romantic elements are handled in a shrewd manner in alternative to the danger of slowing the film down, and thankfully there is no underdeveloped and convoluted subplot like Lee's film did with Nick Nolte.The first half though in a sense is better than the second. The second half is in no way bad, it's that the first half was very clever and compelling, and although you do identify with the titular character all the time and the finale is earth-shattering the film loses it a bit with the rather clichéd way the villain Blonsky is written and that his motives are not always very clear or as believable as they had potential to be.Casting-wise The Incredible Hulk is excellent. Edward Norton brims with intensity but he is also sympathetic. The Incredible Hulk also succeeds in making a real sense that Banner and the Hulk inhabit the same tortured mind, which made it much more accessible to identify with him, something that Lee's film did not do. William Hurt is appropriately steely as General Ross, Liv Tyler is attractive and the essence of sympathy as Banner's girlfriend and although his character is not as believable Tim Roth does somehow manage to bring some credibility to him.Overall, a very solid film, not perfect but better than the 2003 film by quite some distance. 8/10 Bethany Cox"", ""With The Incredible Hulk Edward Norton can now take his place in the superhero genre besides such contemporaries as Tobey Maguire, Robert Downey, Jr., and Ben Affleck all of whom have played comic book superheroes. It's the in thing to do in Hollywood these days and I have to say the films for the most part make money.When we meet Norton he's living in obscurity in Brazil trying to control his emotions because the experiment that turned him into the green guy have already gone horribly wrong. Norton is scientist Bruce Banner who made the mistake of experimenting on himself. Now if you get him mad it's not a pretty sight both to look at him and to see what he can do.General William Hurt wants him back at any price. His scientist daughter Liv Tyler wants Norton back as well. She's carrying a Statue of Liberty size torch for Norton who when he's in Hulk mode would use that torch as a matchstick.To track down the Hulk, William Hurt has imported a real bad dude from the British Royal Marines in Tim Roth. At some point Hurt decided he'd like a lot of what Norton has and of course the final confrontation is with them. I'm still not sure why we had to import him from the United Kingdom, but the match between them reminded me of Andre the Giant versus Big John Studd back in the glory days of the WWF.Though the cast looked like they were having a good time, I'm not sure The Incredible Hulk gets beyond the comic book stage. TV's famous Doctor Banner, Bill Bixby made a cameo appearance via a clip from another old series of his, The Courtship of Eddie's Father. And when the late Mr. Bixby was in Hulk mode he was Lou Ferrigno who plays a small bit as a security guard who can be bribed with pizza.If this film succeeds I'm sure there will be a sequel, in fact one was kind of set up during this film. Let's see if we get to explore that in the next Incredible Hulk film."", ""This sequel to Ang Lee's 2003 HULK revamp is brought to us by Louis Leterrier, the man responsible for the highly ludicrous (but entertaining) TRANSPORTER 2. THE INCREDIBLE HULK is equally ludicrous but not quite as entertaining, although it does all right for what it is: a simple, shallow, effects-driven adventure aimed at bringing the comic-book storyline into the 21st century. It's certainly a lot more fun than the deadly dull Ang Lee attempt, a hodge podge of plot lines and events seemingly cobbled together from various different movies.The first third involves Edward Norton (replacing Eric Bana as Bruce Banner) hiding out in South America, pursued by government agents in various foot chase scenes reminiscent of THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM (although nowhere near as good). The second third moves back to the USA for some schmaltzy love stuff involving the terribly insipid Liv Tyler, whose presence screams of miscasting. The final third goes for all-out action as two super-beasts pummel each other into submission in the streets of a bustling city.I'm not a great fan of superhero movies but THE INCREDIBLE HULK passes the time readily enough. Edward Norton is a better actor than the film warrants, and he kept me watching despite my reservations. I thought there were too many scenes involving his green alter ego, and the CGI varies between impressive and quite crude. A lengthy bit with the creature and Tyler in a rain-bound cave smacks of KING KONG without any of the pathos.Tim Roth is on hand playing the movie's villain, and he's pretty good, filling his character with unmentioned depravity despite the sometimes lacklustre script. William Hurt is Liv Tyler's dad, and doesn't have much to go with. There are various scenery-smashing interludes involving the big green guy, but they go over the top with the CGI and are quite boring compared to the moments with the human actors. The ending is similar to IRON MAN in that it involves two CGI creations beating each other up, but manages to be a little bit more involved than that catastrophe."", ""The Incredible Hulk (2008) *** (out of 4)Bruce Banner (Edward Norton), not being able to control his powers, goes to Brazil to hide from his past but he ends up back in the states once the government comes after him. With the help of a former flame (Liv Tyler) he tries to learn to control himself but soon he's got an enemy (Tim Roth) gunning for him. THE INCREDIBLE HULK is a pretty good comic adaptation that even those people who aren't fans of comics should enjoy. I think there's a lot of good stuff going on in the picture but I'd say the majority of the credit has to go to Norton for his great performance. When I heard Norton was going to be appearing in a comic movie it took me by surprise because he really doesn't seem to be the type. If rumors are true and he was unhappy with the film it really doesn't show. I thought Norton did a terrific job at showing the characters wide emotions as he fights himself to try and not turn into that towering green guy. I thought the human element Norton was able to bring to the part not only made you feel for the character but it also built up the other relationships in the film. Tyler's character isn't nearly as well-written but I thought she was fine in her part as was William Hurt playing the bad General. Roth is always fun in villain roles and that remains true here. The CGI in the film is rather obvious at times but I thought the filmmakers did a nice job with the Hulk character. The visual look of him was quite good and I thought he blended into the scenes well. The action scenes are all at a high level and especially the final battle."", ""This starts with Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) hiding out in Brazil. When General Ross (William Hurt), finds him and sends Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) to capture him. After a wild chase through the slums of Rio, Banner escapes and returns back home to get his data. Betty Ross (Liv Tyler) finds out and reunites with Banner.This is a good improvement from 2003. Edward Norton can play a wider range and make Banner more charming. Starting it in the Rio slums really ups the ante. It puts a bit of Jason Bourne in Banner. William Hurt is the weak spot. He doesn't have quite enough of the threatening demeanor. Tim Roth is able to pick up some of the slack as the baddie.The CGI fights are still CGI fights. It still feels like a video game. Nothing will ever replace the real feeling that a stunt guy is out there risking life and limb. The last fight with the two does drag on and on. It's still a pretty good entry into the Marvel universe."", 'Dr. Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) is secretly living in the greatest slum of South America, the Favela da Rocinha, and working in a factory of ""cachaça"" in Rio de Janeiro. While seeking the cure with his beloved Dr. Elizabeth Ross (Liv Tyler) and other scientists, he learns how to control his emotions and heart beat and to keep his human form for a long period. When General Thaddeus \'Thunderbolt\' Ross (William Hurt) finds a clue of his location in Brazil, he sends a command leaded by the tough Major Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) to abduct Dr. Banner. However, he transforms in Hulk and escapes to Guatemala. Later he contacts Betty and his colleagues and when he is close to find his cure, Blonsky captures him and transforms himself in powerful beast The Abomination. Dr. Banner has to decide whether he should remain human or transform in The Incredible Hulk again to stop The Abomination.After the ""Shrek-Hulk"" of Ang ""Brokeback Mountain"" Lee, ""The Incredible Hulk"" is a wonderful surprise. The story and characters recall the comic books of my childhood, plenty of action and adventure. For Brazilians and more specifically for ""cariocas"" (people born in Rio de Janeiro) like me, it is funny to see Dr. Bruce Banner living in Rocinha, probably the most dangerous location in my city, where the police is afraid to go, chased by the American soldiers. In real life, they certainly would be murdered by the army of drug dealers. Further, I really appreciated the effort of Edward Norton speaking a couple of words and sentences in Portuguese. But the most important, the story is a great and entertaining adventure and the special effects are really good. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""O Incrível Hulk"" (""The Incredible Hulk"")', 'Dr David Banner is hiding out in Brazil having fled the military unit led by General Ross who wish to study his genetic mutation and utilise it to create a race of super soldiers. Banner continues his studies into a possible cure for his condition with the discrete help of the mysterious scientist Mr Blue. A slip up in the bottling plant that Banner works alerts Ross to his presence and in goes a small unit led by Major Blonsky to tranquilise him and take him into custody. However when Blonsky and his men trap Banner in the plant, Banner\'s pulse races and soon Blonsky learns firsthand why Banner is such an important asset to Ross.The Incredible Hulk was sold as more of a blockbuster experience than the Ang Lee film was and from the very start this approach is laid out in the rapid back story in the credits. This continues across the whole film with some good sequences, comic book references for the fans and plenty of impressive special effects. What that does for you will depend on you but for my money it produced a solid summer blockbuster which is much like Iron Man in construction \x96 ie it doesn\'t pretend to have ""substance"" or complexity in the way the Batman franchise reboot does. Instead it is all about the basic blocks that make up the film and delivering those in a way that is fun without being too demanding or too complex. Hulk delivers on this and has plenty of good action that are greatly helped by the effects being very good indeed, with the decisions made about the look and size of the Hulk working to stop it being silly. Without a doubt it is a ""money up there on the screen"" sort of affair.Having said that though, essentially this does mean that the film comes down to big computer effects hitting one another with New York City taking its traditional summer-time pasting and it did make me wonder about Norton\'s involvement. I respect him a lot as an actor and his scenes do appear to suggest that he sees more in the material than comes across on the screen. As it is he must have spent more of his time doing motion capture than doing on-screen acting and while his presence suggests that he has ideas of depth, nothing worthy of him is forthcoming. The opposite is true of Tyler, who is perfect for this material-light film but is not still that impressive. Roth was a strange bit of casting but he works in his character and is convincing in his transformation. Hurt and Nelson are both good additions who I assume more will come from. The cameos are not too obtrusive (although why can\'t Stan Lee do more of background cameo) and it is really hard for me to fault a film that gives a bit of time for Williams \x96 who even in ""normal"" clothes as he was here will always be Omar from The Wire.The Incredible Hulk is not a particularly dark or interesting film but, like Iron Man it is a fun and energetic comic-book film with good effects, good action and a general sense of good humour running through it. It won\'t blow you away outside of the realms of being a summer blockbuster but for what it does it is a perfectly enjoyable film.', 'After the disaster a few years ago (and I didn\'t even criticize the movie for it\'s lackluster CGI or the few action scenes it had, but you can read that in my ""Hulk"" comment somewhere else), Hulk finally arrived! This won\'t be the best movie you\'ve ever seen, nor might it be the ultimate comic to film version, but it more than delivers on it\'s premise.You don\'t have to have watched Ang Lees Hulk to get into this movie, to understand it. There\'s a short intro, that does look a bit like it sums up the things that happened in ""Part 1"", although officially that movie won\'t be mentioned I guess. Ed Norton does know in what kind of movie he\'s in and plays it fairly straight. The (love) relationships work so much better and in more levels than those from Ang Lees Hulk, which didn\'t work at all.Of course the CGI has evolved and is up to another standard here. There is the odd cameo here and there (nicely done) and if you\'re an avid fan of the comics you will be more than pleased (as my friend who is a big fan unlike myself, told me)! But even if you\'re not into the comics, there\'s a great action movie to be seen here (with a slight addition of drama, just enough to not hurt the action part, but kind of elevate it).', ""I would never have considered Edward Norton to portray a comic book character like The Hulk, but then again, I couldn't see Ben Affleck as Daredevil or Michael Keaton as Batman, so in that arena I'd be batting triple zeroes. Actually, Norton is Hulk's alter-ego Bruce Banner, but I think you get my point.I used to watch The Incredible Hulk TV show of the late Seventies with Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno, so it was cool to see the muscular body builder portray a security guard, just like he did in the Ang Lee Hulk of 2003. The same with iconic Marvel comic book legend Stan Lee, opening the fridge and dropping that bottle of Pingo Doce soda. That would have been the tainted bottle from the Brazilian assembly line, but otherwise that whole business with Banner's blood was a maguffin, and probably could have been played for more noteworthy effect.In the action department, 'HULK SMASH' acquired powerful resonance in this one. The big green guy had a field day on the campus of Culver University, and that battle with The Abomination (Tim Roth) was an all out blast. The CGI for those sequences was stand-out and creative as well, like when Hulk tore a military vehicle in half and used them as boxing gloves. But the scene that really grabbed me was when Dr. Sterns (Tim Blake Nelson) tried the 'cure' on Banner and you had the midway transformation between man and beast. Very well done.So all in all, a pretty cool action flick with a neat set up for the Avengers movie when Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) meets up with General Ross (William Hurt) in the final scene. The Marvel folks have a unique way of tying their characters together to leave you clamoring for more."", 'This isn\'t a sequel to the 2003 Ang Lee/Eric Bana version, and compared to that rubbish, this is a great revamp of the popular green anti-hero monster, from director Louis Leterrier (Transporter 2). The story is set after the gamma rays accident with Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) hiding in the slums of Brazil, finding ways to control his anger to stop himself turning into the Hulk. Mainly though he is trying to find the cure to his condition with the help of a computer friend named ""Mr. Blue"", and with Gen. Thaddeus \'Thunderbolt\' Ross (William Hurt) and his troops finding and chasing him, that could prove difficult. After an ""incident"", Bruce returns to America to find past love Betty Ross (Liv Tyler) to get her help to find a cure for his condition. Meanwhile, soldier Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) wants to become like Bruce after seeing his transformation and strength, but obviously more controlled. Bruce and Betty do eventually find ""Mr. Blue"", Samuel Sterns (Tim Blake Nelson) and they try to find the cure, or at least something to help control his condition. It is when insane-with-power Blonsky manages to turn into the big monster, or The Abomination, that Bruce decides he has to try and turn into Hulk again to defeat him, and then he runs away into hiding. The film ends with Gen. Ross being told by Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), aka Iron Man, of a ""team"" being made, so this is either to be a continuation, or spin-off film about all the Marvel superheroes being brought together. Also starring Christina Cabot as Major Kathleen Sparr, Ty Burrell as Leonard, Lou Ferrigno as The Incredible Hulk and a Security Guard and Stan Lee as an Old Man. Norton is much more convincing than Bana, the supporting cast all do very well, the special effects are impressive, and the action and chases are much more engaging. Very good!', 'I found this very entertaining and better than anticipated. Some folks might find it a big slow going in the first half hour but I enjoyed the colors and South American scenery during that time. I also enjoyed the acting of Edward Norton, who usually excels in whatever roles he plays. When the ""Hulk"" appears, it\'s pretty awesome even thought its also pretty obvious how computer-generated it looks....but who cares? The Green Monster might not have looked as realistic as the TV days when Lou Ferrigno was the big guy, but it looked very cool because of its size. If you enjoyed ""The Sandman"" in the last Spiderman movie, you\'ll enjoy this XXX-L version of the Hulk, too.In the finale, you can get to watch two monsters going at each other which has the typical overdone action but still fun to watch action. As for the story, once again, it\'s the same old/same old bash-the-U.S. Armed Forces. Who are the two villains in this movie: two military officers! The military, especially since the early \'60s beginning with ""Dr. Strangelove,"" has always been the left-leading Hollywood\'s prime target.I did a little homework on the Hulk comic book origins and, yes, the police and army were trying subdue the green monster, but only because of the destruction he was causing. In this movie, however, they aren\'t too subtle. The main ""soldier,"" played by William Hurt, ""Gen. Thaddeus \'Thunderebolt\' Ross,"" is shown to be a heartless killer with the usual let\'s-make-a-super-weapon attitude and not-care-about-anything else. His nickname ought to tell you something. Making the military look like evil dummies is nothing new, either, with screenwriters the past half century. In this particular Hulk film, one of Banner\'s allies, "" Dr. Samuel Sterns,"" (Tim Blake Nelson) even admits ""I hate the government."" Of course he does. Anyone in authority is always the villain in today\'s movies. This film is a good example of that kind of thinking. The other weirdo (Tim Roth) has the rank of ""Major.""Other than that, and the always-annoying Liv Tyler, who plays ""Bety,"" the female love interest of Banner\'s, this was a very enjoyable and entertaining film. Norton is a credible and likable ""Bruce Banner"" and Roth is one of the best in the business at playing whacked-out villains. He plays the Major and winds up as the second ""monster"" and he\'s a real hoot! Hurt is a fine actor, too, as movie fans know.One thing filmmakers do these days that I think is very nice is to pay tribute to the old actors who were in these stories years ago, either in film or on television. Here, there is a nice cameo scene by Ferrigno, who still looks in great shape, by the way. The former bodybuilder who was the green monster in the TV series that starred Bill Bixby, has a few lines in here as a security guard that will make you smile. I\'m sure they would have had Bixby in this movie, too, had the man been alive. In the recent Superman film, ""Superman Returns,"" we saw Jack Larsen and Noel Neill, who played Jimmy Olsen and Lois Lane, respectively, on the 1950s ""Adventures of Superman"" TV series. This has been done in a few other movies, too.The ending to this film also was clever and tied in with another recently-issued movie. That\'s all I\'ll say because I don\'t want to spoil the surprise. It makes me anticipate what\'s on the horizon. Overall, this film was fun to watch and I definitely would view it again.', 'I wasn\'t sure if this new reboot-cum-remake-cum-sequel to 2003\'s Ang Lee Hulk would make as good, or better than the predecessor. Turns out that the director Louis Leterrier and writer Zak Penn capture the spirit of the Hulk from the comics with lots of fiery action and panache, if not with the flawed ambition of Lee\'s vision. It\'s a bashing, smashing, exciting summer blockbuster, giving what it delivers for the fans of the books and even the cheesy 70s TV series, even if it\'s not quite a great comic book movie. It\'s also less substantive than other Marvel movies like Spider-Man and Iron Man.Actually, in a couple of ways, it\'s close to being better entry than the previous entry, and not simply because Leterrier is suited for the material. Edward Norton fulfills the role of Banner/Hulk with a level of intelligence and subtlety that is uncommon for a role like this. It\'s great to see him and Tim Roth as Emil Blonsky/Abomination face off and fill up their two-dimensional roles to the hilt. William Hurt is also good as the General Ross, after him with any and all means at his disposal but not a clue to how really to stop him (mostly his role consists of commands barked and some glances of concern over his daughter). Only Liv Tyler is only so-so, often pouting or giving the same look of concern or affection for Banner that makes one pine for Jennifer Connelly from the previous Hulk.There are moments that disappoint or feel unfulfilled (Stan Lee\'s cameo here is just a plot device for a bit with Banner\'s blood in a drink where it could\'ve made for something more interesting than a ""hey, it\'s Stan Lee"" cameo), and the drive of the story for Leterrier is to load it with music in pretty much every scene. But then there are those terrific scenes of the Hulk doing what many of us love best about the jolly green giant: smashing s*** up to pieces, and having the occasional King Kong beat as the only one who can make him calm down is the girl of his life. Hell, we even get an artistically amazing scene when the Hulk first emerges out of the shadows and darkness in the factory. And by the time Leterrier gets us to the climax, with Hulk and Abomination facing off, it\'s like eating a box of candy: CGI coated and with the only necessity to keep the action fast and harrowing, but not rushed.In short, it\'s an improvement in some ways (not to totally trash Ang Lee\'s film), and only as satisfying as a big-budget summer popcorn flick can be. It\'s a fun ride, in short, without too much pretension and good performances (plus, of course, the obligatory ""hint"" for an Avengers movie in the last scene).', 'Having managed to miss Ang Lee\'s Hulk from 5 years ago, I watched this version of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby\'s green-skinned, gamma-radiated monster with an open mind. In a word: AWESOME! Nice recap of the origin during the opening credits before we find Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) in Brazil having basically stayed calm for at least a year. That won\'t last long. There\'s also General Ross (William Hurt), Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) who later becomes The Abomination, Samuel Sterns (Tim Blake Nelson) who tries to cure Banner, and Betty Ross (Liv Tyler)-the general\'s daughter who stands by Bruce through all his trials and tribulations. Great mixture of drama, suspense, and action as provided by director Louis Leterrier. Eagle-eyed viewers who\'ve lived for the last 40 years should have no trouble spotting previous portrayers of Banner/Hulk: Bill Bixby in a television scene from his earlier series ""The Courtship of Eddie\'s Father"", and Lou Ferrigno as a security guard who lets Norton in (He also says something as the Hulk in a later scene). And of course, Stan Lee puts in his Hitchcockian cameo! One more person I\'d like to mention is Ty Burrell-late of the cancelled show ""Back to You""-playing a shrink who also gets involved with Betty. In short, The Incredible Hulk is another very worthy movie made from a Marvel Comics character. P.S. My first real encounter with the Hulk was from a comic book I got for my 9th birthday that had a 45 r.p.m. record attached from Power Records that provided the voices of the characters and narration in that book. The Abomination was the villain in that one.', 'This film is about a scientist who got turned into a green monster after gamma radiation exposure. His quest to make things right is impeded by unexpected events.""The Incredible Hulk"" has a great finale, but a weak beginning. I find the first 50 minutes far too slow. There can be generous trimmings and still does not affect the plot. In addition, how does Hulk in Brazil suddenly end up in Guatemala is not explained. In fact, there have been quite a few instances like this, which makes the story less coherent. The ending fight is quite breathtaking, it makes me engaged and I wish the fight occupied longer screen time. ""The Incredible Hulk"" is good entertainment for the evening.', ""That emerald hued comic book character is back. Edward Norton as the Hulk? Run with it. Dr. Bruce Banner(Norton)now a fugitive lives in the shadows trying to find a cure for his condition of gamma poisoning, that when stressed transforms him into a huge muscle bound monster. The military and especially a rouge General Ross(William Hurt)want Banner found in order to exploit his powers. An antidote seems to be a reality; and back in civilization Banner finds himself against a formidable counterpart much like himself, but bigger. It is aggression versus aggression in a battle of powers as the Hulk contends with the Abomination. An enormously high octane duel makes for an exhilarating mind-blowing finale.Special effects are demanding and control your attention. Liv Tyler is terrific as love interest Dr. 'Betty' Ross. Also in the cast: Tim Roth, Tim Blake Nelson, Christina Cabot and a cameo by Lou Ferrigno. And is there a hint of a meeting between the Hulk and the Iron Man?"", ""I'm not sure what it is about Marvel comics that turns their movies into unsuccessful films. There's some profound consistency in the approach. It clearly originates in a specific concept of what the essence of comic books are about so what matters in translating to the screen.My theory is that Marvel had a fan base in the 60s and 70s (when the form we see was established). The fans and artists reinforced a style which was more spefically rooted in the comic books of the 30s before comics became essentially cinematic.I'm talking about superhero books here. DC was the first to become exclusively cinematic and the first to market that to TeeVee and Movies, which in this context are equivalent.It's precisely the uncinematic nature of Marvel that made them successful as books. The design of the panels is profoundly static. The postures and even the builds (which are the main defining characteristics here) are not derived from any stage. The physical humanness is deliberately removed so that the characters and stories can be more abstractly pure.It's the same crowd that is producing these movies. Unlike, say the Batman series where artists are given great freedom, this production shop controls the approach tightly. That's probably good for the brand, but it makes for pretty tepid movies. Oh, these can be as loud and colorful as the next guy's. But they will never have the power over the soul that \x97 yes \x97 the comics have.And gosh, if Liv Tyler's job is to just look appealing, why would they photograph her so poorly?Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life."", ""Scouring the earth looking for a cure to his gamma ray poisoning, Bruce Banner is in Brazil when the army, who want to harness the monster within him as a weapon, locate him. General Ross and the power hungry Emil Blonsky will stop at nothing to capture Banner and his significant other angry half, but Banner's true love, Betty Ross, and the mysterious Mr Blue, are allies hoping to cure Bruce of his ills, but is it all in vain?Those who hated Ang Lee's thoughtful and emotionally driven version of Hulk in 2003 will find this a far more rewarding experience, a mere 20 minutes in and the green one arrives to raise the pulses and set comic book enthusiasts hearts a racing. Not skimping on action or in fact an emotional core, the makers here have managed to blend both the fundamental aspects of the duality being and almost pulled off a great movie, but it's still some way short of being a comic book adapted classic. The pluses do however far outweigh the minuses, this Hulk incarnation is one you can take the kids to see and they can't possibly be bored, the introduction of the wonderfully named The Abomination as a Hulk nemesis ensures the audience is eagerly awaiting the big smack down, thankfully when it arrives it's thrilling, totally daft and entirely within the spirit of the Hulk origins. Major kudos to Tim Roth who as Blonsky, soon to be the monstrous looking Abomination, delivers a delicious line in ego driven badness, and with a fact of movie life being that a film of this type is only as good as its villain, Roth steps in to keep the film above ropey waters.Annoyingly, considering the cast list here, the film is not without problems. Edward Norton is clearly one of the best actors of the modern age, and his restrained showing here as Banner is certainly not at all bad, it's just an odd casting choice to me, almost as if this role is far too beneath him, watching his turn was like an itch I just couldn't scratch. Liv Tyler as Betty Ross steps into the slender shoes vacated by Jennifer Connelly in Lee's 2003 version, it may be unfair to compare the two, but where Connelly had much emotional heart in her portrayal, Tyler has nothing, and her emotional play off with Norton in the crucial scenes just lacks the spark needed to make it work to the full. William Hurt works well enough as General Ross, following on from his bad boy turns in A History Of Violence and Mr Brooks, Hurt is finding something of a working resurgence in devilment characters, while Tim Blake Nelson perfectly dons the caricature hat of scientist on the edge, Dr. Samuel Sterns.The CGI of Hulk has vastly improved, still a borderline problem, it just may well be that we all should accept that Hulk as a character is never going to be a CGI dream? With that in mind it is perhaps churlish to do down Incredible Hulk based on its entertainment value? Which is certainly very high. Yet it's notable that Edward Norton offers nothing by way of a commentary on the DVD package of the film, Tim Roth joining director Louis Leterrier for the gag track only fuels the fire that apparently leading man and director were well at odds about the direction the film was taking. So is Incredible Hulk recommended to the average thrill seeking movie lover? Most assuredly yes. Is Incredible Hulk a worthwhile comic book adaptation? Well sort of: Better than Daredevil and Darkman, but well short of Spidey and The Bat. At times looking like a cheap knock off of Peter Jackson's King Kong, Incredible Hulk has a willingness to entertain, and maybe we all should just focus on that and enjoy the ride? 7/10"", 'Odd casting makes THE INCREDIBLE HULK, in my mind, an interesting feature film, a second attempt to right the wrongs of Ang Lee\'s HULK. Ultimately, as others in the past have mentioned, by the end, it turns into a video game duel between two monster titans with New York City(..a setting which seems to work quite well as a place where destruction occurs to such a devastating degree)the battleground as civilians, buildings, and transport vehicles are leveled in the process.A scrawny Ed Norton is cast as Bruce Banner, an innocent University student who thought he was testing a serum in regards to ""radiation resistance"", but his girlfriend Betty\'s(Live Tyler) military father, General Ross(William Hurt, wearing a hair piece and facial war scars) had actually tricked him..it\'s in fact a genetic experiment Bruce was injecting, therefore he suffers the horrifying side-effects. If Bruce\'s heart rate reaches a certain high point, upon excitement, he mutates into a gargantuan, muscular monster rampaging through those who dare to combat it. Tim Roth, in an unusual role, is a Russian(..raised in Britain)soldier Emil Blonsky, called in by Ross to find Bruce, soon injecting him with formulas which enhance his recuperative powers and combative skills. Blonsky embraces a difficult opponent, enjoys a challenge, and yearns for the same ability(..to become an unstoppable force like the green hulk)Bruce has. Tim Blake Nelson(..who I think steals the entire film from everyone who shares the screen with him)is a, energetic, unflappable NYC scientist, Samuel Sterns, who Bruce has contacted over the internet regarding his specific condition, looking for a cure that can kill the beast within(..he looks at it as a disease).Actually, my favorite part of the film was the thrilling chase through Rio de Janeiro, as Bruce attempts to escape his pursuers, military men led by Blonsky and Ross, leaping across roof tops and into crowded streets..it\'s quite exciting like a Bourne actioner. The action sequence within a juice bottle factory as unfriendly Brazilian co-workers bring the dormant hulk out from hiding, as Blonsky\'s men close in, is a stunner. Norton and Tyler really have good chemistry and their characters\' romance isn\'t overwrought. Hurt isn\'t as intense or angered as Sam Elliot\'s version in Lang\'s film..he\'s more methodical and cold-blooded. Roth is pure machismo and menace. You can see that he lives for combat against an enemy. The Abomination character is quite hideous with it\'s deformities(..obviously thanks to those ill-advised injections which basically fed more fuel to an adrenaline junkie who covets competition). Great cameos featuring Lou Ferrigno(..still has bulging muscles)and Stan Lee(..the unfortunate who drinks a ""tainted"" juice containing Bruce\'s blood!)..nice tribute to Bill Bixby as well. Quite a lengthly battle sequence within a college campus between Hulk and Ross\' soldiers, using all the weaponry and tanks at their disposal. As expected, the film is effects-heavy at times with Bruce staying active on the run, a fugitive who gains an ally in Betty(..who sternly disagrees with her father\'s operation)along the way. Norton is among an interesting crop of fine multi-talented A-listers assuming the role of hero in Summer Blockbusters.', 'Edward Norton and Tim Roth, when in Human Form, elevate this Reboot of the ""Not So Jolly Green Giant"", originally told in the Underrated Ang Lee Film, ""Hulk"" (2003), adding ""Incredible"" to the Title and Amping Up the Action. This one is ""Comic-Booky"" of the Slugfest Variety. There is an Interesting Opening as Dr. Bruce Banner is Hiding Out in South America as the First Act ends with a Battle in a Bottling plant that is actually Better than the Bloated Behemoth that ends Act Three.In the Middle on a University Campus the ""Hulk vs Military"" Action is also Superior to the Fakey New York Extravaganza. On the way we also get a Geeky Scientist (Tim Blake Nelson) that provides some needed Cerebral Energy.Much of the Film is Laden with Lousy and Uninteresting Characters like Betty (Liv Tyler) and a Cigar Chomping Military General (William Hurt) that is the Thing of Nightmares, with one eye squinting and a ""Gen. Jack Ripper"" Style.The Parts are much better than the Whole as the Movie has Spurts of Style but Sputters in the Story. Overall, Worth a Watch with Low Expectations.Note...Ang Lee\'s Film with Eric Bana was better.', 'Essentially a sequel to both the last film (Banner was in the jungle at the end of Ang Lee\'s film) and the TV series (Lou Ferigno and Bill Bixby have cameos and we hear the theme music) the film is also a restart of it all.As the film opens Banner is is Brazil working to try and find a cure for his problem. When the military shows up to capture him he flees and eventually heads home so that he can make contact with a scientist who is helping him via the internet. Much damage ensues.The action scenes are spectacular and much better than I thought they would be. Its great that even though we are watching what are often CGI characters running around we still have a sense of danger. Betty or any other puny human could very easily get hurt. The battles are not neat affairs and there is considerable collateral damage which plays out in little pieces on TV screens and else where once the battles are over. The battles are also epic in ways that only movies and comic books can be. Hulk is larger than life and what happens when he is engaged in battle is too.The real joy here are the characters which are invest with real weight. I\'ve been reading the comic for decades and this is the first time that General Ross wasn\'t one dimensional.Kudos to William Hurt for giving us a real character. Tim Roth is a blast as Blonsky/The abomination. The real story here is Liv Tyler as Betty Ross and Edward Norton as Banner/The Hulk. We feel the weight of their relationship. We feel the love they have and that they are joined forever together. Its amazing. The feelings they have is the reason that much of the film has a real emotional weight. Its nice to have the Hulk smash things but at the same time we care about the characters. We feel the pain in the Hulks eyes when he realizes Betty is in danger. we feel the anger when someone hurts her. Its adds greatly to the film.When the film is ""on"", which is most of the time, its one of the best comic films ever made.Its not just action and heroes its people and characters with real emotion. Much of the film is right on target.The problem with the film is that at times action sacrifices character and a clear plot. We\'re dropped into the action in such away as to make us feel that we\'re missing something. Yes 45 years of the comic, the TV incarnations and the Ang Lee film sort of fill things in, but at the same time its coming in on chapter two of a serial. There is also the publicized battle between Marvel and Edward Norton.Norton wanted a longer more thoughtful film and Marvel wanted this action packed cut. Give me Norton\'s cut. I could be wrong but there are several times as we jumped through time and space or from action scene to action scene, I got the sense that something was missing. More than once I thought a little something was lost- details mostly- that could have strengthened or deepened what we saw. For all I know this maybe the best cut of the film, but at the same time since the action works because of the characters and plot I think that the 15 or 20 minutes that Marvel chopped out could only make things better.Yes I liked it. Yes I frequently said-out loud- ""thats it thats it they got it right"". Yes it moved me.Go see it.8 out of 10 (maybe a little less but not enough so you\'d notice)', ""I recall disliking the overblown, gimmicky and far too somber HULK (2003); even if the creature’s leaping skills were a staple of the original comic (an animated series of which from the 1960s I used to watch as a kid), I found them especially silly in the live-action version – thankfully, here, they’re relegated to the very end. Anyway, when this was first announced, I had little faith that it would be any good: at first, I even doubted Edward Norton’s suitability for the lead but, seeing him in action as Dr. Bruce Banner, he brings the right elements of intelligence, paranoia, tenacity and anguish to the role (his relationship with Betty Ross – nicely played by the luscious Liv Tyler – is very moving, making for one of the more compelling couples in this type of film).As for the Hulk himself, I’m still reeling from the ultra-fake look of the CGI technique: I know having a body-builder painted green (like Lou Ferrigno was in the popular TV series from the 1970s I’m also familiar with) wouldn’t cut the mustard in this day and age of blockbuster movies filled with large-scale gratuitous mayhem…but when the alternative is so unsatisfactory?! Incidentally, it was nice of the film-makers to acknowledge both actors from that earlier incarnation: the late Bill Bixby (the original Bruce…er…David Banner) appears in a bit from one of his other TV series on Brazilian TV(!), while Ferrigno is the lab guard whom Norton bribes with a pizza(!)…not to mention the character’s creator, Stan Lee (he has become a staple of these modern renditions of his work), who’s the old man infected with Banner’s blood at one point.Another definite strong point to the film is the performance by Tim Roth: his typically riveting intensity makes up for the deficiencies of the character as written – so that he’s believable nevertheless as both a man of action and one who’s curious about the possibilities of science (as always, both the experts in the field and the military callously want to use the techniques to their own selfish ends rather than in the service of humanity); even more importantly, he’s an ideal adversary for both Banner and Hulk (when he’s himself transformed into the so-called Abomination). On the other hand, William Hurt disappointingly (I should say, lazily) hams it up in his one-dimensional role of the cigar-chomping General – one can’t help smiling at his apparent ability to summon all the heavy artillery employed in the pursuit of The Hulk at the bat of an eyelid!; having come to his senses by the end, he is seen taking a drink at a bar when he receives a visit from one Tony Stark… The action is the slam-bang, give-‘em-all-you-‘ve-got routine we’ve come to expect in this form of mass entertainment – which, after a while, begins to look all the same (especially in the way Hulk seems to be impervious to practically anything they can throw at him!); besides, Abomination seems to throw in the towel all-too-easily during their showdown (I guess being a monster in love gave The Hulk greater motivation). Since romance in the usual sense isn’t possible because Banner’s accelerated heartbeat would constitute another transformation into the green giant, we get a bit of King Kong tenderness between Tyler and The Hulk himself in a cave but which, thankfully, isn’t carried on too far.I’d never heard of French director Leterrier: looking at his brief resume' on IMDb, it seems he was chosen for this on the strength of his work on the actioner TRANSPORTER 2 (2005)! – he does seem to have an annoying preponderance for sweeping “helicopter” (crane/overhead) shots. In any case, his next film, looks like it’ll be another remake – this time of the Ray Harryhausen mythological opus CLASH OF THE TITANS (1981) which, for what it’s worth, had featured extensive shooting in Malta!!"", 'I think that it is telling that the follow up to ""Hulk"" had a different Bruce Banner, a different Betty Ross, heck even Hulk was different. Without a doubt ""Incredible Hulk"" was markedly better than ""Hulk"", but that is not saying much. I gave ""Hulk"" a three rating, so this one was twice as good.There was definitely better action in this one. The aggressors/bad guys Hulk fought were more worthy and had more to offer which made the action sequences a lot better. I think the \'03 Hulk color and image was good enough without making him grayer with more muscle striations as they did in the \'08 Hulk.I still wasn\'t incredibly impressed with the overall product. Maybe because Iron Man preceded this movie, or maybe it just wasn\'t great, but I thought the movie could still be better. The story was too generic and didn\'t offer much, plus the bad guy was too contrived. Betty Ross detracted from the story and after Spiderman, I\'m getting sick of affection in the rain. Plus, the damage and fights weren\'t creative enough. Sure cars were tossed and structures were destroyed, but I was looking for more ingenious fight scenes such as the small glimpse when Hulk tore the police cruiser in half and used it as boxing gloves. I may be greedy, but I still was looking for more.', '""Transporter"" director Louis Leterrier\'s ""The Incredible Hulk"" delivers the melodramatic thrills and chills conspicuously lacking in Ang Lee\'s self-conscious, brooding, tragic predecessor. Edward Norton takes over the role of Bruce Banner from Eric Bana. Ironically, Norton turned the role before Bana took it. Mind you, Norton is an exceptional actor, but he is basically miscast. Simply said, he doesn\'t look appropriate for the role of an action hero. Meantime, Mark Ruffalo qualifies as the cinema\'s best Hulk. Meantime, Bana was a better fit, but Norton is not without sympathy. Norton\'s Banner is a fugitive on the lam. If you have forgotten Ang Lee\'s ""Hulk,"" Leterrier and Pen use the opening titles to retell the origins of the Hulk in the laboratory. Hardcore Hulk fans may not like this departure from the Marvel canon. The original ""Hulk"" movie followed the same strategy of orchestrating the transformation in a lab.As the action unfolds, Leterrier and ""Elektra"" scenarist Zac Penn have our intelligent hero hiding out in Brazil and slumming as an employee at a dilapidated soda bottle plant. Bruce is their jack-of-all-trades handy man, and his ability to fix things is what gets him into trouble. After repairing a mechanism, he nicks a finger, and droplets of his blood stain the conveyor belt and contaminate one bottle. Clearly, quality control is not a strong point at this factory. When our hero isn\'t working in the factory, he communicates via the Internet with Samuel Sterns (Tim Blake Nelson of ""The Astronaut Farmer""), and they struggle to discover a cure. Of course, nothing works for Bruce. At the same time, Bruce is taking lessons from a martial arts mentor about how to control his rage. He wears a watch that monitors his pulse and develops deep-breathing from the diaphragm to curb his rage. Eventually, after that tainted bottle of Pingo Doce reaches America, an ordinary guy (""Hulk"" co-creator Stan Lee) in Milwaukee experiences a reaction to it, and General ""Thunderbolt"" Ross (William Hurt of ""Altered States"") assembles a team led by an elite commando, Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth of ""Reservoir Dogs""), who is locked and loaded for combat. Blonsky and his team fly into Brazil and narrowly miss capturing Banner. Banner\'s mongrel dog awakens him in time for him to make his escape. Ross congratulates Blonsky for a good job, but Blonsky wants to take another crack at the monstrous green thing he encountered in the factory. ""It threw a forklift truck like it was a softball,"" he tells Ross. Banner makes his way up through Central America and reunites with Ross\' daughter, Betty (Liv Tyler of ""Armageddon""), and Ross is on his trail again. This time Blonsky and his team are prepared better when they tangle with the Hulk on the Culver University campus. Betty tries to convince Bruce to turn himself over to her father. Bruce points out that Ross wants what is in him and will sacrifice him to extract his DNA to forge an army of super soldiers. Bruce reminds Betty that he wants to find a cure. Again, Ross wants to create super soldiers with Bruce\'s super strength and agility.For the record, Banner transforms into the Hulk at about 23 minutes into ""The Incredible Hulk."" Leterrier stages some reasonably good action scenes. Ultimately, the Penn screenplay boils down to a chase thriller that concludes face to face showdown like an old fashioned western between Banner and Blonsky. Tim Roth makes a terrific adversary, but the final confrontation suffers because you know it is just a clash of CGI titans. Liv Tyler and William Hurt are serviceable as Banner\'s girlfriend and another of his adversaries. You can get your quotient of blood, gore, and violence out of this PG-13 epic.', ""I'm not a comic book fan, but everyone knows The Hulk. You don't need to love comics to appreciate this movie.Now, it was an uncredited Robert Downey Jr. that drew me to the flick, but I was not disappointed in what I saw from Edward Norton (American History X, Primal Fear).Liv Tyler, who doesn't get the credit she deserves, was great as the former girlfriend. When they met after a long absence, it was like Garance and Baptiste all over again.William Hurt was you typical military officer - all mission and no feelings. Even his own daughter (Tyler) wouldn't talk about him. He was excellent in the role.Man, Tim Roth was perfect! Tim Blake Nelson was an über Geek, and a real delight.The special effects were tremendous. bring on Hulk II."", 'Over the opening credits, we see how the Hulk was born. Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) and Betty Ross (Liv Tyler) were scientists working on a project involving making the body resistant to certain types of radiation, specifically gamma rays (the most harmful kind, lead sheets required). However, something went wrong, and through Banners or the Hulks, rather eyes we see him destroying the lab, killing some other scientists, injuring the project overseer, General Thaddeus Thunderbolt Ross (William Hurt), and rendering Betty Rosss daughter, of course unconscious. A little later, we see Bruce at the bedside of Betty, who is wavering in and out of consciousness, when suddenly Ross is there with his arm in a sling, screaming at Bruce. Bruce flees, and the hunt begins as Ross tracks down every possible lead he can find on the location of Banner and what lies within him158 DAYS WITHOUT INCIDENTIn a town in Brazil, Bruce wakes up from a nightmare of everything thats happened to him. He groans and goes about his morning routine, which includes feeding his dog Rick and learning Portuguese by watching Sesame Street and comparing what he hears to a Portuguese-English dictionary. He also spends time learning relaxation techniques in an effort to control his heart-rate and keep himself from becoming too excited. He goes to his job as a day laborer at a local factory, handing out dry goods and cleaning up messes while avoiding the old tough guys at a bottling factory. He also occasionally helps out with the electrical aspects when something breaks, which it does today. As hes fixing it and joking around with the manager, he cuts himself on a metal clip and the blood falls through all the grated floors onto the belt, and Bruce freaks out, yelling for the belt to stop. Confused, the workers stop the belt and Bruce inspects the area where the blood fell, cleaning it up and giving it the okay. As the belt starts and people start talking about the crazy gringo, no one notices the drop of blood that fell into a bottle currently destined for the United States of America.Unaware of the contaminated bottle, Bruce starts to leave, but notices the same toughs who usually give him a hard time coming on to an attractive co-worker, Martina. Bruce stops the action by asking Martina if shed like to have lunch with him tomorrow, but the leader of the gang starts coming up to Bruce, who cautions him in Portuguese by saying, Dont make me hungry. you wouldnt like me when Im hungry. Confused, Bruce goes over this just as the manager pops up, enabling him to escape a beating and head for home, stopping along the way to pick up a package from someone. Once there, Bruce boots up his homemade computer and makes contact with someone named Mr. Blue in America. Together, the two of them are working on a cure to Bruces little problem, and after dicing up the package a flower and applying its juice to his blood, Bruce regretfully types, No change, to which Blue types that he should come to New York and get more date contamination levels, exposure rates, types and amounts of radiation, the works. He glances at a photo of Betty he keeps before regretfully saying that he cant do that either and powering down for the night.Meanwhile, at the Pentagon, Ross is receiving a report from his chief assistant, Major Kathleen Sparr (Christina Cabot) that an old man in Ohio died after received gamma poisoning from his fruit drink that came from Brazil (note the man is Stan Lee, Marvel creator). Ross quickly orders a team down there the next day, put together with no small amount of efficiency by his old army friend General Joseph Greller (Peter Mensah). The team is headed up by the Russian-born but America-trained Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth). Ross informs them all that their target is a scientist who has stolen military secrets and that he will definitely be a fighter if cornered. As they fly down to Brazil, Bruce gets a message from Blue saying that he may have success, but needs Bruce\'s blood to be sure, which Bruce reluctantly -- and carefully -- sends off to him. That night, Bruce is sleeping soundly when Rick starts barking. Meanwhile, the commandos have taken up position outside and are scanning the room with a camera, which Rick promptly eats (or tries to). Disgusted, the commandos blow off the door and after tranqing the dog, fire a dozen tranquilizers at a sleeping Banner. They whip the covers off and see that it\'s just pillows. They hit the street after finding a rope, getting a little ahead of Bruce, who is hiding in the apartment of Martina just below him. After giving them a few minutes, Bruce hits the ground but is immediately spotted by Blonsky. He breaks for it, going across rooftops and up the sides of buildings, at one point narrowly missing running right into a too-shocked-to-move Ross\'s arms. As he\'s running, he manages to crash into some people that turn out to be the gang from the factory. They join in on the chase, and Bruce ducks into the factory to lose them all, but unfortunately the gang sees the chain swinging and the troops see the gang. The gang catches up with Bruce and start pummeling him, ripping off his backpack and tossing it aside as he begs them to stop before his heart-rate gets too high, getting out in Portuguese, ""Me....angry....very bad..."" The leader laughs and moves in for the kill while the troops near the fight, but suddenly Bruce\'s eyes flash green just as a dart hits one of the toughs. They blame Bruce and start in again, but suddenly the leader is thrown a hundred feet through walls and the other men are screaming. The troops can\'t make out what\'s happening, but Ross hears the audio feed and begins yelling at them to shoot, go live, do SOMETHING! They switch to live rounds as the last of the gangers is finished and the creature turns to leave, smashing his way out with a big vat of something. The troops open fire, but the bullets just bounce off of him like plastic. The creature roars and starts in on them as Blonsky tries to get in a higher position for a better view and shot. He finds it just as the last soldier is finished. He takes his shot, and the creature notices him. A shadow passes, and suddenly Blonsky is face-to-face with the Hulk. Hulk picks up another vat and slams it down, and Blonsky goes flying as Hulk heads for the jungle, pausing only to give a victory roar. Hours later, Ross and Sparr are going through Banner\'s apartment and computer when Blonsky comes in, demanding an explanation for what he saw out there. Ross just says that he did a good job, and he should tell his men to pack up, since they\'re leaving town1 DAY WITHOUT INCIDENTBruce wakes up beside a waterfall, not quite sure where he is, his pants hanging off of him and torn. He hears a truck and heads for the road, where the driver tells him he\'s in Guatemala. The driver takes Bruce into town, where Bruce proceeds to work his way north and pick up some new clothing while in Mexico. Meanwhile, Blonsky has finally succeeded in wearing down Ross enough to tell him what went on. Ross explains that back in World War II, there were a lot of special programs being worked on to give America the edge, almost all of them under an Infantry Weapons Development program. One of them was a program for bio-tech force enhancment, more commonly known as ""Super Soldier"". About five years ago, Ross dusted off that program and began trying to put it together again. He recruited Banner and his team to work on it, but then something went very wrong....or very right, depending on how you look at it. In either case, the end result, according to Ross, is that Bruce Banner\'s whole body is now, in his opinion, the exclusive property of the U.S. Government. The two men sit there and after an exchange about how they\'re both fighters, Blonsky says that if he could put what he knows now in his body twenty years ago, that would be someone he wouldn\'t want to fight. Ross smiles grimly and says, ""I could probably arrange something like that."" Blonsky merely stares up at him, intrigued.17 DAYS WITHOUT INCIDENT At Culver University in Virginia, we see Bruce heading for the old science department where Hulk was born. However, the appearance of security guards checking IDs puts the kibosh on those plans. Deterred, he heads outside and sees the building housing all science teachers, and who should come out but Betty, chatting amiably with a friend of hers. He stares at her stupidly as she eats outside, and she looks up towards him and smiles. He ducks behind a tree (yeah, that\'ll work), but she was actually smiling at her newly arrived boyfriend, Leonard Samson (Ty Burrel), psychologist extraordinaire. Now deterred and defeated, he heads to an old on-campus pizza parlor where the owner, Stanley (Paul Soles), is an old friend of his. Bruce asks about Samson (insert envy joke here), and then asks for two more things -- a place to stay for a few days, and a job. The very next day we see him delivering pizzas in his old uniform, and one of the stops happens to be the science lab. He talks to the guard (Lou Ferrigno, Hulk from the TV series) and is able to get upstairs, where after bribing the head computer genius with a pizza he gets on one of the computers to look for the data on his experiment, but it\'s all gone. Bruce contacts Blue and tells him the bad news, and then gets out of there.That night, Bruce is getting ready to leave and Stanley is getting ready to close up when two final customers come in.....Betty and Samson. They begin chatting with Stanley as an unaware Bruce comes down the stairs. Just as Stan consents to make them a pizza Bruce opens the kitchen door and sees Betty, who sees him. Her mouth opens in shock, but when she looks again Bruce has taken off. She runs outside but doesn\'t see him hiding behind the dumpster, and once back inside she bullies Stanley into spilling the truth. A while later, we see Bruce walking in the rain on a highway when Betty pulls up behind him. He sees her and she runs to him, begging him not to go. Soon they are pulling into the house she shares with Samson, and she reveals a present she kept for him -- all the data from their experiment on a nice little portable drive. He tells her that he can\'t stay, but accepts her offer of money and a ride to the bus station the next morning. Meanwhile, Ross is pulling a serum out of cold storage and prepping Blonsky for injection, which he warns will hurt. For his part, Blonsky just grits his teeth and tells them to get on with it.The next day, Bruce and Betty are walking through the college campus to the bus station when Betty pauses to fix Bruce\'s shirt, making him more fashionable. As she does, he sees a soldier move behind a column of one building and tells her to get as far away from him as she can. He bolts and as the soldiers move in, she looks around for the command vehicle and convinces Ross to come out, begging for him to stop. He ignores her request and orders the rest of the team in. Bruce ducks into a library and removes his pack. He fishes out the drive and forces it down his throat before moving on. However, the pause has caused the soldiers to catch up to him, and they trap him in an overpass as Blonsky moves in. They fire two canisters of knockout gas into the bridge, but Banner transforms and leaps out. He begins fighting the soldiers, leaping all around them and crushing their vehicles, but Blonsky moves in and leaps around Hulk like a mosquito, peppering him with rounds from a grenade launcher. He gets Hulk to follow him into the path of two sonic blasters which pepper Hulk with soundwaves, but unfortunately, Hulk sees Betty crying out and manages to take them apart using two parts of a nearby sculpture. Blonsky gets pissed and approaches Hulk, and proceeds to get slammed into a tree breaking every bone in his body. Ross orders in a helicopter just as Betty runs towards Hulk. Hulk throws part of the statue at the chipper, which crashes and makes a huge inferno that envelops Hulk, who envelops Betty and keeps her safe from it, though she does go unconscious again. Hulk looks at Betty and sees Ross standing there with Sparr. He snarls at Ross, turns, and heads off. Later, we see Ross\'s boys taking everything Betty owned out of her house as Ross tells Samson that he did the right thing by calling Ross. In turn, Samson calls Ross the bigger threat, since Hulk protected Betty whereas Ross endangered her. Ross says that her safety is his utmost concern, but Samson says that his best feature is that he always knows when someone is lying, and that he also knows now why Betty never talked about him.That night, in the North Carolina stretch of Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Betty wakes up in a cave to the sound of a thunderstorm. She sees Hulk staring down at her curiously and screams. He jumps and hits his head on the ceiling of the cave, but she calms him down. Suddenly, lightning strikes and Hulk screams at it, throwing a rock into the sky at this new challenger. Betty again calms him down, reassuring him as a mother would her frightened child, and eventually he goes to sleep. The next morning, she and Bruce wake up and drive into town, where Betty gets them a motel room and Bruce takes a shower and coughs up the data chip. Betty gets him some new clothes and together they get a used car with cash obtained from the pawning of her mother\'s old necklace. As she\'s paying, though, Bruce uses a public computer to send the data to Mr. Blue, aka Samuel Sterns, at his Empire State University email address. Even worse, Ross\'s team, with the help of the Strategic Homeland Infiltration, Enforcement, and Logistics Division (SHIELD), is able to capture this email and figure out where they\'re heading.....Empire State University. Meanwhile, Ross is checking on Blonsky, who had previously had more broken bits than the Titanic, and is shocked when Sparr shows him a fully-healed Blonsky, who is ""pissed off and ready for round three.""Back with Betty and Bruce, we see them heading for New York when Betty asks what it\'s like when he changes. The best Bruce can answer is that everything is a lot more amplified. Betty points out that there\'s still something of him in there, using the recognition of her as evidence, so maybe if Bruce could control it -- but Bruce interrupts her, saying that he wants to get rid of it. The next day, the pair are in line at the Verrazano-Narrows bridge when Bruce notices a police checkpoint. They get out, sneak around back of the truck, and head down to the docks, where after one boat ride they find themselves in the city and get a cab to ESU, which turns out to be the most frightening ride ever and has Betty screaming obscenities at the lascividious cabbie. As he pulls away, our pair have this exchange:Bruce: ""You know, I could show you some techniques to manage that rage a little better...""\nBetty: ""Don\'t start!""Eventually, the pair get to ESU (with no cabbie murders) and meet the small, quiet, and unassuming young man known as Samuel Sterns (Tim Blake Nelson). Being thrilled to meet both of them, he brings them up to his lab and they immediately start talking, where he warns that if they miscalculate too high, the dose could kill Bruce. In turn, Bruce warns that if the dose is too low, it could be dangerous to Sterns, though Sterns just laughs this off, clearly not believing him (though who could, really?). Regardless, they set about recreating the experiment with little trouble (student-used computers at fault). They manage to draw Hulk out and inject the antidote as Betty struggles to keep Hulk from lashing out. The antidote takes effect, and Hulk reverts back to a hyperventilating Bruce. Meanwhile, on a military base, we see soldiers prepping for moving out while in a locker room, Blonsky examines himself in a mirror. Unnoticed, his spines elongates and extends out from his body the slightest bit. He boards the chopper and Ross asks him how he feels, and he declares, ""Like a monster.""In the lab, Sterns is proposing his latest theory that what they injected Bruce with was just for the suppression of that one episode. He starts to talk about his subjects, which causes Betty and Bruce to stare at him in horror and ask, ""What subjects?"" He smiles gleefully and shows them a room with tons of distorted fetuses and dozens of synthesized bags of Bruce\'s blood, all of which Sterns was able to make from that one sample Bruce sent. Bruce and Betty tell him that they need to destroy all of it, but Sterns can only see a future Nobel Prize. Bruce starts to become agitated, but a sniper suddenly tags him from outside just as Blonsky rushes in and knocks him out, shoving Betty aside roughly. A team takes Bruce out as Sparr stays behind to supervise cleanup, but as they do and as Betty storms onto a waiting chopper and away from the man she no longer wants to call her father, Ross whispers to Bruce just before he gets loaded on, ""If you took it from me I\'ll put you in a hole for the rest of your natural life.""Back on the ground, Sparr is interrogating Sterns when she gets knocked out from behind by Blonsky. Sterns is terrified, but then Blonsky says that he wants Sterns to turn him into what Bruce turns into. Sterns is eager to oblige for reasons that have nothing to do with Blonsky\'s threats, but he does warn Blonsky that the result, thanks to what Blonsky already has in him, could be an abomination. Blonsky lifts Sterns to the ceiling and says that that counts as informed consent, and the ball starts rolling. As Betty and Bruce share a moment in the chopper, Sterns procedure takes hold, and Blonsky -- now the Abomination -- smashes the whole lab, spilling chemicals on Sterns, whose head bubbles weirdly and begins to grow larger and flatter as he grins. Blonsky leaps outside and starts tearing up the streets and soldiers left there, and one of the soldiers gets a message off to Ross that, ""The Hulk is loose!"" Ross glances at Banner, who appears just as shocked, and says that\'s impossible. They manage to get a visual on-screen, and they see the Abomination tearing apart the city. Bruce realizes that only one thing can stop that and Ross agrees. They move over the site and open the back door. Betty begs Bruce not to do it saying that they don\'t know if he\'ll change, but he says he has to try. They kiss each other, and then he allows himself to fall backward. He passes the level of buildings, manages to say, ""Oh, shi--""SMASH!!!A huge hole appears in the middle of the pavement, down the street from the Abomination. The Hulk slowly pulls himself from the hole, and roars. Blonsky hears and grins, and the two monsters run towards each other. They leap and collide in mid air, with Blonsky carrying the way, dazing Hulk slightly and punching him down the street. Hulk shakes it off and tears a police car in two and launches it at the Abomination. Blonsky takes the hit and then unleashes one of his own, punching Hulk through a building and way downtown. The Abomination roars in delight and chases after him, climbing up and over buildings to catch up as Ross orders the chopper gunner to open fire on Blonsky. Blonsky barely avoids all of the bullets and catches up to Hulk, pummeling him some more before deciding to grab hold of the copter. Hulk sees this and then sees Betty in there, roars, and grabs hold of Blonsky, creating a copter-Abomination-Hulk chain. The pilot says that it\'s too much weight and he has to put her down while Hulk and Abomination continue their battle on the landing struts. The battling becomes too much, and the chopper finally crashes near a construction site (always the way...). As Betty and Ross pull themselves from the wreckage, Blonsky keeps beating on Hulk. Suddenly, a spark from the main rotor hits a gas puddle below the chopper. Hulk sees this happening, becomes angrier and bigger, and manages to shove the Abomination aside just in time to create a sonic boom that puts out the fire by creating a limited vacuum. Meanwhile, the Abomination has found a huge chain that just happens to have two mace like attachments on the end and is swinging it at Hulk merrily. Hulk manages to get under it, get a hold of the chain, and wrap it around Blonsky\'s neck. He pulls it tight, and Blonsky goes unconscious. He pulls it tighter, determined to kill the source of his hurt and pain when Betty cries out, ""Stop!"" Hulk sees her and calms and obeys. The Abomination is still out, so Hulk tosses him to land at the feet of Ross before letting loose with another victory roar. He quiets, and for a moment, all is still. No one moves as the Hulk gazes distrustfully at all the little people with loud guns around him when suddenly a second chopper appears with a searchlight blaring. Hulk roars in frustration and takes to the roofs again, running off. He reaches the coastline, and...A few days later, we see Betty on Liberty Island, looking sad as she stares up at the big green woman. A beep sounds from her pocket and she pulls out a camera she had gotten while on the run with Bruce to see a picture of him not-quite-smiling back at her beneath the words ""low battery"". The camera suddenly powers down, and Betty sighs, saddened by the loss of the one proof she had of their time together...31 DAYS WITHOUT INCIDENTIn Bella Coola, British Columbia, we see a shack set up deep in the mountains. Inside, we see Bruce addressing an envelope to Betty. When he\'s finished, he opens the flap and puts her mother\'s necklace inside, making sure to not be rough with it. That done, he sits down and meditates, thinking about what everyone told him about control. He closes his eyes, breathes deeply, and opens them again...They are glowing green.On a black screen, we hear General Ross saying Reload. We find him sitting in an ordinary bar in an ordinary city uniform undone. The bartender refills his drink as the door opens. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) enters and sidles up to Ross, offering his condolences on failing to capture Banner and losing control of Blonsky and saying that he did warn Ross against pursuing the Super Soldier program, since it was shut down for a reason. Ross sighs and acknowledges Stark, saying that he always wears the nicest suits, to which Stark smiles and says, Touché. Stark says that he heard that Ross had an interesting problem, and Ross responds by saying, Well, youd know all about that wouldnt you? Not to be outdone, Stark follows up with, Were putting a little team together. Thought you might be interested. Finally letting his curiosity override his caution, Ross says, Whos we?']"
29,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Iron Man 2,1228705,"[""This movie contains some throughly enjoyable moments that are on par with some of Downey Jnr's highlights as Tony Stark. The relationship between Pepper and Tony is taken further and built upon brilliantly in this movie. It contains some really cool and innovative action scenes which are taken for granted now. However the poor villain, a pattern in Iron Man Solo Outings, and the lack of direction meant this is easily the poorest Iron Man Performance. It's still an entertaining watch but you wouldn't be wrong if you skipped this movie when rewatching MCU Classics."", 'For some reason this movie had not been getting the greatest critic reviews. I do not understand that at all. I thought the movie was very enjoyable and a successful sequel in the series.For anyone who has seen the first Iron Man you can expect much of the same in this movie. Robert Downey Jr. plays Tony Stark like he is meant for the part. He has the same sarcastic wit and self-confidence that is evident in his other movie roles. Gwyeneth Paltrow, as Pepper Potts, has a comes more to the forefront in the sequel. I also personally love that Jon Favreau is the driver for Stark/Potts, and that he gets into the action a little bit. You have to respect the director for that, even though Jon has done plenty of acting himself.Normally in when they replace someone in a sequel with a different actor/actress I am very upset. However, Don Cheadle replacing Terrence Howard in Iron Man 2 as War Machine/Lt. Rhodes made me happy. This is similar to what happened with Maggie Gylenhal in the Dark Night.Samuel L. Jackson playing Nick Fury has a bigger role, and it leads all the viewers into wanting The Avengers movie to come out immediately. Scarlett Johansson also showed up with some impressive stunt work, along with her always gorgeous looks.All in all it was a well done sequel. The plot is not too convoluted to follow. The new villain, played by Mickey Rourke, is very impressive and fun to watch. The action scenes are all entertaining but they do not completely drive the movie. The only thing that I wished for leaving the theater was a longer final fight scene.Also, make sure to watch after the credits!! It is short, but worth it.', ""It isn't as good as the original but Iron Man 2 is still a really good sequel. Robert Downey Jr. once again gives an incredible performance and is extremely charismatic. Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Scarlett Johansson, Samuel L. Jackson and Sam Rockwell all give great performances. Jon Favreau's direction is really good and it's consistently funny. The CG is impressive and the music by John Denney is good. However, Mickey Rourke is wasted as a forgettable villain and the final battle is a little short."", ""Downey Jr continues his smirky role as the playboy and laissez-faire persona of Tony Stark (no Downey Jr, no Tony Stark I'd say!), now facing a life-threatening intoxication situation, and constantly having to deflect the US military's interest in and compelling him to turn over the Iron Man suit. Then of course there's the romantic angle with Gwyneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts who gets expanded screen time here, to whom he hands over Stark Industries to by appointing her CEO. I had enjoyed all the scenes between Paltrow and Downey Jr as they shared great chemistry, and didn't mind that the film took the pause from the action to throw the spotlight on this. In fact, Stark is pretty much the Santa Claus in giving away things, having to face his mortality and to put some business continuity plans into motion. A little too bad that the scene in the teaser trailer highlighting the banter in the plane didn't make it to the final cut.But all work and no play makes him a grumpy soul, so enter Scarlett Johansson as Natalie Rushman, his new sexy private secretary from the legal department who is more than meets the eye. Johansson has now proved that she's got it in her to be in an action film, and her limited action scenes here will surprise and leave you breathless. Mickey Rourke seem to have picked off from his Wrestler role in playing the Russian villain Ivan Vanko, riding on the parallel and theme of Fathers and Sons, whose father was seemingly played out by Howard Stark, and is finding it apt to finally take it out on Stark Industries using similar technology the earlier generation developed, and now backed by sugar daddy industrialist Justin Hammer, played by Sam Rockwell. Rockwell plays the classic business rival bitterly humiliated by Tony, and from observing Ivan's potential, decided to bankroll the Russian's capability for the US military. Hating a man in common make for strange bedfellows indeed.Cameo wise, there's Stan Lee if you can spot him in a brief moment, probably his easiest and non event-filled one to date given he's just standing around, Samuel L. Jackson continuing his role as Nick Fury of SHIELD, now assessing Tony Stark to determine if he's indeed the man they need for his top secret boy band, Gary Shandling as the senator pursuing the weaponization of the Iron Man suit for the military, and of course, director Jon Favreau himself who continues his role as Stark's chauffeur Happy Hogan, and you can tell his acting itch from his expanded role in getting in on the fun rather than just solely standing behind the camera.But of course the tongues will wag whether Don Cheadle can pick up from where Terrence Howard left off. Whatever the reason may be for the latter's departure, he will likely be kicking his behind now for leaving the project. That anticipatory look Rhodes had in the first film at the metal suit worn would bring a smile to any fanboy in the know of what would be the next logical step, and frankly speaking I would have enjoyed some continuity here. But having a different actor in a role done by someone else in a preceding film isn't something new, and Cheadle stepped in confidently from the start, helped by the script which puts it in point blank terms that he's there now, and they should move on. Well said, and great job on being War Machine, in a best-friends-temporal fallout subplot which accounted for the action at the midway mark.Justin Theroux, who wrote the screenplay for Tropic Thunder, took over the scriptwriting for this film, doing the narrative justice with plenty of fan-moments, and oh-not-so subtle merchandising opportunities that Tony Stark would be proud of. The excellent casting has the brilliance of Theroux's story to thank for in keeping the many subplots in check, making Marvel fans happy through the plenty of easter eggs peppered around, coming up with an intoxication of a different sort for Tony Stark to deal with and a chance for him to go back to the drawing board, getting his hands dirty with the building of something. Action-wise, yes there is only a handful of them, but each of them brought something to the table in terms of excitement, thrills and spills. The special effects and graphics here were one up against the previous film, and it was a definite visual feast especially when suits got up against suits, warranting a second look at the film just to catch everything that's happening at the same time. The finale was a full 30 minutes worth of action end to end and features the Iron Man-War Machine tag team up, which served up a lot more than what we've all glimpsed from clips here and there. Singapore, this is yet another opportunity to be proud of with our compatriots also involved in the visual effects department, ala Kick-Ass.Iron Man 2 is set to convert the non-fan, and is crafted so that newcomers to the hero could jump right into the fun without needing to watch the first one (why haven't you!). For Marvel fans though, you have Jon Favreau to thank for whetting all our appetites in making this film the teaser to the other upcoming Marvel films such as Captain America, Thor, and I will be right there to holler Avengers Assemble! when the time comes. Stay until the end of the credits for a scene which will make you salivate. A-One!"", 'The sequel to Marvel studio\'s surprise hit of 2008 is here, bigger than ever. But is it better? After the surprise success of Iron Man, expectations for the sequel, from both movie viewers and long time comic books fans, were no doubt high.Picking off where the first film ended, billionaire genius Tony Stark has just revealed to the world his identity as the armor clad superhero, Iron Man. Now he reaps the whirlwind consequences of his actions as both the military and unscrupulous competitor Justin Hammer vie to obtain the secrets of Stark\'s Iron Man technology for their own gain. Too add to the flames, Stark soon discovers that the very technology that is keeping his heart alive is also poisoning him. As he tries to salvage a life that is slowly falling to pieces and his growing feelings for his long time assistant Pepper Potts(Gwyneth Paltrow), Starks has to contend to with a foreign weapons genius named Ivan Vanko who seems to bear a deep seated grudge against the ailing billionaire; a grudge that stemmed from the legacy of Tony\'s father, Howard Stark.Whatever was good in the first movie is carried on in true sequel fashion. The acting and chemistry among the cast is definitely the highlight of the whole film. Robert Downey Jr IS Tony Stark, though less of a playboy following his ""change of heart""(figuratively and literally) in the first movie, but still the same wisecracking, smirky eccentric. Everyone is just so natural in their roles including the villains, especially The character of Justin Hammer, played by Sam Rockwell. Hammer had all the makings of a silly one dimensional villainous caricature, but manages to be a well rounded scumbag of a corporate competitor, providing some excellent comic relief while still presenting a credible threat to the hero.That being said, the script is just littered with witty banter, intelligent jokes and a good number of ""Easter eggs"" for the long time comic book fans. Writer Justin Theroux had a good number of interesting themes going for this movie, most notable of which is the theme of ""legacy"", of what people leave behind when they are gone; their impressions on their successors and how the effects of their past actions would echo down the years long after one has passed. Stark himself, faced with his inevitable demise, does not want to leave a legacy of death as a weapons designer. Aside from that, we see how the legacies of both Stark\'s and Ivan Vanko\'s fathers have affected their present lives.Now, Vanko\'s (played by Sin City\'s Mickey Rourke) is a truly tragic tale. It is easy to pass him off as a ""darth maul"" type character with no other purpose than to provide the hero with a powerful opponent for the mandatory climax. But to the more attentive viewers, one can see how Vanko is basically the dark opposite reflection of Tony Stark. Both are geniuses, both are where they are because of their respective fathers yet different circumstances in life brought them down entirely different paths. The parallels between his origin story of creating the ""whiplash"" powered armor from scrap, getting captured(in a similarly explosive manner) in order to develop weapons for one man to bring down his competitor all the way to his cunning escape plan and his mistaken impression about his dearly departed father are all uncannily similar to Tony Stark\'s experiences in the first movie that led up to his debut as the hero Iron Man and his mistaken impression about his own father.The one thing viewers might not appreciate is that this sequel seems to lack that sense of ""fun"" that the first film had, taking on a more serious tone at times to dish out the more complex themes and even a romantic sub-plot. It really is too bad that the more complex themes are there but not really expanded upon. This leaves a lot of ""could have been more"" moments hanging by the time the show ends. At least the action is satisfying high octane eye candy as Jon Favreau\'s steady directing hand brings out the intensity of every battle scene. Special effects are top notch as usual except for a couple of cartoony looking moments that do require some suspension of disbelief, for example the briefcase that transforms into an iron man armor with armor parts seemingly appearing from out of nowhere.By the time the all too familiar final battle is over and the credits start rolling, one gets the impression that Iron Man 2 could have been a lot more than the sum of its parts. A little longer running time would have fixed most of the story kinks but perhaps Marvel is merely using this movie as a money generator and spring board to something greater.(Blatant teasers are thrown into the narrative itself almost like a running catalog of future Marvel film projects).Topping the first film is no easy feat and of course Iron Man 2 would disappoint a few here and there. But it is nonetheless one of the most entertaining comic book movies that mixes action, wit, drama and cast chemistry so well. If widespread appeal is its purpose, then Iron Man 2 has fulfilled that function magnificently in that even a newcomer to the franchise can kick back and enjoy the show. Marvel studios has started a new legacy beyond great comics. Here is a legacy of comic book movies, true to the spirit of its source material yet tailored nicely to the tastes of the modern movie audience.', ""Iron Man 2 sure delivers the fun but it's such intelligent fun. Honestly, its Stan Lee meets Shakespeare. The Hammer/Stark rivalry is more like Hamlet and Claudius then Superman to Lex Luthor. Iron Man is simply more complex as a character then anything else you'll see in a summer film but it loses none of the spark or none of the pure popcorn fun. How many other films can you say that about? Stark's vulnerability is very much on display here as his personal life crumbles through various unique conflicts. He has to struggle with the government for control of his armor and deal with his growing celebrity. At the same time his personal life takes a turn as a love triangle emerges. He (like soon all of America) becomes attracted to his new aide (the lovely Scarlett Johansson), causing tension with his former assistant but now new Stark Industries CEO Pepper Potts (the also lovely Gwyneth Paltrow). They manage to pull all this off remarkably well and still leave character time for Rhodey and the villains. It's a believable sci-fi story featuring an intellect story that's wild but has the right amount of humor, angst and drama. Like I remember about Iron Man 1, I can't think of a weak moment in the film. The visual effects are incredible. They did the memory of their boss, the great Stan Winston, proud. They set the bar high again. Now the only question is whether they have anything left in the tank for Iron Man 3? I'm betting that they do."", ""Just came back from the mid night premier of the new Iron Man movie. And i have to say it lives up to all the hype that is has created.I'll try not to add any spoilers but please take note that it may contain just a few small ones.Firstly this movie doesn't feel like a second chapter in the Iron Man franchise, it feels more like a continuation of the first movie. Unlike the batman movies where begins and TDK feel like two complete different chapters of the same book, this feels more like chapter 1 part 2 of the first iron man movie.Secondly, Don Cheadle made a brilliant James Rhodes. His performance captured the character much better than Howards' did. I really wish they could have cast Cheadle from the get go. The rest of the performances were excellent as well Scarlett made a very good Black Widow for her first time i think it was very good, hopefully if she is in the third movie she will work on improving the character a bit more.Overall the movie is a great balance between the action, the comedy and the more serious points of the overall plot. Jon Favreau and his team of writers perfectly balanced all the wonderful and sometimes heavy plot lines that have been enjoyed in the comics and brought them all together in this movie. Its brilliant. I give it a 10 out 10, i left the movie feeling very satisfied and i think most fans of the comics and the movies so far will too. Oh just a tip. If your a real fan stay till after the credits roll."", 'Saw the movie in a press screening here are my humble thoughts:Before I start with my short review of Iron Man 2, I have to say two words about Iron Man 1. I really dug the first one despite of being a little disappointed by the grand finale. Robert Downey Jr. kills it, action, humor, pacing... loved it. I\'m not a big comic geek, and not that familiar with the original Iron Man comics, so please excuse if some of the stuff I thought was weird, was actually accurate adapted.So while the opening credits where rolling and I saw all the big names of actors that I happen to love, I really thought that it might be hard to give all of them a fair amount of stuff to do in the movie. And as it happened to turn out, I was right. I was especially disappointed by Mickey Rourke\'s part as Whiplash. Don\'t get me wrong, Rourke was great. He looks mean as usual and I loved every scene he\'s in. Unfortunately Favreau really pulled a Darth Maul on him. After the last fight I honestly sat in my chair and was like ""that\'s it? you can\'t be serious?!"". Rourke\'s Character had almost the same potential (at least from his talent as an actor and his looks in the movie) as Heath Ledger\'s Joker in Dark Knight. But he never lived up to that expectation due to the lack of screen time and, well... a purpose.But the main problem I had with Iron Man 2 was the lack of a meaningful story and motivation for almost all of the characters. We are introduced to Scarlett Johansson\'s ""Black Widow"", and blame it on my lack of knowledge of the graphic novels, but I had no Idea what her purpose in the movie was. The first part of the movie she\'s just the hot secretary with almost no lines. Eventually she puts on a tight super hero costume and tries to find Whiplash. There is a brief action-sequence, where she kicks some ass, but truth be told, Hit-Girl would wipe the floor with Black Widow. What I really liked though, was Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer. He totally killed it and you can tell he enjoyed his part as the sleazy scumbag pulling the strings in the background.I also liked Don Cheadle as James Rhodes (he was on par with Terrence Howard on this one), but I felt his character suffered from the lack of time for character development. There is this scene, where Tony Stark is seriously messed up, partying at his home in his Iron Man suit and randomly shooting stuff. Rhodes is tired of the situation and grabs himself another one of the Iron Man suits, battles Stark and than leaves. With the suit. I don\'t know if that\'s the way it was done in the comics, but I didn\'t like it at all. In the first movie we witness how Stark becomes Iron Man, how he needs to learn to use the suit and become one with it, how he builds it and we can understand, that he is the only one, who could use it that way. Apparently we\'re wrong, because all you need, is the suit. It\'s like anyone could be Batman, if he just could get a hold of his cape. There is no explanation as to why Rhodes can fly this suit like he owns it, there isn\'t anything told about the relationship between Stark and Rhodes. I just felt this part was incredible weak.The whole movie felt like a setup for another movie. Characters are introduced, stuff happens, but nothing really matters, at best it hints, that there COULD be happening something in the future.Another big problem I had though, was the lack of \'magic moments\' and thrilling action, like in the first flick (I still get goosebumps, thinking about how Tony Stark flew in his suit for the first time). Everything just runs too smooth, there is almost no tension, you never think anything could harm Tony Stark, you never feel something bad is about to happen. If I compare this with the incredible Dark Knight, it feels like a kids movie, something like the ranks of Sky High. Plus, there was just to little Iron Man in Iron Man, to little I care about. Iron Man 2 was made to prepare us for The Avengers and Thor, but by being that, it kinda forgot to be something in it\'s own. That\'s the biggest difference to the first flick, who was original, fresh and smart.Sounds pretty much like a bash, but all that being said, I was fairly entertained. The performances of the main characters each were pretty good. The cast was perfect. Of course all the special effects are amazing, with a lot attention to detail. I loved all the \'augmented reality"" stuff going on in Starks garage. The movie is funny (actually it felt more like a comedy than an action flick) and when the action happens, it\'s looking great. The biggest let down is the potential this movie and most and for all the characters had, which wasn\'t used. However this is only the review of someone who\'s fairly unfamiliar with the graphic novel.', 'Reading Iron Man 2\'s plot summary, things sound bleak for our characters. But not at all. This is a breezy, light-hearted, inoffensive affair that saunters at a magnetic pace, with emotional discomfiting a far thought. Which is pretty refreshing, to say the least. In fact, Iron Man 2 is the complete of antithesis of recent comic book movies. For one, it certainly isn\'t darker than its predecessor, absent its slow-burning first half and latched-on social commentary. It also gives itself the poetic license to stretch credulity. This is a movie about a man who flies around in metal suit, blasting away multicolored-haired Russians with electric whips. Realism simply doesn\'t apply, and thankfully director Jon Favreau and writer Justin Theroux take affectionate liberty with the bonds of belief. Yes, Ivan Vanko can secretly build super technology unbeknownst to his suppliers. And yes, the only way to incapacitate a drunken Tony is to beat the crap out of him in a Iron Man suit. No complaints here! Iron Man 2 is also very much Iron Man\'s superior, although partly by default. The first movie was stuck with a pedantic origin story. However, the sequel had no shortage of possible paths to take. Which did it choose? The way you should always go; the road of characterization. Rather than tediously expand upon its universe, Iron Man 2 simply reprises its dramatis personae and sticks them into situations graver than before, upping the ante but reiterating the overall heart and spirit of its predecessor. The characters are well-etched, each snappy exchange rendered with a mature pathos that contrasts with the spurious scenarios that they feature in between of. Iron Man 2 could easily be called a comedy, but the naturalism of the comedy is seamless; you get the sense that it would be impossible to write this movie without having these vibrant characters joke and jeer.To bring the clever screenplay to life is the phenomenal cast. Robert Downey, Jr., as always, is effortlessly captivating. Charisma defined and an scandalously unsung master of versatility (he\'s not just playing himself, people!), it\'s no breaking news that he\'s still one of the most watchable actors ever. He is the perfect Tony Stark, and a more-than-worthy representative of the thinking man\'s action star. His chemistry with Gwyneth Paltrow as the pragmatic Pepper Pots is electric, and she too turns in a fine performance. Wistful, but by no means a damsel in distress, she is probably the realest character.The baddies, just as essential as the hero, don\'t disappoint either. Another wrong from last time round successfully remedied is the lack of genuinely menacing villains. Jeff Bridges honored us with his always-welcome presence in Iron Man, but his warm affability was anything but menacing. This time, however, Mickey Rourke and Sam Rockwell (oddly, both novices to blockbuster attention) are on duty, offering more than enough bang for your villainy buck. Rourke as Anton Vanko/""Whiplash"", supplements a composite of the unintentionally hokey showman, supercilious mastermind, and the seemingly unstoppable behemoth. This effectively fends off one-noteness, and Rourke perfectly embodies the duality of Vanko\'s deceptively boorish visage and surprisingly vast intellect, while still indulging in the welcome irreverence that comes with the comic book villain (his Russian drawl is humorous but gives him an otherworldly conviction).Rockwell, on the other hand, is flat-out comic relief as Stark\'s weaselly rival – though not necessarily a threatening one – Justin Hammer. He is excellent in the part; an absolute delight to watch, whether irascibly mugging in a loss for words with his insubordinate partner Vanko or, in one of the movie\'s best moments, shamelessly accolading his own (faulty) inventions with juvenile zeal.Unfortunately, with all these characters butting heads for screen time, co-stars Don Cheadle and Scarlett Johansson as Tony\'s pal Colonel James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes and eventual partner War Machine and alluring temptress of a new assistant Natalie Rushman, respectively, are given the short straw. Both are more than able of carrying a scene, but while the script lavishes Tony with many moments in which to brood his way into some fine character development, and to convey Pepper\'s many grievances, neither supporting character is as lucky. Cheadle\'s moments of potential are all obstructed by the War Machine suit, and everything otherwise requires him to lucidly voice reason as a foil to the devil may care Tony. Johansson is a non-event, her Natalie Rushman an amoral nothing role, and her Black Widow guise is not so much daring femme fatale as listless sex symbol. She acts as merely a vessel for fan service, be it in her skintight suit for the general audience or that she represents another stepping stone to an Avengers movie for esoteric comic book fans.The movie is inter cut between the scenes of terse characterization and octane action. The latter is a dizzying combination of rapid vicissitudes and toe-to-toe skirmishes, high on CGI, low on genuine peril. In fact, Iron Man 2 could quite possibly have been a masterpiece of the genre had it lived up to its first forty minutes of exuberance and intrigue. But once the clumsy pugilism of Iron Man and Whiplash takes place, the movie falls flat. The power play is nonexistent, because it\'s hard to believe anyone could stand a chance against ol\' Shellhead. And if no sense of alarm can be conveyed when Iron Man is caught in an unusually melee showdown, the flight sequences leave no impression. Yes, the special effects are astounding, but it\'s all for nothing if there\'s no dramatic undercurrent.Otherwise, please, don\'t mistake my raving for fanboy hyperbole; Iron Man 2 is great. It\'s well-written, well-acted, and simultaneously a loving throwback to comic book norm and a break from recent tradition. It\'s a rare occurrence to be thankful for, because God knows if this follows the superhero trilogy formula, the third one will suck. Which would tragically make this movie\'s thrilling departure from cliché null and void.', ""At first, when a heard about a second installment, i thought, i was unsure in it, because Jon Favreau is relatively new on the director's chair, so could he pull of another classic superhero movie?The answer is simple-YES! I saw it in its opening day and the theatre was full.I went along with a few friends, and all of them loved it!Here are some things, we all agreed we liked.CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT:It was pretty good in this movie-making aspect, although it is an action movie, there is some quite exciting development, especially the leads.Don Cheadle made a perfect substitute of Terrence Howard, and looked pretty good in the movie.So did the Gwyneth Paltrow and Scarlet Johansson's heroines.For me, Scarlet is one of the most gifted and talented and in the same time, the most beautiful actresses in the last decade and even more.And last, but not least, of course, the Iron Robert Downey Jr., making one of his unique, specifically for him, roles.He is smart, funny and in the same time, well, action hero type of guy-he adds so much to this otherwise, stereotyped role.Sam Rockwell was a little irritating, but that's what his role is supposed to be, and to those who have doubts, yes, Mickey Rourke made a decent and interesting role again.TIMING:Almost perfect, except, maybe, the opening credits and a few over timed scenes afterwards, everything was alright and on the perfect spot.PLOT/STORY:I finally can say it-YES, the day has come.A day, where superhero movies haven't got just CGI, put a pretty decent story, attached to the normal amount of CGI.Well, hard to say normal, a little bit over-the-top, but nonetheless fun, when you get use to the headache.The humor was perfect, brilliantly touched to the smallest line.And most importantly-it's not that predictable-i don't mean the ending, but the development, leading to it.Excecutet skilfully, when looked from this point of view.CGI:10/10, nothing else to add.Believable Flawless.Perfect.With no big flaws or plot holes, very funny dialogue, skillful acting and good directing, Iron Man is definitely the best movie of the year so far.The perfect blockbuster as well.I'm glad a saw it, and if the first one didn't made me a fan, this one did.I can't wait to see it again.Cheers to Iron Man Amazing! I would've given this a ten, but with some very few weaknesses, i'll lower this a little, although it did make me a bigger fan than before...My rate: 7.5/10"", ""There's RDJ and his immeasurable charisma, there's Rockwell and Rourke rocking their lines, there's classy Paltrow and shallow ScarJo (bait for the horny nerds), there's good action.. and yet, something's missing. Don't get me wrong: this movie is FUN, from beginning to end. Too much talking? No way. Not enough action? Maybe, but there's plenty (2 fights, 1 'friend ruckus'). But the thread that ties it all together don't seem to be that strong (I blame it on Theroux). Anyway, go see it, you won't regret. One more thing: don't believe people telling that this movie talks way too much about the Avengers: a few bits here and there is not too much. And stay for the after-credits scene."", ""At its high points - the first act and the climax - Iron Man 2 is actually better than the first film. Everything up to and including the action scene in Monaco is just great fun to watch: the action, the character interactions, and of course Robert Downey Jr's wonderful portrayal of Tony Stark. And the action scene at the end is pretty epic.The problem is, the film just stops being so much fun in-between. In a large proportion of this time, it's either going too slowly with little happening that's exciting or even particularly interesting, or it's providing some silly moments like Iron Man lounging on a giant display donut. To be fair, there's no problem with the many subplots this movie has: they all blend together quite smoothly.The acting in this film deserves credit: almost everybody does a great job. Robert Downey Jr and Gwyneth Paltrow are just as entertaining as they were in the first film, Jon Favreau gets more to do as Stark's chauffeur, Don Cheadle is actually a little better than Terrence Howard as Rhodie (again, maybe because he has a bigger role), Mickey Rourke portrays a decent but overall ordinary villain, and once Scarlett Johansson is allowed to do something substantial with her own action sequence, she's well worth watching. The only weak link is Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer, who gets quite annoying after a while.Overall, Iron Man 2's slow middle section prevents it from being better than the first film as a whole, which is a shame considering how brilliant the beginning and end segments are."", 'I liked the first Iron Man movie quite a bit, but there was a good deal of things in it that I was critical of. I felt that several bits didn\'t work very well, and the level of excitement just wasn\'t that great.They sure remedied that in the sequel!! Okay, so Scarlett Johansson didn\'t have much to do. Okay, so a couple of minor scenes were less than realistic (like, why do Happy and Pepper stay in the wrecked car during the fight when they could just run to safety - that sort of thing). And okay, so the drone army was not that threatening and didn\'t pack much of a punch. Aaand, Sam Rockwell\'s Justin Hammer was played a little bit too much for laughs. But these are very minor things. The overall mesh of plot lines, character interactions, comic book references, humor, action and sheer visual candy combined to produce the greatest entertainment value of any Marvel-based superhero movie yet. Hot damn!One of the things I liked best was the ""slow"" part in the middle where Tony watched the old film from his father, and found the structure of the new element in the ""key to the future"" model city (a city which had also actually been built, and in the center of which the climactic battle took place). Great effects, great plot element! :-) And the particle accelerator he threw together; that was massively great fun for me!There were a long list of comic book references in this movie that everyone who hasn\'t read the comics will naturally have missed. For instance, the reason they turned Justin Hammer into the Sam Rockwell type (Rockwell tends to play the same character, always sporting his trademark Nervous Chuckle) was to make him a comical element. In the comics that character is older and tough and very confident, but the movie version consciously parodied him in order to add more humor to the movie. Not that it needed it; it had plenty to go around!I just don\'t have any rally major gripe about this movie; I thought it was fabulous entertainment and much better than the first. Who SEZ this isn\'t the Mighty Marvel Age of Great Comic Book Movies?!9 out of 10.', 'First of all, if you expect to see lots of action in this movie - you will be disappointed! Basically, all the action you will see in this movie is what you saw in trailer. I know people have different tastes. I prefer action over drama and comedy, some people prefer different. So just so you know, this is written from action lovers point of view. First Iron Man had lots of action and was pumped with adrenaline, that is the biggest reason I liked it. This part just doesn\'t cut it for me. Here are few things I disliked a lot about this movie: there are a lot of random things in this movie, an example: while there is formula race about to begin, Tony decides to jump in one and race. I don\'t know if i missed some important part in this movie but I was like ""What the hell??? That makes no sense how the hell did they let him???"" or Tonies birthday party, man that was some random stuff right there. there is this agent played by Scarlett Johansson. To describe her shortly: she is James Bond 2. She can do anything: beat 20 guards? you bet, hack system made by a guy who hacked into important military system in 10sec? no problem. Just an examples, you will see through movie, don\'t want to spoil it for you. I expected 20-30min intro and then some epic action with great special effects, but I had to wait an hour and a half for that and it wasn\'t even epic! OK, movie is coming to an end, time for epic battle! Just kidding, fight is over before you say ""cookie"" stupidity of some scenes concerning highly sophisticated technology and system (also jail) security, an example: guy breaks through pentagon-like security system in 10sec, there are more things I\'d like to add but I don\'t want to spoil it much for you as I mentioned. this movie is... boring. Talking, talking, talking, more talking, the worst part is - this talking isn\'t even interesting! After 30min of talking all I heard was bla, bla, bla... If at least it was something worth listening to, but only parts worth listening to were where Tony makes a good joke. Now, why did I give it a ""high"" 5/10 if it was disappointing (overall)? 1. Great special effects 2. This movie made me laugh A LOT3.Scarlett Johansson looks better then Megan Fox in Transformers.This movie should be tagged as (in this order) Comedy, Drama, Thriller, Sci-Fi and Action as last if you ask me. I don\'t think I wasted 2h on watching this, but I expected more, much more...', 'The makers of this film held nothing back. When it works, as it does here, it rekindles even a cynic\'s movie love. So kudos to Downey, Paltrow, Cheadle, Scar-Jo, Rockwell, Rourke and especially Favreau. What a film! It is a sight to behold. Every scene was captivating, whether it was full on armor action or the charismatic ""down time"" delivered by the best cast possible. Isn\'t that what movies are suppose to be about? It\'s good to see the response to the movie has been, for the most part, positive. I\'ve noticed that sometimes expectations are unreasonable or some fans are too attached to their comic book preconceived notions. (X-Men and Wolverine fans I\'m looking right at you!) Iron Man 2 stayed close enough to its roots and I hope most judge it as a film first. If you do, I\'m almost certain that everyone will enjoy it as much as I did. It easily fulfilled and then exceeded all of my expectations. The only thing I worry about is that they may be setting expectations for that Avengers movie too high. How can it possibly live up to the standard these movies are setting and setting up????? Iron Man 2 is EVERYTHING you would want in a movie and much more! It is a special treat when a sequel reaches up and delivers an excellent film that you thoroughly enjoy as much if not more than a beloved first installment. It truly feels like they just paused and kept telling the same story but with more of an edge. Hopefully, they can do it again and skip that third movie curse. Think of it as another installment and they\'ll be fine. Fitting Avengers in to the mix is even more fun to think about but I heard that Favreau will be involved with that as an executive producer. So, I\'m not worried. In the meanwhile, we can all enjoy this film because it stands on its own but as a great part of a running saga.', ""I liked it a lot better than the mixed reviews I was reading would have led me to believe. It's not as fresh as the original, but the charisma and humor were there, and so were some great surprises. RDJ was amazing as always - it's hilarious that Iron Man is a funnier superhero than Spiderman, but the improv makes it work. Thumbs up! I think that anyone who enjoyed the first movie will like this as well, and enjoy a great thrill ride! And don't forget to stay after the credits for yet another Marvel movie tie-in that leads towards the inevitable Avengers movie in 2012! Don Cheadle did a good job - ScarJo was good, but not what I imagined the Black Widow to be like, but she *was* hot... And Gwyneth did her usual impeccable job. Mickey Rourke added weight to what could have been a cardboard cutout stereotype, and Sam Rockwell's character, though annoying, was well played."", ""Yes, I'm one of the fortunate few who got to see this gem a bit early and I'm happy to report that they took what worked so well in Iron Man and ran with it in an extremely gratifying way. The complexity, depth, heart and action are even more off the charts than the first film. It's is not just a great comic book movie but a great movie period. They took the complexities of Tony Stark that they established in movie one and built upon it masterfully. Now we get a reformed and guilt ridden weapons manufacturer weaved with a celebrity who should have never let the cat out of the bag in the final moments of Iron Man 1. They promised to up the action from the first film and they certainly did but the storytelling never suffers for it. Like in 2008, the evolution and growth of the characters is of paramount importance. It has the same flavor and humor of the original and it may even focus more on the fabulous relationships already developed. I was stunned at how they managed to deliver a better film. I didn't think that was possible. Everyone came to play and this great cast brought their best stuff and it shows on screen. Everyone knew Downey, Paltrow and Cheadle could act but Bill O'Reilly and The CNN anchor? Yes, they show up and do a GREAT job in extended cameos. Rourke and Rockwell are PERFECT as the duel foils for Tony Stark, I mean PERFECT. From the Grand Prix in Monaco to the amazing finale, buckle up because this is one intense, interesting, intelligent and fun ride. My only real complaint is that Scarlett's Black Widow has too little screen time. Still, a film that leaves you clamoring for more isn't the worst sin in the world.When I was done viewing this movie, all I could think about was how it instantly stacks up to the all-time great sequels. What was said about classics like Spider-Man 2, X2, Empire Strikes Back, TDK and even Godfather 2 holds true for Iron Man 2. I honestly can't wait to see it again."", 'First, let me get this right; I am a FAN of the first Ironman movie;the American war propaganda machine looses its hero (the best weapon producer) when the Ironman character realizes after being confronted with suffering and death that peace is guaranteed by ""having a bigger stick"" than your opponent (good so far,.., but nevertheless fun with a bit of criticism); ""welcome tony stark, the most famous mass-murderer in human history""(Ironman 1)- great; and so Ironman is created by tony stark, a charismatic, smart genius (very good performance from Robert Downey Jr.);and here in Ironman2: NOTHING, NO STORY, NO PLOT, EVEN NO ACTION; NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT; just nothing; the tony stark character isn\'t even smart anymore; he is just arrogant and sometimes accidentally funny;when you watched the trailer you have seen ALL the action sequences (and i really mean ALL!) in the whole film; the whole film is filled with senseless dialogues; why replacing Terrence Howard with Don Cheadle??? Terrence did a good job, Don Cheadle doesn\'t fit in (although he was great in Traitor) Mrs. Paltrow is just annoying, annoying, annoying; Samuel L. Jackson just makes a 2 min commercial for the avenger movie; Sam Rockwell, well.., not so good:)the only positive thing are the action scenes with Mickey Rourke at the beginning (just at the beginning..so about 5 min)and Scarlett Johanssons scenes ;) If you liked transformers 2, you will be satisfied with this brainless try of entertainment; My native language isn\'t English.', ""Jon Favreau knew exactly what he was doing with this movie. This is a sleek, no-holds barred superhero movie, with great performances from Robert Downey Jr. and Mickey Rourke. Let's face it, it was almost impossible to top the first one; nevertheless this a good sequel to one of the best superhero movies ever made. Scarlett Johansson fulfilled her role as the the sexy and cunning agent Natasha Romanoff, and Gwyneth Paltrow is fine as Pepper Potts. Sam Rockwell plays Tony Stark's competitor, and does a pretty good job at it.The only problem I have with this movie is that too many things have been fitted into 124 minutes. I understand that the movie was meant to be a roller-coaster ride, intended to thrill, but a little more character development would certainly have helped the movie. For example Samuel L. Jackson ans Johansson's characters are underused. Also, the ending was a little disoriented and predictable; something just didn't feel right about it.All in all, Jon Favreau has made a movie that would please the fanboys and satisfy the critics. This is a movie that entertains, while still complementing the first movie, and setting up a third movie. If you liked the first movie, just go ahead and watch this movie - you won't see a masterpiece, but you'll have a fun day at the movies.P.S.- Watch out for the after credits scene"", ""I think I like this movie as much as the first one, it's not better, it's not worse. It's a pretty entertaining movie and I really enjoy it.Now that the world knows the identity of Tony Stark and that he's really Iron Man, people have constantly been trying to recreate the Iron Man suit for their own personal gain. And the government tries to get Tony to hand over his, like that would ever happen. Tony continues to save the day until a man comes out of nowhere, with a similar suit and wreaks havoc. Overall, I give this movie an 8 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Awesome."", ""After watching the first Iron Man and enjoying it, I thought that the second would be mediocre at best. Well, I can honestly say that didn't happen because I found Iron Man 2 be just as fun and action-packed as the first one.The film starts off very nicely, with recordings from the end of the first film where Tony Stark tells the media that he is the man in the iron suit. The scene then cuts to Russia where we're introduced to our villain, Ivan Vanko watching his father dying. It appears that his father, Anton used to work with Tony's father, Howard, and somewhere down the road, Howard seized Anton's ideas and booted him to the curb and for this, Ivan swears revenge on Stark. Meanwhile, the palladium core of Tony's arc reactor that keeps him alive is slowly killing him and he can't find an alternate. He begins to become increasingly irresponsible and downhearted about his looming demise, and decides not to tell anyone about his ailment and appoints Pepper Pots as the CEO of Stark Industries and employs Natalie Rushman as his personal assistant. While racing in the Monaco Grand Prix, Tony is attacked by Vanko, but is able to fight him off. Now, Stark must get his life back together, build a new reactor and stop Vanko.While most sequels try to up the ante, Iron Man 2 comes across as a brisk and harmless film that meanders along at an attractive clip, with emotional discomfort a distant thought which is very refreshing. In fact, Iron Man 2 is the total opposite of some other comic book films. For example, it's definitely not darker than the first Iron Man and also gives itself artistic freedom to extend on the impossible. Common sense simply does not work here and Jon Favreau and screenwriter Justin Theroux have a lot of freedom with the chines of reality. While the first Iron Man was an origins story, the sequel had no lack of possible roads to take, so it decided to go with the characterization road and instead of developing its universe, the movie merely takes it's cast of characters and tosses them into circumstances grimmer than before, upping the stakes but at the same time echoing the spirit of the first one. The characters are well written, each quick conversation decided with a mature bleakness that differentiates from the illegitimate situations that the film features and while the movie could be labeled as a comedy, but the humor flows so perfectly that you get the sense that it would be out of the question to write this film and not have these characters joke with one another. There are a number of themes in this movie, the most notable one being one's legacy, of what we pass on when we pass away; the impact on those who follow us and how the consequences of past actions can ricochet down the line long after someone passes on.The visual effects in this film are fantastic with lots of explosions, ear-jolting sound effects, stunning camera techniques and cinematography to keep the audience focused. As for the action, there's only a few scenes, but they all bring a lot to the movie by bringing the viewer a ton of excitement and delight, especially the finale, a 30 minute visual feast for the eyes and senses of Iron Man and War Machine battling Whiplash and his drones, which left me hungry for more. The soundtrack is darker than the first film and has some outstanding tracks along with a great soundtrack with songs by Daft Punk, Queen, and AC/DC.The acting is incredible just as it was in the first film: Gwyneth Paltrow once again proves herself as Pepper Potts, bringing a lot of sadness to the role, but is by no means a damsel in distress, not to mention she and Downey have wonderful chemistry, Jon Favreau returns as Happy Hogan and gets to have more fun in the movie rather than just staying behind the camera, Sam Jackson pops up again as S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Nick Fury sowing the seeds for later MCU films. Don Cheadle picks up right where Terrance Howard left off in the first Iron Man as Rhodey/ War Machine, stepping into the role with certainty and proves himself to be superior to Howard. Scarlett Johansson is awesome as Black Widow, proving she is more than capable of being in an action film and while she isn't on screen for much of the movie, her flight scene in the hall does leave an impact. The villains of the film as just as important as our heroes and they don't disappoint with Mickey Rourke adding a combination of a contrived show person, arrogant mastermind and an overpowering monster, while perfectly personifying Vanko's rude visage while Sam Rockwell is complete comic fodder as Tony's business rival, Justin Hammer. Rockwell kills it in this role and is a joy to watch, either when he's losing his temper with Vanko or awarding his own creations with childish enthusiasm. But the true heart and soul of Iron Man 2 comes from Robert Downey Jr. He is the mind, heart and spirit of the man in the iron suit which makes me think if the film was written especially for him. When it comes to Stark's vain personality and sarcasm, he also shines there too, providing us with a ton of great quips and laugh-out-lord moments and while Downey does portray a selfish, egotistical playboy; he is still a likable character. Much like the first one, RDJ is and will always be Iron Man.All and all, Iron Man 2 is a worthy successor to the first film, proving us with more of what we loved with more action, humor, a killer soundtrack, stellar performances and a great story. Definitely give this film a watch, you'll have a blast."", ""The sequel to the excellent Marvel adaptation Iron Man isn't as strong as the original in the story department, being a fairly routine 'villains vs good guy' tale that does little to develop the central character; it also suffers from some interminably inane dialogue (people are talking, but they don't really seem to be saying much). Thankfully, the film compensates somewhat in terms of sheer spectacle and excitement (and I'm not just talking about Scarlett Johansson in a figure-hugging leather catsuit!).The first of Iron Man 2's incredible action set-pieces introduces Mickey Rourke's Russian villain Ivan Vanko, who causes mayhem during the Monaco Grand Prix in an effort to kill Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and thus avenge his scientist father, who he believes was cheated outed of fame and fortune by Tony's father Howard. He fails of course, but not until he's trashed several F1 cars mid-race, slicing them in half with his 'power-whips'. Great stuff!Vanko is given another chance at killing the playboy billionaire turned superhero when unscrupulous weapons manufacturer Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) busts him out of jail and gives him the means necessary to develop an army of drones. The film culminates with the inevitable smack-down between Iron Man and Vanko's obedient robot warriors, a satisfyingly chaotic battle full of big guns, grinding metal, and destruction on a massive scale.7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb."", ""This is, without a doubt going to be one of my top 10 movies of 2010, quite possibly the number one film. I really can't see anything that could possibly top this film. One of my favorite movie going experiences EVER. I was thrilled with Iron Man back in 2008 but this takes that experience and adds to it. I'm so happy to report that unlike other sequels made only for a cash grab, Iron Man 2 delivers on every front possible. There is no doubt why IM2 will be the box office smash of 2010. With good reason, the film is well worth the price of admission, more so then any movie I've seen in years. Director Jon Favreau has done it again, with great style and flair. The new actors are injected perfectly. Mickey Rourke, Sam Rockwell and even good old Garry Shandling are exceptional. We all knew Scarlett Johansson could handle the sex appeal but she's especially good as Tony's new assistant/SHIELD operative. Don Cheadle trumps Terrance Howard's Rhodey in every way. I'm also relieved to report that Robert Downey Jr. and Gwenyth Paltrow are even more amazing in their lead roles. They've really grown in to embodying these wonderful characters. What many don't realize but soon will is that this film has tremendous depth. The lead characters all respond to turmoil and are fleshed out beautifully. Judging by the commercials, people may expect wild action but they are going to be pleasantly surprised at the complexity and depth of the film itself. What only adds to the experience is the fact that they managed to deliver fun in to the equation. This masterpiece is one of those rare summer event movies that really does deliver something for everyone."", ""I went to the premiere last night and maybe it's because I've just discussed the movie with some friends that I'm still excited about it, but I truly enjoyed it. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll only state that there's old,new and more depth. That said I may be a bit on the generous side regarding my score, but it contains some of my favorite actors and the performances to go along with it. Downey Jr performance is excellent and Rourke(!) is still a hero, though my Russian is much better. ;) The incredibly beautiful ladies in this movie are as stated. One thing I thought was a pity was that Scarlett Johansson could've been given more time on the big screen, but maybe next movie will sort that out. I'm not one to criticize the directors vision and I won't, seeing as it's like the last movie, but more fun stuff. The Stark character has some funny moments that you don't want to end. Cheadle and Downey seems to have a chemistry that really works, but it may be good performances (what acting is all about). Marvel action at its best and yes... I'm easily amused."", ""I'll put it very simply, I think this movie was really cool. Excellent story, visual effects, action, all of it combined masterfully to create a great film that delivers entertainment and style throughout, without sacrificing a good plot. It has all the right elements and the cool elements in a proper balance making it fun yet not dumb.I liked a lot Iron Man 1 and I think if you also did so, then you would most likely like this one too. I really like films of this genre like Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, Hellboy 2, Watchmen and I think both Iron Man films are up to the level. It's great to see that this sequel is as good or even better than the first one.I absolutely recommend this movie, it kicks major ass."", 'The movie opens several months after the events in the first Iron Man movie. We are introduced to a man named Ivan Vanko. Ivan\'s father Anton is slowly dying and telling Ivan his final wishes. Ivan thinks he should have the fame that Tony Stark is enjoying but Anton tells him to ""ignore that garbage."" All Anton can give Ivan is his knowledge. Ivan takes a blueprint that has his father\'s name on it, and also the name of Howard Stark, Tony Stark\'s father. Ivan then sets about recreating the Arc reactor and begins building his own weaponized suit. Tony Stark has become a champion for world peace thanks to the Iron Man suit, and has practically solved the issue of world peace, or so he claims.Six months after the end of the first movie, Tony Stark has used his Iron Man armor to bring about a negotiated peace treaty between the major super powers of the world, and his immense popularity with the general public is only furthered when he fulfills his father\'s dream by reopening the ""Stark Expo"" in Queens, NY, to showcase all the latest inventions that will benefit the world. Tony fulfills this dream by flying into the expo in full Iron Man regalia, and making a flamboyant entrance to become the new symbol of world peace. Backstage, following his address, Tony does a quick test of his blood: the palladium he uses to power his chest arc reactor is slowly poisoning his body. After the event, Tony and Happy are leaving when they are approached by a woman who hands Tony a subpoena, summoning him to a Senate Armed Forces Committee hearing. Tony and Happy decide to take a road trip to Washington DC in Tony\'s new Audi R8.The next morning, during the Senate hearing, Tony\'s usual brand of humor becomes the center of attention while completely ignoring the fact that the government has classified the Iron Man armor as a weapon. Colonel Rhodes presents the investigation into the events surrounding Iron Man\'s creation, but Senator Stern, the committee chairman, takes his remarks out of context. With Justin Hammer of Hammer Industries present, Tony gives a rebuttal showing that he is Iron Man and will not part with his armor (likening handing himself over as being tantamount to indentured servitude), and proceeds to hack the committees computers to show that various ""attempts"" at copying Tony\'s suit - from Iran, North Korea, and even Hammer itself - are complete failures: North Korea\'s is top heavy and collapses easily, Iran\'s crashes into the ground and explodes, while Hammer\'s suit turns around 180 degrees at the waist and severs its pilot\'s spine. With his typical swagger, Tony still refuses to turn over the Iron Man armor to the government and walks out of the hearing.Back at home, Tony is on JARVIS analyzing the latest prototypes and developments for the Iron Man suit, and Pepper enters and the two argue about the future of Stark Industries. Tony is telling Pepper that he\'s making more money off the company\'s common stock than he ever did as CEO. He decides he\'s had enough of being the CEO and wants to focus solely on developing Iron Man. He decides to appoint Pepper as the new CEO, leaving her stunned. The next day a lovely notary public enters to have Tony officially sign the company over to Pepper. Tony is undergoing fighting training with Happy and performs an illegal move on him, getting it confused with MMA. The notary\'s name is Natalie Rushman, and he has Happy give her a boxing lesson, and while looking up her bio, Natalie performs a TKO on Happy, using a takedown that shows there\'s a great deal more to her than there appears.Tony heads to Monaco for some much needed R&R. At a reception before the Monaco 500, where Stark Industries is sponsoring a driver and has entered a Formula 1 racer, Tony is greeted by his favorite ""Vanity Fair"" reporter Christine Everheart, who wants Pepper for the cover of the next issue which will introduce her as the new Stark Industries C.E.O. Justin Hammer also happens to be there. They also greet Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk, who wants a panel at the Stark Expo to showcase his latest invention. Tony takes another reading of his blood, finding that the palladium poisoning has increased. Tony decides that he\'s going to be driving the Stark Industries car instead of the driver that was pre-selected.Stark starts the race, but unbeknownst to him, Ivan Vanko has joined one of the race\'s pit crews. Under his jump suit, Vanko wears a harness with two large energy whips powered by the arc reactor he\'d built after his father died. Vanko uses the whips to slice one car in half, cause a massive pileup and ambushes Tony. As Vanko is wrecking havoc on the track, Happy and Pepper rush to deliver the briefcase Happy carries with him to Tony. Vanko uses his electric whips on the Rolls Royce Phantom that Happy and Pepper are in, and after repeated ramming attempts, Pepper finally manages to give Tony the briefcase. Tony activates the case which is a portable version of the Iron Man armor. After a furious battle, Tony is able to defeat Vanko by manually pulling out the Arc Reactor battery that powers his whips, crushing it after he has JARVIS analyze it. The police grab Vanko and take him into custody, the defiant Vanko yelling at Tony ""YOU LOSE!!"". The entire crowd is stunned at what they\'ve just witnessed. Justin Hammer, however, believes that Vanko can be put to better use.Stark gets a private meeting with Vanko in custody. Vanko asks Tony what it feels like to be a dead man and that palladium in the chest is a very painful way to die. Stark tells Vanko that makes two of them.Later, Hammer breaks Vanko out. He slips Vanko a meal consisting of chicken and mashed potatoes along with a note telling him to ""enjoy the potatoes."" Vanko and another prisoner are given uniforms with the same identification. Vanko immediately kills the prisoner as well as a guard on his way out the door, and sets the explosive device contained in the potatoes and as he makes his escape, he\'s bagged by two Hammer operatives and taken away. Hammer knows Vanko needs his resources to outdo Tony, and Vanko obliges. Hammer then hires Vanko to build armored suits based on existing designs. Vanko tells Hammer they are doing everything wrong. He also requests that Hammer retrieve his pet cockatoo from his home in Russia.On the plane back home, Tony and Pepper are watching the aftermath of the events that took place and are watching a rather angry Senator Stern unload his frustrations with Tony on The O\'Reilly Factor. Stern is saying that Tony Stark lied to the Senate Armed Forces Committee, and that he\'s in danger of being arrested on felony perjury charges: Stark had told the Senate that other countries, as well as Hammer Industries, were 20 years away from having anything that remotely resembled Iron Man, however Vanko surprised everyone by making an working copy of the Arc Reactor. Tony presents Pepper with a gourmet meal and is going to tell her the truth, but they have an awkward moment as Pepper knows that something is up and that Tony isn\'t telling her the whole truth.Back home, Tony is using JARVIS to conduct investigations into Ivan Vanko. He finds that Vanko\'s father Anton Vanko was Howard Stark\'s partner and one of the co founders of Stark Industries. Howard Stark found out that Vanko was conspiring to sell weapons to the Soviet Empire and had him arrested for treason and deported to Russia, where he was imprisoned. His son had been seeking revenge against the Stark empire ever since. While sitting in one of his hot rods in his basement, Tony nearly collapses and is discovered by Rhodes who tells him that this isn\'t a good look for him. He shows Rhodey how the palladium is slowly poisoning him. Rhodes also tells him that he\'s been battling with the Pentagon by stopping them from coming to his Malibu house and taking his suits to be used for weaponized purposes.Tony prepares for what he believes will be his last birthday party. He asks Natalie what she would do if this were her last birthday party. Natalie responds that she\'d do whatever she wanted with whoever she wanted to do it with. While at the party, Tony is quite drunk while wearing the Iron Man suit and behaving recklessly with its weaponry. In the background, Pepper and Rhodes are discussing that he\'s gone way off the deep end. Rhodes tells Pepper that he\'s tired of dealing with the Pentagon and the Senate Armed Forces Committee. Rhodes, finally having enough of Tony\'s antics, goes and dons the silver Mark II suit. He then challenges Tony to a fight, where Tony has the in-house DJ play some good background tunes. The battle ends in a stalemate and Rhodey flies off in the Mark II armor, delivering it to military authorities at Edwards Air Force Base. Justin Hammer is later invited to study the suit himself and provides them with advanced weapons to arm it.The next day, Tony is at the famous Los Angeles landmark doughnut shop Randy\'s Doughnuts, sitting in the Iron Man suit atop the famous giant plastered doughnut. Disgraced and hungover, Tony is approached by SHIELD director Nick Fury, who tells Stark that despite the problems he\'s having with the government and his drunken Iron Man antics, which are the least of his worries, Fury has an issue to deal with in the Southwest United States. Tony wonders if Fury and the ""Avengers Initiative"" is real, and Fury reassures Tony that it\'s real, and that he knew Howard Stark very well, in fact Howard was one of the founding members of S.H.I.E.L.D., the agency he works for. They are joined by agent Phil Coulson and Natalie Rushman, whose real name is Natasha Romanoff, a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent planted in Stark Industries to monitor Tony himself. A hungover Tony is stunned at this revelation and fires Natalie/Natasha, but she then tells Tony that it\'s none of his business and that he\'s under investigation from S.H.I.E.L.D. , and she and agent Coulson are there to make sure Tony follows orders and doesn\'t screw up. Fury and Natasha both mention Tony\'s palladium poisoning; Tony replies that he\'s investigated and tested every know element and every permutation of them with no success. Natasha injects Tony with a serum that slows the symptoms of his palladium poisoning significantly, giving him the time to find an alternate element to keep him alive. In the meantime, Tony will be confined to his Malibu home.Fury tells Tony some more detail about Anton Vanko\'s relationship with Howard Stark and provides Tony with a chest of his father\'s old artifacts that can hopefully be used to find a cure for his condition. Tony resists further attempts from S.H.I.E.L.D. interference, but Agent Coulson reassures Tony that he\'s not going anywhere until Tony finds the answers that he\'s seeking about his condition. Reviewing the film reels in the chest, Stark discovers a message from his father that leads him to the original 1974 diorama of the Stark Expo. He retrieves the diorama from his old office, now occupied by Pepper, and tries to reconcile with her. In reality, the diorama is a disguised diagram for the atomic structure of a new element that Howard couldn\'t produce in his time but Tony may be able to with his advanced knowledge and modern technology.Stark performs a radical alteration of his home workshop and hand-builds a small particle accelerator with the aid of his computer system, J.A.R.V.I.S. Stark synthesizes this new element, creating a new triangular chest arc reactor that cures his poisoning and is much more powerful than Stark\'s earlier versions. Just before Tony completes the particle acceleration, Coulson tells him that he\'s free to go and that S.H.I.E.L.D. has reassigned him to another case in New Mexico.At Hammer Industries, Vanko has radically changed the design of Hammer\'s suits: they are now automated drones. Despite what Vanko considers improvements, Hammer is displeased and imprisons Vanko in a small room with two guards while he takes the drones to the Stark Expo.Hammer unveils his new military drones, captained by Rhodes in a heavily-weaponized version of the confiscated Mark II armor. Unfortunately, it is soon discovered that Vanko has pre-programmed the drones, giving himself complete control. He also has control of Rhodes\' new armor, and Stark arrives just as they go on the attack. As Stark battles these remote-controlled enemies and tries to evade Rhodes, Happy Hogan and Romanoff race to Hammer\'s Queens facility to stop Vanko. When they arrive, they fight their way through Hammer\'s security guards; Happy is pleased he took one of them down but is slightly flustered when he sees that Romanoff has taken down at least a half-dozen in short order. Vanko has already departed for the Expo in a new armored suit, an updated version of the harness he used when he attacked Tony in Monaco. Back at the Stark Expo, just as Hammer has finished his presentation, the drones attack the standing-room-only crowd and they begin to flee. Stark and chases after the drones and engages them while Agent Romanoff and Pepper have Justin Hammer arrested for harboring the fugitive Vanko.Natasha is able to give Rhodes control of his armor again so that he and Stark can fight the rest of the drones together. The two armored allies combine their powers and successfully destroy all the drones. Vanko then lands in the area, wearing a greatly updated armored suit with improved plasma energy whips. After a grueling battle, Stark has an idea for he and Rhodes to use a trick from their earlier battle during Stark\'s birthday party, firing their energy repulsors to collide and create the same explosion with Vanko caught in the middle. The maneuver takes Vanko down, but Vanko\'s armor and drones are revealed to have been equipped with self-destruct charges. As they begin to explode, Stark races to save Pepper, rescuing her at the last moment. After landing on a roof she quits her CEO position, and she finally gives Tony a kiss, to which they both find Rhodes sitting a few meters away. Tony finally tells Pepper the truth about his heart, upsetting her greatly. Stark tells Rhodes to leave, but Rhodes then claims he was there first, so they should get their ""own roof"" after Stark tries to defend himself.At a debriefing, Fury informs Stark that while Stark is ""unsuitable"" for the ""Avengers Initiative,"" SHIELD wants Stark as a consultant. Stark agrees on the condition that Senator Stern personally present him and Col. Rhodes with their medals for bravery, however Senator Stern is less than amused when he presents Tony with his medal.In a post-credits scene, SHIELD agent Coulson is seen driving to a remote impact crater in the New Mexico desert. He informs Fury over the phone that they\'ve ""found it""; in the crater is Mjolnir, the hammer of Thor.']"
30,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Thor,800369,"['Thor is a film that takes risks - and they pay off wonderfully. The movie grounds itself in reality while keeping a mythological and fantasy-esqe tone, and it never loses sight of the humanity within the characters, with elevates this above standard superhero fare.', ""The Marvel magic continues with Thor, as they create yet another throrouly enjoyable, fun, action packed and humourous adventure, where we're introduced to a bigger universe extending far beyond Earths realm.What this movie does perfectly is ground the characters, and link them to our reality so that even though we're dealing with the mystical Frost Giants or the humoungous Destroyer, the characters do not appear other worldly or over powered to the existing superheroes.The visuals are captivating, whether it be the splendours of Asgard or the chilly Jotunheim, the CGI is excellent. The story is crisply told, fast paced and simple, taking us across the realms and giving us a background to some really interesting, well written and well portrayed characters.Chris Hemsworth nails the role of Thor with this charm, comic timing and of course good looks. He brings across the carefree, impulsive Thor while also showing a compassionate, gentle side to the character who'd otherwise have been all brawn and no brain.Antony Hopkins is brilliant as ever, playing Odin Allfather with all the gravitas that the ruler of the nine realms should possess. He shows his steely, ruthless side, as well as his soft, wise nature with elan.With Tom Hiddleston Marvel have struck gold when it comes to antagonist. His portrayal of Loki is by far the best negative character in the Marvel universe thus far. The God of mischief oozes charisma and brings out his underlying conflicts to perfection.Natalie Portman and Stellan Skarsgard play important roles in helping Thor in his transformational journey, and we get small bits and pieces of Idris Elba and Jeremy Renners Heimdall and Hawkeye with a hope that they'd play meatier parts in future movies.The action sequences are frequent and fun, there's a lot of humour, especially as Thor adjusts to the ways of the Earth and it keeps you engaged from the start to the end.All in all, this film provides a perfect introduction to other worldly elements to be incorporated later in the MCU while managing to hold its own as a spectacle.It may not be on par with Iron Man when it comes to a deep, rich story line, but it's the closest a movie in the MCU has come so far in touching those grand heights."", ""In the pantheon of Marvel Superheroes, from my vantage point, Thor is a second-tier player. Even amongst non-obsessive comic aficionados, such as myself, Thor doesn't quite have the readership draw or the common familiarity in the public that heroes such as Spider-Man, Batman, Superman, etc., have. However, that doesn't mean that Marvel Studios, the filmmaking wing of the company, feel inclined to give the filmic adaptation of Thor short shrift. The cinematic entry for this character, titled simply Thor, is among the better of the Marvel adaptations of recent years, mixing a good sense of fun, strong acting, and some Shakespearian level drama that makes for an especially entertaining time at the movies.Liberally adapting portions of Thor comic book lore to fit in a more modern comic book film reality, Thor introduces us to a centuries old war between the Asgardians, beings that live for long periods of time and can travel through space from their home realm of Asgard to various other worlds, such as Earth, via the Bi-Frost bridge, and the conflict centric Frost Giants, whom the Asgardians conquered some time back. Odin (Anthony Hopkins), ruler of the Asgardians, is preparing to abdicate his throne to his son, Thor (Chris Hemsworth), but on the eve of Thor's inauguration, agents of the Frost Giants infiltrate Asgard and attempt to steal back a device that is the key to their power, which had been taken by Odin at the end of their long struggle. When Thor disagrees with his father's desire to not to retaliate in order to not disturb the peace that currently exists between the Asgardians and the Frost Giants, he takes matters into his own hands, traveling to the Frost Giant's realm with his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston), and compatriots Sif (Jaimie Alexander), Volstagg (Ray Stevenson), Hogun (Tadanobu Asano) and Fandral (Josh Dallas) in tow. When the encounter with the Frost Giants ends with tensions re-ignited between the two factions, Odin decides that his son is not prepared to lead his people, and exiles Thor, sans his powers, to Earth.When he arrives on Earth, he is discovered by astrophysicist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and her associates Professor Selvig (Stellan Skarsgaard) and Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings), who are convinced that he isn't a random homeless vagabond that they found in the middle of the desert. Thor must attempt to locate his power hammer, Mjolnir, from the government agents that have captured it, and attempt to reclaim his place in Asgard. However, he finds that, without his super-human abilities, and surrounded by humans, perhaps some of his previous attitudes were incorrect, especially when he connects romantically with Jane. Meanwhile, Loki, who turns out to have some ulterior motives, seizes control of Asgard following the collapse of Odin from strain, and begins to hatch a grand scheme involving the Frost Giants.Thor, much like Iron Man before it, proves that, in the right hands, a comic tale that appears silly on the surface can have hidden depths when properly plumbed. Sure, Thor has elements that, on the face of it, may lead a bit to some audience snickers (Thor's ability to pick himself up and fly and defeat attackers with little effort are a bit cheesy at times), but the creatives behind Thor, including director Kenneth Branagh, manage to develop a story for Thor that deals with elements of tragedy, pathos, selflessness and, perhaps even more surprisingly, involving character development. Thor is more about the lead characters at its core, again akin to Iron Man, than some other comic book films and this draws the audience into its tale.When it was first announced that Kenneth Branagh would be taking the reins of Thor as a director, it seemed something of an unusual fit for someone best known for his cinematic adaptations of the works of Shakespeare, but the final results of Thor bare out that Branagh was just the right man for the job. Considering the larger-than-life origins of the Thor comic, involving beings with the power and appearance of Gods and the various machinations of their story, the material fits fairly well with Branagh's body of work to a great extent. Especially strong is the development of Loki, who proves to be less of a traditional mustache twirling villain, and more of a misguided soul, trapped between revelations he makes about himself and his past and his respect in his father, making him more of a tragic figure than a black and white comic book antagonist.Thor benefits from strong acting from its leads, Hemsworth and Hiddleston. Hemsworth embodies Thor, first as the brash, acting-before- thinking hero, and later as a man faced with the reality that some of his choices and attitudes were not becoming of a king. Hemsworth really makes you empathize with Thor, and gives you a reason to root for the character throughout the film. Hiddleston, working with the somewhat subdued (at first) Loki eventually transforms him from a seeming weak, malleable person into one who's penchant for vengeance and control is revealed in layers, peeling back one by one through the development of the narrative.Thor isn't without its weak points, however. The romance between Thor and Jane Foster is practically and afterthought, rushed into the narrative at light speed and then not given any room to breathe or develop, it plays more as a requirement of adapting the comic story than something that works organically in the film. Portman is fine in the role, but the screenplay doesn't give enough to this relationship for it to be more than a bump in the road of the film's story.Once again, Marvel has managed to take one of their lesser known heroes and make them the subject of an entertaining film version, with energy and depth that is a bit unexpected. May they keep on making comic book films of this caliber."", ""Thor was much much better than I expected. I didn't know if they could pull of the balance between the Norse mythology stuff and the real world Marvel Universe. I should've known better because Marvel knows their characters and knows what we want to see. Spider-Man set a new standard for the superhero film genre back in the day. Iron Man upped the ante. Thor takes the ball and runs with it and places that bar even higher. I look forward to seeing it again and know it will do well enough to be worthy of a sequel because word of mouth is going to be great. Trust me when I say Thor REALLY IS as good as Iron Man and is most worthy to be called one of the greatest adaptations ever.Chris Hemsworth as the Norse god Thor, and Tom Hiddleston as his villainous brother Loki show they have the acting ability and star quality to become mega-marquee names in the future. Marvel found two absolute diamonds in the rough. Both actors make a HUGE impression and are wonderful on screen. You knew Acedemy Award winners Anthony Hopkins and Natalie Portman would bring it but these relative unkowns more than hold their own on screen. I know the script is written mostly for them but they carry it in a big way. From what I've read, Hemsworth and Hiddleston were cast almost a year in advance of filming the story so, they had time to get into shape and do character research. They certain did these long-time Marvel greats proud. Intelligent comic-book popcorn epics are rare and this one is definitely a cut above the usual fare."", ""I watched this last night at a preview screening in London.I prayed that Kenneth Branagh would learn from his mistakes with handling a big budget movie, namely his Frankeinstein. Thankfully, I am glad to say he learnt a great deal from those mistakes. Of course, this is no Henry V, this is just pure popcorn entertainment but a thoroughly enjoyable introduction to Thor for the big screen. Chris Hemsworth played the part with a lot of energy, charisma and I have to admit from a bloke's point of view, annoying good looks. Anthony Hopkins added much needed heavyweight presence as Odin but its a role he has quite frankly played a gazillion times but I never tire of it, so I'm not complaining. In a year long span of brilliantly playing vastly different roles from psychotic to swashbuckling heroine, Natalie Portman this time plays the sweet determined scientist girl who falls for the strangely mannered good looking guy. Nothing too taxing for any of them but they do give a re-assuring aura about them.The visuals were quite spectacular, mainly, the sweeping canvas of Asgard. The action scenes were also good though I thought could have been executed better with lesser use of the fast cut edit style that is too often the norm in action film these days.There is plenty of humour when Thor is on Earth but not in a put-off way as there is a suitable contrast of a serious tone with everything set in Asgard. Even though the storyline was somewhat predictable, it was still a riveting one.For those like me, who were concerned about how Thor fits into the established Marvel connected universe set by the Iron Man films need not worry. That is just another thing that Branagh and crew pulls off very well. We can now fully embrace the forthcoming Avengers where a God, a man who transforms into a giant green beast, and a man who flies in a hi tech amour suit can share the same screen. So its all coming together nicely.And make sure you stay for the end credit scenes. In case you did not know of this before, I urge you to go back to the previous films (Iron Man 1 & 2, Incredible Hulk) and watch the end of credit sequences if you haven't already. They tell a separate story strand that will culminate to a certain upcoming Marvel movie. The end credit sequence of Thor is the most fascinating yet as it actually takes a major plot development in the story strand ;) And it was the longest bloody end of credit sequence I've ever seen in any movie! One last thing, the film I saw was in 3d and once again, it practically nearly ruined all the action scenes for me. In the non action scenes, it was pretty useless and just simply made the film much darker."", 'This is a throw-off piece of Marvel fiction that is packed full of cliché and predictability...to a point.I found myself cringing at a lot of the scenes of heroism and there\'s a definite stink of pure cheetos-stained fanboyism in many of the scenes in general, with the usual over-the-top ""glory"" of this old four-color trope.But certain things caught my attention as well-done.First, Asgard is absolutely beautiful. They went all out in making a realm of metallic and elemental grandeur. I had no trouble in buying this as the realm of Asgard, the ultimate land of beautiful heroism. In particular, the rainbow bridge, the weaponry, and the interior scenes were very fitting in general style and specific detail. Very impressive visually and even thematically.Second, Branagh\'s touch can be seen with Shakespearean flair in the family of Odin the AllFather. Odin himself is brimmed with both the rime of age and the wisdom that comes with it and yet his voice can instantly summon fearful authority. Hopkins does well with that balance, even through some cheesy scripting.And the brothers... the sibling rivalry here is very very potent in that it is nuanced and fully realized by both actors. There is love there, but also a lack of understanding, envy, and hate. Loki is far from a cardboard villain, in that we see, all in one package - a fighter who protects his allies, an honest counselor, a liar, a cautious thinker, a smooth tongue, and an awkward one. He loves and reveres his father, but comes to almost fatally doubt him and even hate him...but it\'s all very real and very stirring. And even when it\'s clear that he\'s done very grim deeds, you can actually understand and accept his motives...and his last scene in the film brings all three of the family men together in a very poignant moment of utter loss.I was pretty surprised how moving this all was, especially when put in the middle of some otherwise-uninspiring hero pablem.So in summary, this movie both met my negative expectation of disappointment and surprised me with some purely moving content. See it to see if it surprises you at all as well, and forget the whole comic-book hero thing, since that\'s been done far better.Thanks for reading.', 'Who knew Thor was the perfect drinking buddy and is domesticated lol? Perfect writing. Perfect directing. Perfect casting. Perfect cinematography. Perfect amount of S/VFX. Perfect score. Perfect comedy/drama/thrills. Etc... 10/10', ""Straight to the point, this was not only one of the better ones, its one of the few really good ones. I'm sure anyone reading this knows what i'm getting at, they either get these right or they get them wrong. Well this ones right, very right, from start to finish, epic, spectacular, warm, funny, action packed. The story draws you in, the characters are likable, the pace is just right, doesn't race along, but doesn't plod either. Great cast, particularly Chris Hemsworth, if Captain America and Green Lantern can keep up this standard then it'll be a good summer season.Ken's pulled it all together. Go and watch it, i cant imagine you wont enjoy it and if you think i'm being paid to say this then get stuffed !!"", ""Okay, so Thor is pretty darn decent. Phew. Without revealing anything regarding the plot, I'll just say that I enjoyed this film quite a lot, and would rate it above both Iron Man films, but not by too much. (If you hated them maybe just stay away from Marvel movies in general?) Very good in all areas, without achieving greatness in any sums up this movie nicely I think. Beautiful costumes and set design, solid acting all around, and much better action than recent movies have offered up. The world of Asgard has been handled wonderfully, looking absolutely gorgeous, and with all of its denizens very well spoken without their dialogue ever being as obtuse or clunky as Thor's 'Ye Olde' English has been known to be in the past. Special mention to Idris Elba for being friggin' awesome. I'm a pretty big Marvel fan, but not knowing what Mjolnir is won't harm your enjoyment of Thor to any great degree I don't think. Also, side note, I personally dislike 3D with a great, burning passion (thank you Clash of the Titans), but it is relatively well done here, never distracting from the film. I would still recommend seeing it in 2D if you can though, as it is quite dark in parts. Several parts. Bring on the Avengers!"", ""Honestly, seeing that Branagh directed and J. Michael Straczynski wrote the script is a large part of why I went to see the movie. Plus I'm generally a big fan of Marvel and their movies.Unfortunately it's one of the dumbest things I've seen in years, and is completely full of moronic clichés and the most superficial faux morals. Please do yourself a favour and spend your money on things that are more deserving of it, especially if you've worked hard to earn it.Just in case you want to know what you'll be missing ---* spoiler alert * (though really I'm giving this film a massive compliment by suggesting you could 'spoil' anything in it)Thor's father takes his hammer away and sends him to earth for punishment. While there Thor literally changes overnight from being an arrogant, rash and violent idiot to a wise, humble and pacifist purveyor of all things noble, and the only possible reason for this that's presented in the movie is that he met Natalie Portman and was then told that his father died while he was gone. Once Thor the god of thunder completes this astonishing and instant transformation and sacrifices his life for others, his hammer flies back to him, revives him and he beats the bad guys with it.If you really, really love Marvel movies and viking folklore (to the point where you don't mind these things being made a joke out of) and have 2.5 hours in which you'd otherwise be causing harm to humanity or this planet, go see it. Otherwise you might as well spare yourself from this glorious waste of time and brain cells."", ""Did professionals write this film? Did Antony really read the script or did he just see the figures in the contract? I think Nat and Tony need new agents, because you do not go from Silence of lamb and Black Swan *respectively* to this utter junk.I do not know what other people saw but there is nothing good or unique in this film. The special effects actually made me tired. And lets talk about the story? My Lord, where was it and when did it begin. I got the feeling that the script was written after the action sequences were planned. They therefore said we want this effect and this effect now lets write a film around that. We need to use up Nat so lets force a romance into the script. We want jokes, so lets force a few of those in there. So much dead space in the film that doesn't arch into anything.scenes seem random and disconnected, like writing in junk to get it to a feature length time. drifting focus, drifting priorities. And no great moments that saved the film.Also it is an overnight transformation from utter arrgoance to humility. Does anyone identify with any characters here? Did you understand the brothers motives? Makes no real sense in the real world. Did the film introduce anything for anyone to attach themselves to emotionally? No. Characters appear in odd order without any development. Actually while I am here typing I just realized something : This film is below the dignity of critique. It is so poor, so badly directed and written that to even point out the weak character development or random script turns give too much credit to it. I will therefore cease to add speak about it for fear of giving someone the illusion that there is anything to actually speak about in terms of artistic critique."", ""Plain and simple - when the humans show up the movie dies a slow death.It's a superhero movie so you know what the plot is. Hero comes to Earth to help humans. They're basically riffing Superman to the Nth degree here. But on to the important stuff...What the heck is Natalie Portman doing in this movie. I mean that in two ways. First why is she even in the movie? Second, what did she do other than stand there and let her hair be blown around by the off screen wind machines? It felt like all of her scenes were filmed in one day and she looks so bored in all of them. Chris Hemsworth was fine as Thor and Hopkins played a good Odin, but it was the human characters that kill this one.At least Branagh threw in Skarsgard for the Swede inside joke. But as usual Stellan Skarsgard is totally wasted. After Insomnia I was just in awe of what the man is truly capable of and here in the states they always use him as a window curtain.I didn't mind the first act all that much, but for a movie about the GOD OF THUNDER, it comes off surprisingly meek."", ""The first blockbuster of 2011 may be the best. They certainly set the bar very high. It's an exciting and certainly an all-around entertaining comic book adaptation. Nothing in this genre since LOTR has been any better. Everyone involved in the production should be proud to know that their movie can stand toe-to-toe with the likes of anything else that summer can throw at them.They found the perfect combination of spectacle and guts and passion balanced with the human dynamic of the character. It delivers mind-bending visuals but it still very intelligent and thrilling. How many summer films can you say that about that you've seen over the past ten years or so???? The actors REALLY brought the characters to life. It was really amazing to see it develop on the big screen. There's no doubt that Hemsworth is a star in the making and a rather astounding leading man. Thor is a dazzling example of the superhero movie done right. There were some parts in the movie where I was just blown away. This film has a depth that no one could have expected and is very impressive in scale and design.I love how the movie played out and it exceeded all my expectations. This was by far the adventure movie I've seen in years. Not too many movies continue to have character growth from start to finish but still pack in the action and heart."", ""I'm always a fan of the first films with each character because of the originality. I'm watching them again from the start and Thor is not as good as Iron Man but is still a very good film. The relationship between Thor and Loki is a massive part of the MCU story and is at the forefront of this film, still really good action and continuation of the MCU."", ""Though I'm old and did read some comics in my time, Thor was never one of them. I do teach some Norse mythology, though, so that aspect interested me. There was an odd steampunk approach to the mythology, which was OK, I suppose. I really didn't expect this movie to be War and Peace, and I was certainly right on the money with that. It went for the snarky Iron Man approach more than I thought it would. It's hard to pull off without veteran snarkmeister Robert Downey, Jr., though. Chris Hemsworth is impossibly charming and good- looking in the title role, and does pretty well, considering some of the lines he had to say. Anthony Hopkins is a safe choice for his patented Older Mentor/Authority Figure performance (enjoy that check, Anthony), and Tom Hiddleston is somewhat intriguing as Loki. Stellan Skarsgard is completely wasted in a role that could have been phoned in. But you know who really stinks up the joint? Natalie Portman. It was DAMN hard to believe she was an astrophysicist, but it was even harder to believe that THOR (god of thunder, possessor of unspeakable power) would find her even remotely interesting. All she does is whine. The alleged falling in love is quite unbelievable, BTW. Yeesh. I hope the inevitable sequel loses her character."", 'I\'d never read a Thor comic, nor had I been following this movie\'s progression until a trailer was released, the first of which I didn\'t think was great, but the second of which I thought looked promising. To my surprise, this film turned out to be one of my favourite comic book films ever. The story\'s interesting without being overly convoluted, starting in an unlikely place as we meet astrophysicist, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), who works alongside scientists, Darcy (Kat Dennings) and Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård), and she makes a memorable first impression as she accidentally hits Thor (Chris Hemsworth) with her car (on more than one occasion). He\'s been cast out of Asgard for going against the wishes of his father, Odin (Anthony Hopkins), and picking fights with the Frost Giants. Meanwhile, his devious brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is plotting against him (which Odin *really* should\'ve seen coming, as having two sons and telling them that only \'one\' can be King never ends well).Aussie actor Chris Hemsworth (who did a lot with a little in 2009\'s Star Trek) is easily likeable in the role, not only meeting the physical requirements of a god, but also displaying a comedic side and at the same time proving himself capable of selling the more serious/dramatic moments (there were two scenes which stood out to me. The first being his fight with his father just before he\'s banished, which felt like a very *real* father/son argument, as Thor clearly realizes he\'s gone too far after insulting his dad. The other moment was a particularly emotional one once Thor is delivered some devastating news by his manipulative trickster of a brother whilst being stuck on Earth without his powers. Hemsworth really sells that despite his bravado, Thor is just a son who misses home and cares about his father even when he doesn\'t see eye-to-eye with him. It was a very underrated scene, I felt).I, for one, felt Natalie Portman\'s Jane Foster wasn\'t the typical dull \'love interest\' role that seems to plague a lot of comic book movies. She\'s intelligent and actually has a lighter side than most love interests, thankfully not being dead serious all the time. She\'s ably supported by Skårsgard (this is the first time I\'ve liked him in a role) and Dennings (who steals every scene she\'s in as Darcy, bringing some genuinely amusing humour to the film). While it would have been easy for the scenes set on Earth to feel \'slower\'/more \'boring\' than those set in Asgard, it\'s these three human characters and their interaction with Thor that keeps their scenes interesting/entertaining. There is much humour to be found in the fish-out-of-water situation that Thor finds himself in, the relationship that develops between him and Jane isn\'t over-done and where we leave the two of them at the end of the film wasn\'t quite what I expected.Thor\'s allies back on Asgard prove interesting as well. His friends (referred to at one point as ""Xena, Jackie Chan and Robin Hood"". I\'d add that the fourth looks like a taller version of Gimli from LotR) aren\'t just one-dimensional characters. They\'re actually each unique, bringing something different to the table (I especially enjoyed the moment where they\'re reunited with Thor on Earth and wave to him happily, thus showing they\'re just your typical best friends albeit with godly powers). The one who made the most impression, though, was Lady Sif played by Jaimie Alexander, who kicks just as much ar$e as the \'Warriors Three\' but isn\'t just a \'tough chick\', as she also displays real emotion...especially for Thor, as evidenced by her beaming smile when his powers are fully restored after his self-sacrifice. I found the moment where he looked to have been dealt a fatal blow by a giant metal energy beam-shooting robot called the Destroyer (the noisiest damn thing I\'ve heard at the cinema in a LONG time) emotionally impactful (the music also helped). Anthony Hopkins commands the screen whenever he appears, though spends the latter half out of commission. Loki, meanwhile, I thought was an okay villain. I know he\'s got his fanboys/fangirls, but I personally found his character to be the typical jealous brother with daddy issues and I grew tired of shouty moments. His helmet left a bigger impression on me than he did.What the film excels at is the visuals. Asgard is truly a wonder to behold. There\'s a rainbow bridge, the city looks like a giant golden pipe organ, and the way they travel to Earth is particularly memorable. Then there\'s the fights Thor gets into. Everything from fearsome battles with Frost Giants on Asgard to rough & tumble fist fights in the mud with burly humans on Earth, taking on the Destroyer (despite all odds against him), and finally his inevitable fight against Loki at the end. The film certainly has no shortage of fight scenes, each one well-done/different from the last. When Thor finally regains his powers and once again wields his mighty hammer, Mjölnir (which Darcy hilariously calls \'Mew Mew\'), aka the BEST. WEAPON. EVER...it\'s quite the sight to behold.Kenneth Branagh\'s direction is a large part of what makes this film so good (even if he tends to overuse the \'Dutch angle\' camera shot). The costumes look great and the movie manages to make them, as well as the Frost Giants, not be laughable in appearance. Apart from the look of the film, what also helps it feel epic is the score. The music adds SO much, being majestic/memorable, and I also liked the rockin\' end credits song. Speaking of the end credits, as with previous MCU films, there\'s an extra post-credits scene. For a film I hadn\'t given much thought to, it was a delightful surprise to find myself thoroughly enjoying Thor. It\'s a comic book movie that stands out from a lot that have come before, and is genuinely entertaining on all accounts. I, for one, can\'t wait to see more of ol\' Blondebeard.', 'Alright, back when this was into preproduction, I (and so many comic book fans) were surprised when Branagh was slated to direct. Here we have Thor the god of lightning and his mighty hammer, directed by a man who works mostly around William Shakespeare plays.Thankfully, this helps. A lot.Almost every superhero movie (Marvel, lately) focuses on more action instead of character development. Sure, they may look awesome, but you get used to it. Branagh bravely steers away from this predicament and directs the actors with such skill and flair you may mistake this film for yet another Branagh/Shakespeare costume epic.Make no mistake this is still a superhero film, with some nice special effects and a stylish production design for Asgard, but there\'s a nice human twist to the story - that of dueling brothers, or gods, or god- brothers... you get the idea. Chris Hemsworth looks just about right for the part and shows some charisma as well as the hero. Branagh has assembled an interesting mix of actors - we have the great Anthony Hopkins, the cute Natalie Portman, Stellan Skarsgard, Kat Dennings, Idris Elba and even Rene Russo. Tom Hiddleston however steals the scene as the mischievous brother Loki.Here\'s another good thing about the movie - the story and acting outweigh the special effects and action sequences. For a superhero film, this is extremely rare. Branagh deserves kudos for the effort, however some parts do not gel in nicely and there\'s some action bits that are not too well-filmed.All is forgiven though - ""Thor"" is an above-average superhero movie, not extremely exciting, but definitely intriguing. Fans of both comic book films and costume dramas will certainly enjoy this.Two words of caution - one, keep an eye out for some cameos, both during and after the film. Two, for goodness sake do not watch it in 3D. I saw it in normal 2D and that\'s fine enough by me. I didn\'t see anything worth watching in 3D in it.Overall rating: 68/100', ""Having just seen the global premiere of Thor - God of Thunder, in Sydney Australia, all I can say is ....wow! Don't worry readers I am not about to give away one single spoiler, however after some time and anticipation, Thor is a winner. Australian Chris Hemsworth graced the red carpet in all his native glory, talking up the film and his future entity in The Avengers. He was joined by Shakespeare aficionado Director Kenneth Brangh and co stars Jamie Alexander & Tom Hiddleston who plays crowd favourite Loki. Thor is a good movie, plenty of action, a lovely heroine (Natalie Portman) and some interesting sidekicks. Costumes rock, not to mention the obligatory Marvel characters making significant cameos, not just the extra scene after the credits, but within the film itself. I was a little over superhero movies recently but this is not to be missed."", 'Sorry, to all that have given this ""movie"" more than 1 out of 10. This has to be one of the most sorry excuses for a movie I\'ve ever seen. Actually less interesting and more poorly written than Pokemon the movie and even that was a new low for me... It cost me £10.00 to see this (I had my own 3d glasses)!!! I\'m considering asking for a refund.What was the point of Natalie Portman or the other mortals presence and the 5 minutes we spent in their company?This movie is nothing but a 2 and bit hour long trailer for the undoubted THOR 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 which will have all the drama and normally good content that Marvel based movies have (I can only hope).More time is spent (nearly half) developing characters and giving us background information on how we\'ve got to where we\'ve got...rather than telling the story that we paid to see....There\'s no depth of character, (Anthony Hopkins was the best actor in it and he spent most of his time in a coma, I\'m guessing after he read the script !), there\'s no plot other than arrogant son, exiled to earth. He spends 5 minutes (yes 5 !) not understanding anything that\'s going on or how society works (despite him and his people being deified for at least 2,000 years) and then gets sucked back to his own ""realm"", there\'s little in the way of good dialogue, the special effects are Dr Who\'esq and the 3D is forgettable.There\'s no menace from any of the baddies, his ""bad"" half / non brother seems so nice that you think ""ah it\'s all an act and something terrible is going to happen""... but no, he is quite a nice guy only really dabbles with naughtiness.....This film was supposed to be in 3D yet I completely forgot that it was after the first 5 minutes and only at the end when I realised that I was wearing the stupid glasses did I remember!!In a time where we have transformers, X-Men and the like, the special effects were weak and pretty poor. There\'s no humour no camping it up to rescue it either.My worry is that if this is the best movie of the undoubted quadruology that we\'re about to be subjected to, then God help us. I warn you we may have another Iron Man 2 (a movie I still haven\'t been able to stay awake all the way through yet!!) or Spiderman (anything other than 1) on our hands and can I bring myself to part with another £10 on the strength of that?... almost certainly not.This could and should have been great, it wasn\'t and I\'m left feeling cheated ! Cre8.', ""I have to admit, i had low expectations for this adaptation. Hulk yeah sure, Iron man, why not, Captain America, its set in the real word of course it'll work. But THOR? A wildly fantastical tale of Norse Gods and Rainbow bridges and nicknamed hammers ?? Surely not! Ill stop with the bashing; this film is astonishing. The oddest thing has happened here. Coupling notoriously artsy director Kenneth Branagh with one of Marvels most theatrical characters was a stroke of genius. At the beginning of the film, we are quickly introduced to Jane Foster, her whimsical offsider and an older gentleman. Storm chasers aren't normally this clever you might think to yourself during this opening scene, but alas, they are revealed to actually be physicists after a few minutes. An incredible storm arrives and THOR HAS LANDED: or so you would think. Mere moments after being introduced to our title character we are thrust on an astrological journey to Asgard, land of gods. Here we are introduced to Odin, the all father and his 2 young boys; Loki and Thor. Odin recites stories of an ancient war in which a planet load of frost giants planned to destroy the realm of Midgard (earth) before Odin and his merry men stepped in to save humanity. It is during this scene we are first shown Thor's arrogance and thirst for war. Skip ahead a few years and THOR has become Asgard's mightiest warrior, just as Odin had foretold. A celebration is occurring, Thor is about to be crowned as king of Asgard, but alas... this glorious day is interrupted by none other than said FrostGiants attempting to steal a stolen heirloom from Asgard's weapons locker.. The story rapidly gains traction from here. Thor marches into the Frost Giants planet (against his fathers will) in all his Aussie glory, kicking ass and taking names. He and his friends become swiftly over powered and Odin is left no choice but to step in. An argument erupts in which Odin tells Thor of his assholness and douchebaggery and that he is no longer worthy of his giant hammer Mjolnir or his god of Thunder status. Cast down to Earth the audience is reunited with the opening scene and we are officially filled in. A bevy of comedic scenes follow in which Chris hemsworth's THOR is tranquillised and run over multiple times. The film transitions backwards and forwards between our world and that of Asgard so as to keep us informed on going ons. Odin goes into a coma and Thor's mischievous bro Loki starts to come into his own. A marvellous story unfolds filled with action, humour, heartache and a whole heap of awesome!! Branagh's eye for curious shots is on full show here and works fabulously in creating a beautifully surreal Asgard. The films close is a little rushed but is also very heartfelt and strong. Leaving plenty of room for more character development, THOR is as good as if not better than every comic film to date, the characters were superbly cast and played and the story follows as close as it can to the source material as it can without being too over the top. Spectacularly fun movie, worthy of the Marvel name tag and certainly a sequel. 10 out of 10 for performance and entertainment....Make sure to stay after the credits for the Captain America nod."", 'In 965 D.C., in Tornsberg, Norway, the Frost Giants from Jotunheim led by King Laufey (Colm Feore) attack the locals, and the Allfather Odin (Anthony Hopkins) and the warriors of Asgard protect the humans and win the battle against the invaders. They take their source of power and bring it to Asgard and they start an armistice with Jotunheim. When three Frost Giants break in Asgard trying to retrieve their source of power, they are destroyed by the Destroyer. The arrogant Thor (Chris Hemsworth) decides to attack Jotunheim with his stepbrother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and four Asgardian warriors and disobeys the order of his father Odin. In order to avoid war against Jotunheim, Odin removes the powers of Thor and exiles him on Earth to live among the humans. Odin also throws his hammer Mjölnir to New Mexico and orders that only the one that is worth will get the powerful hammer and achieve Thor\'s powers. In Puente Antigo, New Mexico, the physician Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) is researching a phenomenon in the desert with her professor Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård) and her mate Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings). Out of the blue, Thor is hit by Jane\'s truck and she takes him to the hospital. Thor unsuccessfully tries to retrieve Mjölnir that is protected by agents of the government SHIELD. When the Machiavellian Loki sends the Destroyer to Earth to kill Thor, he needs to retrieve his hammer to save not only the humans, but also his Allfather Odin and Asgard from the evil Loki.""Thor"" is an entertaining adventure based on the character of the comic book published by Marvel Comics. Natalie Portman is usually the synonym of a good movie and she is delightful in the role of a scientist. The plot is funny and the scenes with the human Thor; the Nordic black gatekeeper Heimdall (Idris Elba); and the Vikings and Gods speaking in English are hilarious. The special effects are top-notch and the viewer may bring the popcorn and delight with a pleasant family entertainment. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Thor""', 'Another outstanding effort, Marvel does it again! It\'s hard to believe that a movie with this subject matter can make you think and challenge all your movie viewing skills but it does so and more. It\'s very artistic and you would expect no less from Kenneth Branagh. He presents the entire film in a way that can be savored. Many aspects are classical drama and yet other aspects are just plain old fun kick-butt action scenes. It\'s a perfect blend and this movie is far deeper then I would\'ve thought. The pacing was perfect as is the link to the Marvel movie Universe... I can\'t wait to see what Captain America brings us. Overall, a summer movie that\'s superior to everything else that I\'ve seen in years.The director\'s background in Shakespearian themes comes in to play right from the beginning of the film and run throughout. Thor is a super-strong ""god"" and can travel through space with supernatural powers yet the story is paradoxical and contrary about those elements instead choosing to focus on the human elements. THAT elevates this film far beyond anything I was expecting but I should have known better considering the source material and the director.The genuine and relatable qualities of these characters are what make it a great film. Sure, the action and fantasy are incredible but the story works so well. The family dynamics between fathers & sons along with sibling rivalry and the price of vanity and lack of humility all resonate. The choices made and the relationships on display are as wonderful as the brawling and action... which are as good as any summer movie that I\'ve seen in years.', ""This film was one of the most tedious experiences of my life. I enjoy a good cheesy action film like the next guy and was genuinely looking forward to a mindless 90 minutes of fun. What I actually experienced was self important, overly buff, lord of the rings reject extras spouting some of the worst lines in film history. How Natalie Portman, let alone Stellen Skarsgard, got roped into this I will never know. Repetitive actions scenes, awful editing that cut the middle of conversations and light humour from Thors friends (puke) and the terrible Kat Dennings made for a challenging viewing experience all round. Where Iron Man went so right with its self depricating humour and quick wit Thor has languid scenes, flacid romance and wooden character interaction.The picture lacks a decent development of storyline and character which is always difficult when introducing a character with a deep backstory but it has been done so well recently with Batman Begins et al. There is a definite smell of studio meddling in the final cut with some scenes jumping all over the place. Loki (Tom Hiddleson) changes from loyal brother/Son to evil traitor with no story or character development. Anthony Hopkins spends most of the film in a coma. Chris Hemsworth can't be to blame for a film which seems over produced, over edited and that was marketed as Return of the King but was more Masters of the Universe. The decision to assign 'Ice Giants' (yes Ice Giants) as 'baddies' falls flat as they are about as scary and menacing as frosty the snowman.The whole project felt a thin and is so poorly put together you could see it unravel before your eyes. Fingers crossed for a better Summer Blockbuster in the near future..."", 'Wow. That was the first thing I thought after seeing Thor. I\'d read the strong reviews, I loved the choice of Kenneth Branagh as director and the trailers looked great. But I still wasn\'t prepared for how satisfying this movie would be. This is the very definition of epic, and I LOVED it.Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is a God of Norse mythology, son of Odin (Anthony Hopkins) and brother of Loki (Tom Hiddleston). When Thor disobeys his father and sparks an ancient war with the Frost Giants, Odin banishes him from the realm of Asgard and casts him down to Earth. With the help of a trio of humans (including Natalie Portman\'s Jane), Thor struggles to fit in on Earth whilst looking for a way to return to Asgard. Meanwhile, the devious Loki plots for his father\'s throne\x85Simply put, Thor is the best superhero movie since The Dark Knight. The idea of Norse gods and warriors who dress, sound and look like pompous Vikings (some of whom interact with modern humans), multiple universes, rainbow bridges and Frost Giants must have seemed pretty hard to pull off without being silly, especially when this hero eventually has to meet with more ""realistic"" superheroes such as Iron Man, Hulk and Captain America in next year\'s The Avengers movie. But Branagh has taken something potentially camp and cheesy and turned it into a powerful, strangely relatable story; there are quite a few Shakespearian elements in Thor\'s story, something which Branagh is an undeniable master at adapting to the screen. Plus, Branagh and the screenwriters also inject a much-needed humour into the proceedings without unbalancing the emotion and surprising seriousness of the story. The most impressive thing about Thor is the way it treads a pitch-perfect line between respecting the material and winking at its audience knowingly (most notably with a certain cameo). In that way, it\'s reminiscent of The Mask of Zorro, never taking itself too seriously whilst never allowing itself to slip into parody. Branagh also proves to be a master at creating an epic summer blockbuster. Apart from a few dodgy moments, the visual effects are stunning; in fact, this is probably the most visually impressive film I have seen from Marvel thus far. The production design is also beautiful; Asgard is one of the most incredible movie landscapes I have ever seen. My eyes were stretched to breaking point, trying to drink in all the details of this new, exciting and opulent world. There are some moments which look a bit fake (which is annoying when the filmmakers had about $150 million to work with), but it\'s almost forgivable based on how spectacular the majority of the visual FX shots are. Credit must go to the FX and art direction departments. But a summer blockbuster wouldn\'t be a summer blockbuster without action, and Thor delivers some great sequences. The early encounters with the Frost Giants (genuinely frightening creatures) are superb, with Thor and his friends using some pretty bad-ass moves. A later scene where Thor fights to retrieve his mystical hammer, Mjolnir, is gritty and intense, whilst another great set-piece sees the metallic being known as The Destroyer hunting Thor and destroying most of a desert town in the process. I have heard that many people consider the final confrontation to be anti-climactic, but I have to say that it isn\'t as much about seeing epic action is it is about seeing how the main characters have grown and changed throughout the course of the film. In a way, I think that displays the film\'s greatest strength. It isn\'t all about the action and the visual effects; it\'s more about the characters and the emotional response.Speaking of which, the cast is exceptional. No pay cheque grabbing here; every cast member dives into their role headfirst. Let\'s start with the big guy himself, Thor. Hemsworth is best known for his brilliant, five- minute appearance as Kirk Sr. in 2009\'s Star Trek; to go from that to the lead in arguably one of Marvel\'s most risky undertakings could be seen as a huge step. You wouldn\'t know it from watching Hemsworth\'s performance, though. He is absolutely perfect in the role, charting Thor\'s journey from an impetuous fighter to a more understanding, wiser man with ease. Comedy, action, drama, romance; all encompassed perfectly in Hemsworth\'s performance. He deserves to achieve stardom after this, and I\'m really looking forward to seeing how he fits into The Avengers. Natalie Portman is charming and charismatic as Jane; the scenes between her and Hemsworth ooze chemistry, whilst her scenes with Stellan Skarsgard and Kat Dennings, terrific as Jane\'s mentor and intern respectively, shine with a wonderful camaraderie. Hiddleston steals the movie whenever he appears as the slithering, manipulative yet oddly sympathetic Loki; this is a wonderfully complex role, and Hiddleston never strikes a wrong note. Hopkins, instead of hamming it up, brings powerful gravitas to Odin; he is intimidating, yet wise and weary from his many years of experience. The scenes between him, Hemsworth and Hiddleston are tremendous, each actor bringing all of their talent to bear and succeeding beyond all expectations. There are too many other names to mention, but rest assured everyone\'s sublime.Apart from some minor quibbles, I absolutely loved this movie. Branagh, the cast and crew have succeeded beyond my wildest dreams. This encompasses everything I want from an epic adventure; action, wonder, romance, comedy and a surprising amount of character and intelligence. In my opinion, this is one of Marvel\'s best, taking something which could have sunk to the lows of Ghost Rider or Elektra and propelling it to the same heights as Spider-Man 1 & 2, X2 and Iron Man. Add a great pre-credits teaser for The Avengers (plus one exciting appearance from a minor member), and I couldn\'t be more hyped. You\'re up next, Captain America; don\'t you dare let the team down.', ""When I heard they were making a movie of the character Thor I had serious trepidations. When I heard that Kenneth Branagh was directing it I had even more trepidation not due to the fact that it was Branagh but the fact that all he's ever directed was drama's.Going into the theater I very low expectations from this film and man was I blown away. I like the fact that Branagh didn't approach the story as a super-hero film but more of a Shakespearing epic. The fantasy elements alone were marvelous.Anthony Hopkins IS Odin...I cannot imaging another actor portraying him. His performance as Odin captures the essence of the character and the delicate balance of ruler verses father. He exudes power with subtle touches of vulnerability.Chris Hemsworth is outstanding as Thor. He's got such a likability about him that even at Thor's most arrogant point in the story you can see how his friends stand by him. His performance is rock solid and extremely enjoyable. Tom Hiddleston is THE perfect Loki. He's captured the sleazy, slimy, be nice to your face but looking for a place to drive the knife in your back nature of the character.As I had stated earlier the story plays out as more of a fantasy epic than a dyed in the wool super-hero story. The journey into Jotenheim was stunning and Asgard itself was just beautiful to behold. The set designs were excellent. The humor in the film was very organic and never seemed forced. The story itself was very well balanced and didn't leave you wondering what the heck was going on. I almost wish they'd have kept it separate from the upcoming Marvel films. It works very well as a stand alone epic.The effect's that I was expecting to be sub-standard were in fact top notch and even Thors trademark spinning hammer from the comics didn't look as cheesy as it could have. This movie is a gem. All parties involved should be proud of themselves for bringing such a great piece of work to the screen. I for one cannot wait to see a sequel to this film. With any luck we'll see some of the other nine realms such as Muspelheim, Alfheim or even Vanaheim.This is definitely a MUST SEE film"", 'Three scientists, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård), and Darcy Lewis (Kat Dennings), are in the New Mexico desert in a four-wheel drive van studying an aurora-borealis-type phenomenon. Suddenly a large tornado/lightning storm develops and they drive towards it. The van hits a man inside the maelstrom and they stop. The man, a well-built & handsome blond, is semi-conscious.A voice-over describes a battle in 900 AD between the Jötuns, the frost giants of Jötunheim, and Asgardians; the Asgardians win, seize the power casket, and return to their realm. The speaker is Odin (Anthony Hopkins) talking to his two sons, one the energetic blond Thor, the other a more thoughtful dark-haired boy named Loki. Odin says both of them are worthy but only one can be king.Years later Asgard is having an elaborate ceremony. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is now being formally recognized as the crown prince of Asgard. Loki (Tom Hiddleston) looks on enviously. Before Odin can make the proclamation, alarms go off; there are intruders in the secure rooms that hold the Jotens\' power casket. A large Destroyer robot kills the intruders and saves the power casket. Examining the remains, Odin seems unperturbed, yet Thor is angry and wants to attack. Odin forbids him.Thor gathers Loki and his close friends, Volstagg (Ray Stevenson), Fandral (Josh Dallas), Hogun (Tadanobu Asano), and Sif (Jaimie Alexander), and they ride out to the Bifrost Bridge portal. The guardian, Heimdall (Idris Elba), allows them to pass and the six are transported to the frost giant planet, Jötunheim, a frozen, crumbling wasteland. Suddenly they are confronted by King Laufey (Colm Feore), who taunts the Asgardian heroes. More frost giants surround the six and a battle starts. Loki survives with some magic and has an unusual reaction when he is touched by a frost giant. Laufey releases a huge beast and the Asgardians run for their lives. Thor kills the beast but once again the team are surrounded and things look desperate. Odin arrives to save the day; he apologizes to Laufey for the intrusion and attempts to reinstate peace, but Laufey states that they are beyond diplomacy, that the Frost Giants are now at war with Asgard. He attempts to stab Odin, who blasts Laufey back and takes the young group home.Back at the Asgard side of the portal, Odin lets the four friends go and confronts Thor and Loki. Odin is furious that Thor has dragged Asgard back into war, and tells Thor he is not fit to be king. He strips him of his power, banishes him to Earth and sends his hammer, Mjolnir, after him a few seconds later, saying that whosoever wields the hammer, and is worthy of it, shall have the power of Thor.Earth: Thor gets a little aggressive and Darcy tazes him, knocking him out. The three scientists load him into their van and take him to the hospital. Once again he starts fighting as he wakes up and he\'s eventually tranquilized. Erik tries to get Jane to leave him be, saying he is some kind of nut, but she is curious, and attracted to him. They go back to the hospital but Thor has escaped. As they drive off in the van, they hit the Asgardian man again and knock him out but this time they take him with them. Jane gives him civilian clothes that belonged to her ex-boyfriend. After overhearing locals discussing a satellite crash 50 miles due west, Thor decides to go there and once again Erik tries to get Jane to leave him alone. Thor walks about the town and tries to get a horse in a pet store. Jane appears and gives him a ride; the two head west in the van.At the satellite crash site -- actually the place where Thor\'s hammer came to earth -- a crowd has gathered; people are partying and trying to lift the hammer from the crater. Stan Lee cameos as one of the locals trying to pull the hammer out with his pickup truck. Government agents from SHIELD take over the site and confiscate Jane\'s research notes and computers. After dark, Jane and Thor arrive on the scene. Now the crater is surrounded by guards and tenting. Thor attacks and Jane huddles in safety. After beating up several agents, Thor finally reaches the hammer, but is unable to lift it. He howls at his powerlessness and slumps to the ground, putting up no fight as SHIELD agents close in and take him.Asgard: Thor\'s four friends begin to suspect Loki had something to do with Thor\'s banishment. Loki realizes he is not a pure Asgardian and Odin admits Loki was taken from Jötunheim as an infant and raised as his own. Loki is confused and angry as Odin falls into a coma (""Odinsleep""). Loki becomes acting king.Earth: Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg) questions Thor, and when he leaves him alone briefly, Loki appears in the room. Loki tells Thor that Odin is dead and he cannot come back to Asgard. Thor is distraught. Erik arrives to tell the SHIELD agents Thor is Jane\'s ex-husband and is under the influence of steroids. Somehow he has faked a driver\'s license. Coulson lets Erik take Thor, who surreptitiously grabs Jane\'s notebook on the way out. Back in town Erik takes Thor out for a drink; the two chug boilermakers and bond. Thor brings the drunk Erik to Jane\'s trailer. Thor and Jane go to a rooftop to gaze at the stars, and Thor explains the nine realms and the Bifrost Bridge to Jane. Jane figures the bridge is the theoretical Einstein-Rosen Bridge wormhole.Asgard: Loki freezes Heimdall, then meets Laufey. It was Loki who let the frost giants into Asgard to try to retrieve the power casket earlier. He makes a deal with Laufey that he will let them into Asgard again to kill Odin and have their casket, and in return they will go home in peace. Loki commands the Destroyer to go to Earth and kill Thor.Earth: The Destroyer arrives in the New Mexico desert and starts blasting everything with a heat ray. Thor and the three scientists attempt to get everyone away safely. Thor confronts the Destroyer and asks Loki to leave the humans alone in return for himself. Loki can see and hear what is going on from Asgard. The Destroyer gives Thor a vicious backhand slap and sends him tumbling, apparently dead. Jane runs to the body in tears. However, Thor\'s selfless act of protecting his friends proves him worthy to once again wield Mjolnir, which frees itself from the crater and returns to Thor\'s hand. He is restored to full life and vigor and once again fitted in his red cape and armor. He easily defeats the Destroyer and tries to return to Asgard, promising Jane he will return.Asgard: the frost giants invade through the portal, walking past the frozen Heimdall. Laufey goes to Odin\'s bed chamber and, as he prepares to kill the Norse god, Loki kills Laufey to appear to be the hero. Although frozen, Heimdall is conscious and manages to break free. He brings Thor back to Asgard. Thor flies quickly to fight the frost giants.Loki goes to the Bifrost Portal and sets it up to destroy the ice planet Jötunheim. Thor tries to stop him and the two engage in combat. Thor immobilizes Loki with Mjolnir and starts to destroy the portal to stop the process, smashing away at the bridge itself. As everything crumbles, the two brothers fall into space but Odin is there to hold Thor, who holds Loki\'s staff. Loki admits defeat and allows himself to fall off the disappearing Bifrost Bridge, into the abyss of no return.All seems back to normal on Asgard, although Odin is sad about how it turned out. Thor pines for Jane but Heimdall assures him that she is looking for him. Back on Earth Jane is in a new lab with new equipment.Post-credits, Selvig has been taken to a SHIELD facility where he meets Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). Fury shows him an object in a briefcase, which he says could be a source of unlimited power. Loki appears then, invisible to Selvig and Fury, and says ""Well, I guess that\'s worth a look,"" which Selvig repeats.']"
31,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Captain America: The First Avenger,458339,"['Yes, another high-production, superhero movie invades the theatres. Should you watch it?Captain America: The First Avenger is an action-adventure movie that shows us the transformation of one Steve Rogers from a scrawny but patriotic man during World War II to Captain America, the star-spangled icon of freedom. Equipped with the Super-Soldier serum and his desire to do good, he finds the strength to combat Hydra, a Nazi offshoot, and its deranged leader, Johann Schmidt.To a great extent, the First Avenger succeeds in translating the essence of its title character to the big screen. Captain America is portrayed as a humble guy who just wants to serve his country, so much so that he goes to great lengths to do it. Although there are minor changes to his comic book origin, who Captain America is is preserved. Steve Rogers may have said that he\'s ""just a kid from Brooklyn,"" but he is definitely so much more than that. He is the hero whom people look up to, and whom superheroes aspire to be. Captain America may not have the coolest powers but is relatable in so many levels.It is becoming a trend in movies today to have a complicated plot in order to tell a good story. However, the First Avenger\'s approach, which centers on Captain America fighting the good fight, is pretty straightforward. The film proves that you don\'t need gazillion mind-boggling things to tell an inspiring tale of an extraordinary soldier on the frontlines. Being a superhero movie set in a war zone, it offers a healthy dose of action and involves Captain America bashing enemy heads and throwing his signature shield more times than you can count. Scenes of romance and humor help the film to become balanced and entertaining to watch. Steve is also a nice break from the morally conflicted heroes we usually encounter. He is simply someone who is moved to do what is right—nothing more, nothing less.Aside from the excellent character development and story progression, the film also boasts a solid cast. I honestly had doubts about Chris Evans playing the captain because he was such a fit for the cocky yet strong-willed Johnny Storm aka the Human Torch in the Fantastic Four movies, but he gives a convincing performance. Hugo Weaving as the menace Red Skull doesn\'t disappoint either, although we are still sure to remember him best as Agent Smith in the Matrix trilogy. Hayley Atwell\'s portrayal of Peggy Carter has a sense of both hardiness and elegance which makes the character easy to love. As someone who consistently follows Captain America\'s exploits in comic books, my admiration for the character has increased even more because of the First Avenger. The film gives fans everywhere a good show. I especially liked that they were able to incorporate the printing of a Captain America comic book in a world where he really exists. The punching of ""Hitler"" in the face never gets old!During the course of Captain America: The First Avenger, viewers are shown how to be a patriot through Cap\'s positive demeanor and outlook. In the end, we come to realize that the film deals with fighting for the things we love – freedom, country, friend and even one\'s own potential to do great things. The ending of the film may have been a bit abrupt, but it definitely points to a sequel. In this case, The Avengers (2012) is just around the corner, and it is something that we should watch if we want more of our Captain America.Yes, another high-production, superhero movie invades the theatres. Should you watch it?Of course. There is no other option.', 'I loved this movie. Captain America has had 3 movies in the past, not counting some 1940s ones which can be excused for being good, that were so awful they make movies like Steel or Green Lantern look good. However, I saw a lot of critiques for this movie that were negative. Now I understand differing opinions and all, but they all followed a formula and each one seemed like griping to the point it was just getting stupid. If you\'ll indulge me here, I have a list of the repeated ones and a rebuttal to each.1. The technology for WWII is too far advanced! This one was the most common and the stupidest in my opinion. It\'s called ""Fiction"", as in ""not real"". Every time I heard this one it made me think these people have no suspension of disbelief and would complain that Iron Man is a terrible movie because the technology to build a flying robot suit doesn\'t exist yet. People, it\'s comic books and it\'s in a fictional WWII setting. It\'s allowed to take liberties.2. Captain America is too invincible! That was just stupid. Captain America is relatively weak compared to many other superheroes, he\'s just a perfect example of a human being brought about by the experiments in the film. Also, he\'s the main character. He\'s not supposed to die in a movie that is leading him up to be in a tie-in to all the other recent Marvel films that will lead to The Avengers.3. Red Skull is a terrible villain.There is no sense to this one. He\'s supposed to be the guy that\'s worse than Hitler and can get just as many people on his side to do his bidding. On top of that he can take Cap in a fight fairly evenly. Saying he\'s a bad villain is baseless.4. Steve doesn\'t go through a character arc/get any back-story.For one, he really doesn\'t need to. Steve was a good guy from the start, and he did go through an arc. It was subtle, but he did. He gained more confidence and become the soldier he is. He has a back-story but it\'s weaved in throughout. We know he was bullied a lot, we know he he is from a military family, we know he grew up with Bucky, we know he has had very few, if any, dates in his life, he\'s a childhood friend of Bucky, and we know he wants to be a soldier because he feels its his duty. I\'d rather get it weaved in through the narrative of the story rather than get a huge text dump or just have characters talking for half an hour about everything they\'ve ever done.5. This movie just glorifies America! Not really. It\'s a good vs. evil story that happens to have a character named Captain America, which was given to him by a publicity stunt. I suppose you also hate movies like Saving Private Ryan because it tells things from the perspective of American soldiers but not the Japanese ones? These were the most common arguments and they are easily refutable. Captain America is a great movie, showcasing one of the best Marvel has to offer and should be in the 7s or higher, not the 6s.', ""It wasn't that bad of a movie, but undoubtedly it had a few flaws in terms of screenplay. The story itself was fine, and I'm personally a big fan of Captain America's origin story so this movie was a nice watch for me. Maybe not so much if you don't care at all about superheroes such as CA."", 'Like many comic-book fans I was expecting the worst from this movie. This is not because the character has any less depth than other super-heroes, but I knew that it would be extremely difficult to transition Steve Rogers to film in a serviceable way. The guy is called ""Captain America"" for heaven\'s sake.Any comic-book reader would probably appreciate the ironies and idiosyncrasies behind such ostentatiously patriotic code-name, mostly because in print Cap has challenged the assumptions behind his symbolism, becoming a more conflicted and universal figure.But its hard to translate any of this idiosyncrasy successfully in 2 hours. Fortunately the film, instead of getting to political, is more old-fashioned pulp like Indy or ""Sky Captain,"" which thankfully never takes itself too seriously (which was one of the flaws of ""Thor"").I had my doubts that Chris Evans could pull off the modesty and heart needed for the role, but I was wrong. As the Red Skull, Hugo Weaving was wonderfully evil in a nostalgic, serial-villain kind of way. Haley Atwell is a sidekick/love-interest with the rare quality of not being incredibly annoying, and Tommy Lee Jones is perfectly cast as Tommy Lee Jones.The reason I found this to be a good movie was because I enjoyed it, plain and simple. It\'s well-photographed and well-acted. Like its titular hero, it modestly embraced its silliness, creating a charming B-movie experience.', ""One of the reasons i went into the cinema to watch Captain America is that i wanted to watch the last hero that completes the run of The Avengers next year. I came out the cinema more than pleased.To begin with, i thought Chris Evans perfected the role of J Storm/Human Torch in the Fantastic Four, leaving him to be named after that character as he played it well. I thought he fitted the character. But i was certainly wrong- because he was the more Captain America material. He portrays a character, very convincingly, of a warm, courageous man with a big heart that is worth idolizing as a hero. Steve Roger/Captain America is a man that values friendship and though he may be lost in the love world, that doesn't make him a man without feeling. One scene in particular that showed his bravery was the fake grenade, where he held it to himself in an attempt to save from explosion. Besides, Chris Evans managed to capture my attention, unlike Ryan R in Green Lantern, with his comical scenes. It has been a while i last laughed this loud- and the entire cinema too, watching Captain America. If Chris Evans comes to mind, it's Captain America he made proud of!Watching the trailers, i didn't expect much. And i thought all i was brought into was an action, Marvel movie. It was more to that. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. It has the ideal blend of comedy, action and heart, a combination i find difficult to bring out for its true essence. The movie was fresh, original to a certain extend that what i thought wasn't what i watched. In every typical hero movie, the hero saves the civilian and in here, when he was chasing after the villain and a child was thrown into the river, i thought 'He will go save the kid, and the villain runs away'. But like i said, this is not the ordinary movie, the following scene was truly unpredictable and hilarious. In another scene, where he kisses his love, i least expected the line by Colonel Phillips (by Tommy Lee Jones). The cinema rocked with laughter!The acting by its cast are surely to be credits and the scripts written are worth quoting. Unlike in Transformers when the joke is made in passing, i was entertained in this. I was absorbed into the movie, feeling my character as Steve Roger, or his buddy, or anybody. While i enjoyed Captain America's side of the story, i don't really feel the bad-ness in the villain. In that part, it was average. I thought the villain could be developed further, making him more evil. If there is something i wanted more, it was the end. But then, it is already 2 hours- and any longer might drag the show. And as i have said, i watched what i least expected. I thought it will end with Peggy Carter (by Hayley Atwell) at the bar, dressed to kill, waiting for Steve Roger in his top suit.Then, this is the final build up to The Avengers.No doubt, Marvel skyrocketed another comic-movie adaptation on screen. With the right cast- Chris Evans and the others, and heartfelt moments with sprinkles of unpredictable comical scenes, Captain America proves to deliver far beyond expectation. I never thought i would be talking much on Captain America, but here i am with a full-fledged review on its successful impact on me."", 'Hard to believe that just three years ago (2008), Marvel made the bold decision to create a single movie universe out of their second-tier heroes (though some may argue that Iron Man is first-tier; IMO, that honor really belongs to Spider-Man and the Fantastic Four...but that\'s an argument for another time) that would allow them to finally bring The Avengers to the big screen. This plan got off to a hugely successful start with 2008\'s IRON MAN (9/10) and a decent reboot of THE INCREDIBLE HULK (7/10) later that same year, and started picking up steam when 2010\'s IRON MAN 2 (8/10) brought War Machine and Black Widow into the picture. This year, THOR (7/10) ushered in a good start to the summer movie season and introduced the malevolently mischievous Loki to the mix while giving us a sneak peek at Hawkeye. Now, Captain America finally gets his chance to shine. How does he do?Rejoice, Marvelites, for Marvel Studios has done it again...taken a hero whose origins would be difficult to get right on film and managed to make it look easy. Chris Evans, whose first foray into Marvel movies was playing Johnny Storm (the Human Torch) in the merely O.K. FANTASTIC FOUR, is amazing as Steve Rogers, the 90-lb. weakling who gets transformed into a Super Soldier and becomes the much-beloved Captain America. Evans never lets us forget that Cap\'s real strength has always been his good heart and his love for his country, and that overarching goodness and patriotism are perfectly blended together in this pastiche of 40\'s nostalgia mixed with WWII heroism and just a touch of steampunk (relax, it works here).The plot, if you\'ve read any reviews, you already know, so I won\'t rehash it here. Instead, I\'ll touch on how much I really enjoyed every moment in this movie; the scenes are perfectly put together, all the set pieces move the action forward (even the cheesy USO show montage), and the pace never drags, even in the slower, more personal sections. I do wish a little more work had gone into making the villainous Red Skull (the always-great Hugo Weaving, who could make reading a phonebook interesting) a more compelling villain to watch; yes, Weaving does great work with what he\'s been given, but he could have been so much better. HYDRA never really feels like a true threat because of the way Cap and his men handle them so easily, and that\'s too bad, because a real menacing presence is the one thing this movie really needed to go beyond ""Entertaining"".The supporting players, though, all do great work in making this universe feel real and alive. Hayley Atwell as British Intelligence Agent Peggy Carter, Cap\'s budding love interest, is great, and their interactions are surprisingly touching. Dominic Cooper plays millionaire inventor Howard Stark with a mixture of charm and intensity (and more than a little touch of Robert Downey Jr.\'s mannerisms--watch for the moment when Stark peers over the top of his glasses in a very Downey-esque manner) that provides a nice foreshadowing of his importance in later Marvel lore (as a founder of S.H.I.E.L.D. and the father of Iron Man Tony Stark)--plus seeing an early version of Stark Industries\' logo on every piece of tech is too cool for words. Tommy Lee Jones was born to play an Army hard-nose, and he doesn\'t disappoint as Rogers\' commanding officer Colonel Chester Phillips.The movie, though, ultimately hinges on Evans\' ability to pull off the earnestly intense Captain America, and he does it brilliantly. Even the moment where Cap makes what he believes will be the Ultimate Sacrifice (and if you know your Captain America lore, you know EXACTLY what that sacrifice is and how he\'s going to do it) never becomes cheesy or overdone; when Cap\'s voice vanishes from the radio, I cried. Stick around for the post-credits tease, where we FINALLY get our first look at THE AVENGERS (due in 2012); it\'s well worth it.,', ""People suck, that's the only reason this movie is rated to low! I love this movie!"", 'As there\'s something about the the 1930s-1940s that appeals to me, I tend to prefer movies set in the era and made in its cinematic style. And being fond of the adventure genre, I anticipate movies like the Indiana Jones trilogy, ""The Rocketeer"", ""Sky Captain And the World of Tomorrow"", ""The Mummy"" (1999) and, of course, ""Captain America"".When I first heard about this movie, my expectations soared. The director was Joe Johnston, who made my favorite superhero movie, ""The Rocketeer"". It was set during WWII, made in a 1940s style, and scored by Alan Silvestri. Alas, my heart sank after I found out that they were going to do the whole frozen alive storyline I\'ve always hated. But, I reasoned, the only reason they are making it is because of ""The Avengers"". Without that storyline, they wouldn\'t even be making it. Beggars can\'t be choosers.Well, after two years of waiting, I got to see the movie. And to my surprise, it surpassed my high expectations. I didn\'t even hate the ending, although I would have much preferred a happier one more in line with the original 1940s comics (in which Cap stays in his own era, then fights commies in the 1950s). So, here are my thoughts on the movie.Acting.Chris Evans was great as Captain America. He nailed the character. After watching him as Captain America, I can\'t see anyone else in the role. The special effects performed on him to make him look skinny for the first part of the movie were absolutely seamless. If I hadn\'t known about them, I wouldn\'t have been able to tell they were there. But those effects would not have looked nearly so great if it had not been for Evans convincingly ""acting skinny"". No matter what condition Steve Rogers is in, shrimp or super soldier, Chris Evans portrayed him flawlessly.It was refreshing to see a non-angsty, pure-hearted hero for the first time in a while. Instead of portraying Cap with irony or satire, they took him seriously, and it really payed off. Cap, despite (or because of) his delightful simplicity and earnestness, comes across as incredibly deep and human, proving once again that the notion of the old-fashioned hero being inferior to his modern antihero counterpart is merely a haughty assumption.Hugo Weaving\'s Red Skull was effectively menacing, darkly humorous, and overall deliciously like an old-fashioned serial villain. Haley Atwell was charming, feisty and classically beautiful as Peggy Carter. Stanley Tucci\'s Dr. Erskine was played to perfection, Tommy Lee Jones was a scene-stealer of the highest order, Toby Jones was very memorable as a sympathetic, almost lovable Arnim Zola, Richard Armitage was effectively despicable, Dominic Cooper was good as Howard Stark, and Neal McDonough made his presence known despite very little screen time. Sebastion Stan was also quite good as Bucky, although he wasn\'t quite as memorable as many of the others.Visuals and Action.My feelings on the visuals are mixed. I was hoping for a bit more of a photo-realistic feel, but it instead looks a bit too much like ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" (a movie whose visuals I like very much, but would prefer to be a novelty, not the norm). That said, the use of wide lenses did help make it look more real than many other movies with such massive amounts of CGI. The color in many scenes is quite good, or at least by today\'s standards. I did dislike the muted color used in some of the winter scenes, though. I wish they had gone for more of a Technicolor look, but I\'m pretty satisfied with the look of the movie, except for the winter scenes.I didn\'t like the action montage too much, as it had some slow-motion effects, as well as giving off a feeling that you\'re being cheated out of some scenes. I also thought that the motorcycle-chase felt somewhat rushed. Other than that, however, I did like most of the action scenes. The Kruger chase, Cap\'s first mission, and the final fight with Red Skull were standouts.I would have preferred that the HYDRA soldiers\' uniforms look a bit more Nazi-like, but the look they have works well. Red Skull doesn\'t care about them as individuals. He is the Hydra, and they are merely his many identical heads. Thus, their faceless, almost robotic look works very well. Music.Silvestri\'s score is the best superhero score in years. His main theme unfortunately doesn\'t have the ""flow"" that some of his better works do, and seems a little clunky at first. But after you hear it a few times, it grows on you. It\'s now stuck in my head. Overall, Silvestri\'s score hits all the right notes, and captures menace, adventure, and every other mood required of it, while having actual themes. Media Ventures, eat your collective heart out.Writing.The humor was great throughout. The levels of ""heart"" were set to maximum. The romance, although sparse, was memorable. Everything was portrayed swiftly, without padding, The plot was very well thought out. Memorable lines and scenes abound. Overall, the writing was excellent. Some things that I particularly liked were Steve\'s journey from shrimp to super-soldier, the USO scene, Cap\'s first mission, the role-reversal with Bucky, and the romance. I also liked how Red Skull was his own boss. It gave him more menace. Plus, using HYDRA ironically makes it feel more historically accurate. Having Captain America defeat the Nazis would mess with history too much, and having him lose to them just wouldn\'t do. All I really disliked were Bucky\'s death and Captain America getting frozen alive. That could work well in some movies, but a 1940s-style adventure of this sort just cries out for a happy ending. Plus, the modern-day bookends detract from the overall atmosphere. Still, the final scenes were poignant, although out-of-place.9/10.', ""At the time it came out, this was my favorite MCU film. I don't know how this one could've been done much better.The casting is perfect!! Evans was obviously the choice to portray Steve Rogers. I will forever keep Hayley Atwell in that red dress as a fond memory. Weaving as Red Skull? No brainer. No one else could've done it as much justice. Stan, Jones, Tucci, and the rest of the cast of characters bring the story together."", ""All too infrequently, a much hyped blockbuster hits the mark right on the spot. Captain America First Avenger is such a movie. It's the best big budget movie that I've seen this year. It hits a high standard of excellence by combining a cool plot, breathtaking action sequences, a heavy dose of self discovery and realization, charisma, a dash of patriotism, love and puts it all together in one amazing package. This movie will surprise a lot of people with its heart while sacrificing none of the fun. The inner turmoil worked well, the beautiful thing is that we can relate to each character, especially that of underdog Steve Rogers. His never say die attitude and heart of a champion makes this hero more interesting then most. Captain America delivers on every level and does so with great emotional moments and it's a movie that lives up to all the hype it has generated.Everything has converged perfectly, delivering what is now the best summer movie season in recent memory. It's certainly the best overall summer for superheroes. The cast is obviously stellar but that doesn't always mean greatness. (American Gangster, Wanted, Sphere, etc.) I'm happy to say this amazing cast delivers in every way. Believe it or not, Chris Evans himself delivers one of the greatest performances in a comic adaptation film EVER. Maybe it's because the character itself is one of the most complex and intriguing that any genre has to offer but that doesn't diminish just what a home run Evans has hit. They took the character seriously but still remembered to include fun and humor. I almost can't convey how much I enjoyed this film."", ""In preparation for its 'Avengers' who assemble next year, Marvel Comics ends the super- heroes showdown this year with its final prequel about the origins of 'Captain America' – the leader of the Avengers. Unlike the hi-tech flamboyance of 'Ironman', the might and super power of 'Thor' and the destructive temper of 'The Incredible Hulk', Captain America has little to offer but his devout patriotism and impenetrable shield as a hero. However, what makes him the captain, is the quintessential quality of compassion within the weakling Steve Rogers, that values both strength and power. After shrinking the kids, playing a live board game, recalling dinosaurs and creating werewolves in his movies, director Joe Johnston takes us back to the World War II era when in the midst of the Nazi turmoil, a country sent its troops to war with one hero, who would save the day for America. The diminutive Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) never gave up on a fight in the alleys. Being rejected several times by the U.S. Army due to his short and skinny stature was hardly a discouragement. Nothing stopped this patriot from repeated attempts and finally he was enlisted upon the recommendation of a German military scientist (Stanley Tucci). He soon became a part of an experiment that enhanced his strength and capability with a serum that made him the first and last of a new breed of super-heroes. Helpless with just one experimental recruit, Colonel Phillip (Tommy Lee Jones) insists on Steve staying out of war as just one hero would do no good. The tall and muscular Steve now sells war bonds while dancing on stage in various cities as Captain America. After much humiliation and insult, Captain decides to cross enemy lines and play a greater role by overcoming bullies such as the Nazi Red Skull (Hugo Weaving), whose Hydra initiative is aimed at world dominance. Captain America's adventure feels like Indiana Jones in its action sequences and at times like a James Bond movie with an ambitious villain who could dominate the world. At times, even the patriotism that is portrayed, can be overwhelming but then, our hero has to justify his name..... The problem here is that Captain America's back story seems to be a mandatory feature needed as a build up to 'The Avengers'. Although its period setting provides a richer backdrop for a super-hero story, one fails to engage deeply with the Captain's motives, emotions and powers. Without his impenetrable Vibranium shield, he is just a stronger human without any powers. Will he be greeted upon his entry in 'The Avengers' with the same fan- fare that Ironman, Hulk and Thor receive? Certainly not. He may have exceptional leadership capabilities through his mild, good-hearted nature but what is a leader without a team? That is what the movie fails to address and ends up being just another super-hero movie. Hugo Weaving's malicious plans of world dominance remind us of many European accented James Bond villains but, with a Hellboy appearance. He has played better roles than this one throughout his career and with a weak plot for world dominance, he has little to dominate on screen no matter how good he can be. Hayley Atwell as Agent Peggy Carter is dismal in her performance. Seldom has an actress portrayed such a straight face that became so forgettable. Tommy Lee Jones is fun to watch because he has the most vivacious character and Stanley Tucci, in his brief appearance is impressionable. Chris Evans is remarkable in his CGI enhanced (?) skinny version where his unfailing ambition is marred by his physical limitations. He is equally smooth in funny moments as he is when he is physically challenged in the Army training. Once he goes through his transition, it's as if he is a different actor altogether. Unaccustomed to his height and strength, it is fun to watch him realize his own potential. As a super-hero in combat, he is just like any other. Straight faced, muscled-up and awesome. Joe Johnston's Captain America isn't an exceptional movie. It's a good, passable summer movie with loads of patriotism and historic appeal that nurture our hero. The film's concluding minutes will be the one that resonates through the audiences but otherwise, it won't disappoint critics, nor will it draw applause from the fans. In the Marvel world, X-Men still rule supreme but there is a new team lurking around the corner of 2012 and it's led by a strong man with a bullet-proof shield.....7.818 on a scale of 1-10."", 'Yes, this is yet another comic book superhero movie. Yes, this is another Marvel comic big- budget franchise trying to get off the ground. You might start to wonder why you should bother seeing any of these if a new one just hits the screens one month later. First off, it definitely helps to be a comic book fan from the start, but beyond that, in terms of pure movie magic and box office trending, this newest chapter gets a little boost from being the last in a long line of films leading to a culminating epic fanboys have been frothing over for years now The Avengers! But, I\'ll dip more into that later, for now, let\'s look at the throwback hero of the group who takes us back to a time when heroes were not only cheered for their strength, but also for their conduct.Captain America: The First Avenger details the transformation of a skinny kid named Steve Rogers into the national icon (and medically-induced super-soldier) known as Captain America. Rogers is created into this new evolution of man in order to combat Hydra, the deep science/black arts division of the Nazi army, led by a ruthless tyrant named Johann Schmidt, who is more frighteningly referred to as The Red Skull (you know, cause his face fell off and such). Captain America must prove to the people who gave him his powers, and to himself, that he was the right man to do the job of saving the world from utter annihilation.I had fairly muted expectations going into this movie, mainly because Captain America is essentially a retro-hero, a classic clean-cut good guy with no character flaws. He always does the right thing, or at least attempts to, no matter the cost to himself. It flies in the face of everything we have been seeing in terms of comic book heroes over the last decade. The grief and anger of Batman, the drunken power trips or Spider-man, the ego and pride of Thor; all these traits give the characters layers that assist in making them human, someone the audience can try to relate to. Captain America really doesn\'t have any of those flaws, but here\'s the surprise they made it work anyway. The opening thirty minutes of the film we see Steve Rogers pre-magic-roid-juice, where he is a ninety-pound poster boy for the ""Before"" shot in workout ad campaigns. In those early scenes his struggle is how to find a way to match his frail muscles outside with his unbreakable drive inside. We find ourselves in the hopeful spot of routing for the little guy (and I mean really, really little, like me in high school) and those opening scenes help pull the crowd in, hopefully holding them there through what comes later.Once we lose the physicality of the ""before"" picture and it\'s replaced with superhuman ""after"" shot, it loses a bit of the charm. Chris Evans should take no blame for this, in fact I think he was cast perfectly. He held on nicely to the innocence of his smaller self and truthfully brought to life the heroic nature of those comics from the late 40′s and early 50′s. The real downfall was that he didn\'t face any real obstacle after he got his new physical form. We never really felt he was ever in any real danger because he could basically accomplish anything that came to mind, no matter how insane.On the topic of the shield, our iconic piece of comic book memorabilia, I was torn on it. I liked the design and the fact it could get scuffed up, dirtied and otherwise sullied, but I would have appreciated one scene where we got to see him learn to throw it. Within one scene of him picking it up for the first time, he was chucking it around like a world-class discuss champion, fully expecting it to return to him, instead of wondering how the hell that worked. The minor flaw sort of mirrors the bigger issue that the latter half of the movie was really just a long montage of Captain America jumping, swinging, shield tossing and otherwise being heroic (lots of it in slow motion). The heart fell out of it and the movie descended into flashy colors and catch phrases.In terms of the cast, as I said before, Chris Evans did a hell of a job and I look forward to him building up the character even more, hopefully with more internal struggles in movies to come. *minor spoiler coming*Sadly gone after the first thirty minutes, Stanley Tucci was wonderful as Dr. Abraham Erskine , the scientist behind the super-serum, which made the man out of the molehill. Tucci worked in such charm and natural flavor into his German accent and characterizations, I really wish he could have stayed on screen much longer.*spoiler over*Getting back to the real buzz around this movie, the next film in line for Marvel Studios is The Avengers, the first time any studio in the recent decades has tried to tie together a handful of other movie franchises into one single film. The Hulk, Thor, Iron Man, Captain America, Nick Fury, Hawkeye (who Jeremy Renner cameoed as in Thor) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson in Iron Man 2) will all assemble on screen for the eagerly anticipated culmination of Marvel\'s long term film plan. The genius inside is they are using all the original actors who made these roles so popular (with the exception of Hulk, who was played by Edward Norton in the franchise film and now replaced by Mark Ruffalo). For me, as a movie junkie, this is where the franchise will become something truly special. Just to see all those actors on screen playing off of each other is immediately worth the price of admission (and maybe a box of Raisinettes too).', 'Of all the Marvel comic adaptations, I most worried about Captain America because this is a hard comic to adapt. Steve Rogers AKA Captain America is essentially a flag waving, patriotic boy scout and that works in printed form but could end up being a cheesy corn dog on screen. True ""Thor"" is about an Asgardian thunder god but at it\'s core it is essentially a fantasy film and we have done that before, so I had a lot of trust that it would work. Captain America however is rooted in the real world and it would be really easy to make this a nauseatingly patriotic Michael Bay movie.So this brings us to ""Captain America: The First Avenger"", the latest in the current series of Marvel films that lead into next year\'s ""The Avengers"". Did director Joe Johnston (""Jumanji"" & ""The Rocketeer"") manage to bring Captain Steve Rogers to the big screen successfully? The answer is simple, yes he absolutely did. Johnston and his writers, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, have found the balance to bring Cap to life and one of the prime reasons this works so well was the decision to take the character back to his origins and set it in the World War II era. It would have been easy for the filmmakers to have a short World War II intro and then bring Cap into the modern world like the 1990 Albert Pyun version but we probably would have ended up with a similar mess.The 1940\'s wartime era plays into that patriotic symbol theme that is vital for Captain America to work. Today it would have seemed tacky to send Captain America to Iraq or Afghanistan. The World War II setting offers Captain America a chance to be a real war hero, in a time when war heroes were celebrated, and to fight a clearly defined, evil enemy that everyone recognizes as a threat. Smart move Marvel Pictures.The story of ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" is simple and for anyone who has ever read a Captain America comic, instantly recognisable. Week, puny Steve Rogers wants to join the army and fight for America. What he lacks in body size or health he makes up with bravery, heart and a solid moral code. When asked if he wants to kill Nazis, he answers that he doesn\'t want to kill anyone, he just hates bullies. After being rejected over and over again he is finally spotted by a scientist who is working on the super soldier program. The scientist, Dr. Abraham Erskine (played brilliantly by Stanley Tucci), recognises that Rogers has the right stuff for his program. A quick experiment later and wimpy Steve Rogers is turned into the super buff super soldier.Let me just take a moment to say how much I loved Chris Evans in this film. Evans has always played brash and cocky characters. Take a look at ""Scott Pilgrim Saves the World"" or the ""Fantastic Four"" films for examples. We loved him in those roles to be sure, but Steve Rogers allows him to play a really humble, polite and sweet character and even after his transformation, he retains that pure and humble spirit. He may have superpowers but he really is just a kid from Brooklyn. While other superheroes are dark, brooding and full of doubt and/or pain, Captain America is like a breath of fresh air, he is brave and bright. He wants to be a superhero to do good, simple as that.Okay, back to the film. After a minor action scene, Rogers becomes really popular in the USO circuit selling war bonds as Captain America, cheesy costume and all. It is when his best friend Bucky (Sebastian Stan) goes MIA that Steve Rogers jumps to action and the real Captain America is born. With a new costume, super shield and a crack team of commandos at his disposal, Captain America sets about systematically dismantling Hydra, the super evil science division of the Nazis led by Germany\'s own super soldier, the evil Red Skull.Hugo Weaving\'s scenery chewing performance as the Red Skull is brilliant and he often steals the film. In fact the performances by the entire supporting cast are rock solid and this helps Evans sell the more fantastical aspects of the film. Along with the already mentioned Tucci, Weaving and Stan is the ever reliable Tommy Lee Jones as Col. Chester Phillips (Cap\'s superior officer) and Dominic Cooper as Howard Stark (yes, Iron Man\'s dad). But I have to give special mention to Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter, Steve Roger\'s love interest. Atwell is not only physically beautiful but she also has guts and can hold her own with the boys. I found the mutual attraction between Rogers and Carter pitch perfect and I think it is one of the most successful love stories in the Marvel films yet. She is a star in the making and I look forward to her future career.So far I have gushed and to be fair I must point out that the film\'s third act does have a minor logic flaw, but in the great scheme of things it doesn\'t take away the sheer pleasure of watching this film. I found that I had a smile on my face from beginning to end.""Captain America: The First Avenger"" proves again that Marvel knows how to bring their heroes to the big screen like no other company can. It is simply the best Marvel superhero film yet and Chris Evans IS Captain America. I can\'t wait to see ""The Avengers"" in 2012.Oh, and one last note: stay to the end of the credits for the most satisfying post credit sequence to date.I originally posted this review on my site http://geekactually.com', 'To be very honest, when I saw the trailers of this movie, I felt it wouldn\'t do the job right. I love seeing comic books being made into movies, and I will add that I haven\'t read many Captain America comics. But Captain America is one of Marvel\'s biggest characters, if not the biggest. Every comic book fan knows his amazing shield and that virtually nothing can stop the hero when he has it with him. And this is why I was afraid. Once someone would take the idea and make it into a movie, that was it. There would be no ""revised versions"" or anything of the sort. There could be new versions but that would have to be years from now. You wouldn\'t want a movie like this to go wrong. I saw the trailers and I felt that that was exactly what was going to happen. The great name of Captain America would be ruined by a bad movie. I researched a little bit more to find who the director was and my fears grew stronger. Joe Johnston, the man who directed films like Jumanji, The Wolfman, and Jurassic Park 3? October Sky was good but that\'s a drama film. How could someone like that ever make Captain America into a successful movie? I went into the theater with low expectations. Forgive me if I bored you with this intro, but I felt if I wrote a review for this it had to be necessary.You already know I liked this movie, presuming of course that you read the title of this review. It starts out with something I didn\'t expect at all (I\'m not going to say what, and I promise I will not give any vital plot points away, just things you probably already know). After that begins the tale of Steve Rogers, a young man (boy if you wish to call him that) who wishes to enlist in the army during World War II, but finds it hard to do so because of physical problems (among others). But Steve has a good heart, and that makes all the difference. After that, well, you\'ll see what happens, but I\'m sure you already know our little protagonist becomes a lot stronger (and yes ladies, a lot more handsome too). After having watched Chris Evans in Fantastic Four as the Human Torch, I had doubts about him too. I\'ve barely seen any of his other movies but I obviously thought he was just a young pretty boy with not much real acting skills. But once again, I was wrong. Chris Evans is not Johnny (The Human) Torch. Chris Evans is Captain America. If you\'ve seen Fantastic Four and its sequel, forget they ever even happened. Don\'t make the same mistake I did and think Evans is going to be the same as he was in his role in the two movies I just mentioned. He may not be the best actor out there, but I think he fit the Captain perfectly. Mature and serious for the matter, determined, courageous, good-hearted. Chris Evans pulled off a magnificent job. Evans became his truer self (I\'ve seen some of his interviews and he\'s a pretty serious dude, but before that, I thought he was kind of a jerk based on his previous film roles). That\'s probably why he did this role better than he\'s ever done before. This is definitely his performance which will lead to him being called ""Captain America"" by little kids who see him on the streets.The movie itself was a bit serious, a bit darker than I imagined, and not very cheesy at all (thank God, that was one of my other fears). It has its funny moments, and its depressing moments. But you will enjoy it, at least I hope you will, just as I did. Most of the film\'s cast performed very good. Hayley Atwell was great as Peggy Carter, the rather badass British, and I enjoyed Dominic Cooper\'s performance as the smooth and intelligent Howard Stark (yes, Tony\'s dad). Tommy Lee Jones, as was expected, was great in his role as Colonel Chester Phillips, and Hugo Weaving was sinister as the nefarious Red Skull. Another excellent performer was Stanley Tucci as the almost fatherly Dr. Abraham Erskine. But I think Chris Evans did the best, maybe because I didn\'t expect that from him.The film has great effects, none extremely extraordinary, but they do their job perfectly. Based during the time of World War II, the movie adopted a sort of old-fashioned, 20th century style. And it works greatly. And the plot goes along just well with all of this. Somewhere in the middle, I did seem to think the movie was rushing a little too fast, but that\'s understandable due to length; it\'s longer than I thought it would be, 2 hours and 5 minutes. The film has its fair share of badass moments, moments where everything happens exactly the way you could possibly hope for them to happen. And moments where the film grabs you and makes you feel emotional, attached to the characters, especially Steve Rogers, who you stick out with from the start till the end. The hero marks the spirit of America, and has the power to inspire everyone throughout the world to be a hero, because as this movie teaches, anyone physically weak or strong can be one as long as they have a good heart.And if you\'ve read this entire review, I sincerely thank you greatly. But don\'t just take my word for it. Go watch it for yourself. Gather your opinions. And don\'t expect this to be the absolute best of the best because it isn\'t. But I\'m sure if you give it a chance, you\'ll enjoy the experience as I did.', 'I\'m not fan of Iron Man, but really enjoyed the movie Thor, so I wasn\'t sure what I\'d make of this movie. After the opening scene (which made me wonder if I was watching the wrong film), we cut to the 1940s during WW2. It\'s this change of scenery/time period that gives the film a different sort of tone/flavor, thus making it stand out from the crowd. It\'s like a good old-fashioned action adventure movie (which should be no surprise given it\'s from Joe Johnston, who directed The Rocketeer).Another large part of what makes this film successful is its cast. To any who doubted Chris Evans, he more than proves himself as Steve Rogers. Thanks to impressive computer-aided trickery, we meet Steve as a scrawny ""90 pound asthmatic"", who has a never-give-up attitude, but sadly nobody takes seriously when he wants to help fight the war. After befriending a kind scientist, Steve gets to be the first test subject in a planned long line of super soldiers. His transformation into the epitome of physical perfection is quite the sight to behold, as we see Scrawny Evans turned into Steamy Evans, who\'s a muscle-bound man with enhanced abilities and doesn\'t have a robotic suit doing all the work for him. What\'s important to note, though, is that what makes Steve a hero isn\'t the abilities he gains, but who he was *before* the transformation. It\'s just that now he\'s finally allowed to be the best that he truly can be in physicality to match his hero\'s heart.I really appreciated that he wasn\'t yet another wise-cracking smart-ar$e, as a lot of \'heroes\' seem to be nowadays, which makes him easily likable, and it\'s this endearing quality which catches the eye of Agent Peggy Carter, played by the stunning Hayley Atwell, who I have no problem saying is officially my hero. Peggy is the perfect woman, as she\'s got it all (brains, beauty and bada$$edness). Atwell plays her to perfection and Peggy is easily my favourite female lead in a comic book movie. There\'s a sweet relationship between Peggy and Steve that develops throughout the film and it\'s clear that she admires/cares for him not because of the way he (now) looks, but because of who he *is* as a person, his intelligence and selflessness. Evans and Atwell have excellent chemistry/play well off each other and are my favourite comic book movie couple.Other characters in the film include Tommy Lee Jones, as the gruff Colonel Phillips, who\'s a bit rough around the edges, but manages to show that he\'s not entirely without heart. Stanley Tucci is excellent as the doctor who sees the potential in Steve others don\'t. A real friendship develops between the two, and it goes a long way to making sure that when Dr. Erskine exits the film, we feel what Steve feels. This isn\'t the only important/meaningful friendship in the film, though. Sebastian Stan plays another likable character as Steve\'s best friend, Bucky, Their dynamic feels very real/believable, as Bucky is one of the few to stand up for Steve.Lastly, Hugo Weaving does some major scenery-chewing in the role of Johann Schmidt. Not everything goes according to plan for the crazy Nazi dude obsessed with becoming a god (when will these bad guys in comic book films learn NOT to experiment on themselves?), and he winds up becoming a disfigured red-skulled villain. I actually liked how the reveal of Red Skull was approached, with only very vague hints to what was lurking underneath the surface early in the film (like when he\'s standing in shadow, posing for his portrait, with copious amounts of red paint having been used to indicate something\'s not right). Once we do finally see him in his full Red Skull glory, this is when Weaving seems to really cut loose with the role and we\'re treated to a memorable montage. He\'s supported by Toby Jones as Dr. Arnim Zola, the \'Smithers\' to Weaving\'s \'Mr. Burns\' (there\'s even a sequence where Red Skull has an escape ship and Zola\'s wondering where he\'s going to sit, to which Red Skull basically replies that he likes to put his feet up. Okay, not exactly the same as that, but I noticed the similarity).The film has several standout action sequences that are imaginative and offer us something different to your typical explosions/gunfire, though one scene that I particularly enjoyed wasn\'t action-based at all. Before Captain America\'s even gotten a proper costume, he\'s stuck in tights with little wings jutting out from the sides of his cowl (all those who complained about the updated Captain America costume need only see this nod to the original version to realise that changes did indeed need to be made), but what makes this scene so memorable is the fact that we\'re treated to a performance of the supremely catchy \'Star-Spangled Man\' whilst Captain America travels around the country to boost morale, promoting war bonds. It\'s a delightful surprise/stand-out sequence in the movie.Thankfully, Cap eventually gets upgraded to much more practical star-spangled duds (which I saw described as resembling \'a tricked-out airman\'s jumpsuit, complete with a mask which looks to be adapted from a WW2 helmet\' and he also acquires a handy shield which doubles as a kick-ar$e Frisbee, which he performs some impressive shield-fu with. The only slight negative I found with this film was the ending, which stinks of being merely set-up for The Avengers (of which there is yet more set up for, plus a teaser trailer of, at the end of the film\'s credits) instead of the film feeling like it gets its own proper satisfying ending (much like Thor did). Sadly, the blossoming relationship between Steve & Peggy is cruelly cut short (their goodbye scene is emotional/very effective). Aside from the opening and closing scenes, I enjoyed this film immensely and found it to be a rollicking good time with a lot of heart to it, thus making it my favourite MCU film.', 'Joe Johnston has done it again, managing to take what SHOULD be great action flick material and managed to make it, well, boring.Don\'t get me wrong, the film started out quite well. The change from puny wimp to super hero was well done, as was the intro sequence with red skull. The whole nazi-mysticism mystique was done very well. But it seemed that after Joe Johnston filmed these two or three well thought out portions, the rest of the film was just filler.I caught myself looking at my watch a few times, just sort of wanting the movie to end - and this was at the 1/2 point of the film. The action sequences are fairly average for the most part and I really never got that ""edge of my seat"" feeling as the characters faced peril.All in all, an above-average film which could have been great if someone with better directing chops had been chosen.6/10', ""The Marvel character movies have been a mixed bag. I know when a film is being produced and directed by people outside the comics industry that some things are lost in translation and some things are changed simply so the director can put their individual mark on it. Up until last month, Iron Man was the best movie to capture the main idea of the character and story, in my opinion. Iron Man was a very true to the mythos and great to watch. Captain America is better and that is not taking anything away from Iron Man. Yes, still some aspects of the story was changed, but I felt this was a great translation that captured and added to Captain America. They handled the background story and cast of characters with intelligence. I think the original intent of Captain America's creator comes through and what his values were. They did a great job with Steve Rogers pre-super soldier serum with the visual effects. The plot was very good and moved along well developing the story. I do not even remember any bad language at all which is rare these days. If you like super heroes and want to be entertained for two hours then this movie will do it."", 'I not sure what to right, in 2011, this was my second marvel movie and the both were fantastic (TOR + Captain America). I love it. Guys just go and watch. I am waiting on the Avengers now. Also, don\'t miss out the credits they will show the Avengers trailer in the very end. This movie starts from the making of the ""Captain America"" and beautifully ends up in the New York City current day where Steve Rogers and head of STARK foundation meet. Movie has a lot of details about Captain America. Only thing which I might question was gun used by Steve. I don\'t recall from comics that captain America has gun but maybe I am wrong. Also, what I like was Tony Stark\'s father Howard Stark in the movie.', ""So I am an avid movie goer and a fan of all Marvel movies, but this one takes the cake, well for now at least.I knew from the start that if this movie wouldn't have been up-to-par the audience would strike back with vicious yells and profanity, because of the approval of The Amazing Spider-Man and The Dark Knight Rises trailers and the way no one said a thing after seeing the Sherlock Holmes trailer. This movie starts off in the present of a group of guys finding a mysterious craft of some kind and inside it lies the frozen Captain America. We all may know about him being frozen from a snip it of The Incredible Hulk extras but it seems as if they have done away from that.Cut to 1940's and we have a small wimpy but full of heart Steve Rogers trying to enlist into the Army. As you know form the trailer he gets rejected. I am not going to spoil the movie for anyone so I will let you go see it for yourself.The acting was above par and the choice for Captain America and Red Skull were top notch. Chris Evans is most definitely Steve Rogers and not Johnny Storm. Hugo Weaving, as always, gives us a great performance as a Nazi Scientist trying to rule the world with god like powers. There was not one flaw in acting on either side and the effects were amazing.Please if you are a fan of Marvel STAY AFTER THE CREDITS!!! You will not be disappointed at all!!Go check out Captain America: The First Avenger NOW!!!!"", 'I had been looking forward to Captain America for about a year, and I decided to make it the first premiere I\'d go to all summer. I got a group of ten friends and showed up hours early with Captain America merchandise and enough caffeine to stay up through Lord of the Rings in its entirety.What happened?Every single person in my group was disappointed. Needless to say, we still enjoyed ourselves, and I wasn\'t even expecting much, (Jumanji and Jurassic Park III at the top of the director\'s credentials), but, man, I couldn\'t help counting the flaws throughout the film.Positive: Chris Evans was surprisingly convincing. Also, our hero was truly inspirational (if not corny). The sets were nice, and the other stars filled their roles well. I was well entertained, and the first half flowed nicely.Negative: Oh, lord. I\'ll try not to nitpick. Most glaring was the absolute pathetic villain. Hugo Weaving (a great actor who manages to give his character some, well, character) plays a downright cheesy, sappy, crazy, and so un-menacing-its-not-even-funny chum nicknamed Red Skull. His back story is never laid out and only hinted at a few times, his followers are faceless drones with advanced weaponry but the brains and aim of stormtroopers, and his intentions are ridiculously stupid and unexplainable (his target is ""everything""? Oh, please). He was never threatening and never endangered our hero, not to mention his death was as anti-climatic as they come (Voldemort, anyone?)Also obvious is the cliché invincibility of the Captain. He leaps twenty feet as flames engulf him, he fistfights scores of goons, blows up crap all over the place, and never once gets seriously injured. Suspense? Apparently, there\'s no need when you have patriotism!The technology was just plain silly for its era. Leaving out the cheesy blue-shooting things (something to do with the gods? I don\'t know, it was kind of weird), there are spycraft, tanks the size of mansions, helicopters that look like spacecraft, single-person submarines, and (my personal favorite) manned bombers in the shape of bombs. Are they suicide bombers? Apparently.There is no attachment to the characters (anyone blink when his best friend died?), there are loads of forgettable scenes (notably the war montage of which the trailer consists, which might have made a good movie, I might add), and clichés (love interest walks in on random kiss, etc.) and downright sloppy pacing galore.I must stop here, but seriously, 8.0? Not even close. Enjoyable fare, but nothing to think twice about. Here\'s to hoping Joss Whedon improves upon Chris Evan\'s Captain in 2012.', 'With the imminent ""Avengers"" movie coming next year, only one hero\'s origin story remains untold\x85until now. Falling in line with ""Thor,"" ""Iron Man,"" and ""The Incredible Hulk,"" ""Captain America"" showcases the rise of Steve Rogers as the title character. Unlike the other films, which take place in modern times, this one goes way back to WWII, showing the Captain kicking Nazi butt! With a lot of ""Wolfenstein"" style occult mystique and a slight ""Indiana Jones"" sense of adventure, this movie has a number of solid action sequences, and plenty of imaginative special effects and setpieces. With its references to various characters and concepts of other Mavel movies, it fits into the franchise really well. It might take some stretch of the imagination to believe that Nazis could be this futuristic, but for a superhero movie, it\'s all good fun.The story in this case is pretty solid. The main character shows strong development, and for most of the movie, you really root for him. There\'s nothing more thrilling than watching the underdog getting the upper hand. As it goes on, much of the character drama and story development gets pushed aside by the action, but it still works. By the end, voila, we have the lead-in for the ""Avengers"" film.If there\'s any complaint for this film, it\'s that there could have been more. Whether it needs a stronger action setpiece or a more invoking sense of drama, I\'m not sure, but something seems missing, and nothing really makes this film stand over any of the other superhero films that have come out so far.The film is competently made, with decent (but never exceptional) photography. Editing is good for the most part, but I am not a fan of the montage in the middle of the film that makes the entire war campaign whiz by. A couple of action scenes seemed a little sloppily-edited, but it\'s hardly noticeable. Acting is swell; Chris Evans is surprisingly strong as the main character, and I enjoyed Hayley Atwell, Sebastian Stan, Tommy Lee Jones, Stanley Tucci, and Hugo Weaving in their roles. Writing seems pretty good. Production value is high, featuring lots of good (if not overly-slick) sets, props, costumes and special effects. Music is appropriately upbeat and adventurous. In the end, I\'d say the film met my expectations, but never fully exceeded them. But it, along with an all-too-short sneak preview after the credits, provide the necessary bridge to the ""Avengers"" film.Recommended.4/5 (entertainment: 4/5, story: 4/5, film: 4/5)', ""During World War II, Steve Rogers, a frail man, is transformed into the super-soldier Captain America and must stop the Red Skull from using the Tesseract as an energy source for world domination. There is a plenty of good performances and pulpy action sequences. The movie has a very good CGI and a beautiful origin story. Captain America The First Avenger is an entertaining ride that doesn't take any significant and creative risks.Rating: 7,3."", ""i went into this movie not really interested, getting to the point of not going....BIG mistake on my part! this movie grabbed me from the beginning and didn't let me go. i found myself mouth open and just hypnotized to the screen. i could relate to Steve rogers and how he wanted to destroy all bullys and teach them a lesson. when he turns into the super soldier his transformation is crazy. he looked so different when he was skinny. the villain red skull blew my mind when he tore off his face that was really a mask. the war parts are amazing and look real and when he gets his final shield, its so natural the way he fights and destroys the bad guys...the ending where he goes right for the ice with the plane, kept me on the edge of my feet! the actual end where he wakes in what looks like a hospital in new york back in the 1940s, but is really a set up to keep him from realizing that he was asleep for 70 years, it made me so happy they used that ending.Definitely go see it even if you thought it wasn't your kind of movie, you will be amazed and happy! 10/10"", ""Awesome! You won't waste your 2 hours to watch this movie."", 'Essentially an origin story, this was exactly how I remembered reading the Captain America comic books when I was younger, mostly sticking around how the sickly Steve Rogers (a CG- ed Chris Evans) became the beefcake he was through a top secret military experiment, and his constant battles with his arch nemesis standing for all things Axis powered personified by the Red Skull, played to perfection by Hugo Weaving with a German accented voice as the Johann Schmidt version. At its heart it\'s a clear cut battle between good and evil, although in this Marvel augmented reality, Evil is aided by the powers of the Cosmic Cube and the megalomaniacal ambitions of Red Skull and his Hydra shock troops, threatening to conquer the globe unless someone can do something about it.Hence the first act concentrated on the innate characteristic of Steve Rogers, a determined, never say die young chap from Brooklyn whose enlistment to the US Army has consistently been met with flat out rejections, until the scientist Dr Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci) saw something in him that no one else does, and selects him as the first of intended many in the army\'s Super Soldier project, as headed by Colonel Chester Phillips (Tommy Lee Jomes). It\'s almost a master-protégé relationship set up in their short scenes together, but made no less powerful with nice touches about what really mattered in a world that\'s embroiled in a massive war.Since there\'s always nothing too definitive out there as far as origin stories go in the comics world, it\'s admirable how Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely\'s screenplay still managed to extract the essence of the character, of what made him tick as the beacon amongst the do gooders, and explored how events pushed the man into donning the less than camouflaged colours into combat. Allies like Howard Stark (now played by Dominic Cooper) whom we\'ve seen in the expanded Marvel universe of films in Iron Man 2 as the military\'s main contractor, Bucky (Sebastian Stan) as Steve\'s best friend, and Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter the British agent and romantic love interest, all factored in to build Captain America\'s world, which if a sequel is made would be a challenge to try and set it in the 40s again since the events here were pretty much open and close.Action wise, while Captain America essentially doesn\'t possess super powers per se, still is the epitome of physical fitness, and Joe Johnston compensates this with large, and I mean large action sequences, coupled with plenty of montage to show the Captain\'s campaign against evil. And I thought there was a conscious effort to tone down the ""America""ness of a one man crusade, and assembled a rag tag group of United Nations typed mercenaries whose loyalty is to the Captain since he busted them out from near death. His trademark Vibranium shield worked out very nicely in the fights, choreographed just as how one would imagine the real Captain America do it, with the shield featuring heavily in all fights designed that it\'s more than a good looking prop. I\'d even appreciated effort to include the original shield Cap America used, together with a more logical reason how he had to don a cheesy looking costume that doesn\'t make camouflage sense, worked into emerging as an icon to rally behind in the face of adversity.Subtlety is one of the key strengths of the film, with Captain America\'s additional and lesser known abilities mentioned in passing but enough for fans to pick up, with numerous references in this film that\'s set up to reference the other Marvel films from Iron Man to Thor. While the romantic angle was severely limited, I thought the emotional resonance worked particularly well especially if you know how the Cap would eventually end up, in a way fixed by the mythos and unavoidable, being the romance that had potential and room to develop further.Some may say that a superhero film gets defined by the villain, but this one clearly didn\'t let its villain upstage the heroic character, which is quite rare. Not that Hugo Weaving did a bad job with Red Skull, but there are little evil deeds the Skull had significantly embarked upon besides pulverizing his opponents with no remorse, and his constant banter with scientist Dr Amim Zola (Toby Jones) to show just how egoistical he could be. Hopefully we will get to see more of the Red Skull in future sequels of Captain America, since Chris Evans signed for a total of 6 appearances. Evans too while being involved in too many comic book films as compared to Ryan Reynolds, will probably be best remembered for his Captain America outing than for his less charismatic Johnny Storm in the Fantastic Four, and balanced both the drama and hard hitting action well, believable as the man you\'d trust to rally the troops and lead them in the fight against evil.Captain America: The First Avenger ranks up there amongst the comic book based movies done right even if the storyline comes up as somewhat expected given its necessity to focus on the hero\'s origins. This is undoubtedly highly recommended, and as always, don\'t leave before the end credits have rolled off, for the first look at Joss Whedon\'s The Avengers, and from the looks of it, it\'s going to be one heck of a ride, especially when mega egos come clashing up against one another. Summer 2012 can\'t come any sooner!', 'Bright headlights cut through a thick sheet of snowflakes. A scientist, bundled as warmly as possible, treks through the sleet. Two other men, in matching black cold-weather uniforms, approach the scientist. He leads them to an excavation site which is easily the size of a football field; at the center of the site appears to be a giant wing and fuselage. The black-suited men cut through the fuselage of the mystery craft and enter. Inside they find the remains of a massive, frozen ship. One of the men brushes away at the snow and sees a shimmering red, white, and blue shield encased in ice.Tonsberg, Norway, 1942:Two caretakers for an ancient Viking ruin listen as their town is overrun by Nazis. Suddenly the front door blasts open and in flood multiple Nazi agents. One of the caretakers is killed in the blast and the other frantically begs that the soldiers leave him in peace. They pay no attention to the old man and instead open the building\'s crypts one-by-one. They come to one sarcophagus whose lid is too heavy to lift. A dark figure appears in the exploded entryway. Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving), a high-ranking Nazi and leader of the HYDRA sect, nonchalantly enters. He crosses the room, comes to the difficult-to-open sarcophagus and easily pushes the lid free. Within he finds the skeletal remains of an old Viking clutching a glass cube (the Tesseract). The caretaker pleads for Schmidt to leave it. Schmidt scoffs and tells how this cube would be the jewel of Odin\'s treasury if it weren\'t a fake. He smashes it on the floor and goes to the caretaker, asking where the real cube is hidden. The caretaker initially refuses but under threat of harm to his family, he relents, gesturing to a hidden drawer across the room, part of an ancient carving the size of the wall. Schmidt pries the drawer open and finds the real, glowing cube concealed within. Schmidt orders his men to shell the city and then shoots the luckless caretaker.At a recruiting station in Brooklyn, Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), a 20-something, 90 lb, 5-foot tall asthmatic eagerly awaits the opportunity to enlist in the United States Army. The army doctor gives a once-over to Steve\'s medical file, which reads like that of a 90 year old man, and rejects Steve\'s application as the military 4-F, as this is his fourth failed attempt to enlist.Distraught, Steve heads to the movies. He envies the enlisted men featured in the pre-show newsreel, and watches as other audience members tear up. A loud-mouthed, impatient movie-goer begins yelling at the screen ""Start the movie! I didn\'t pay to see this crap!"" Steve tells the man to shut up, and is surprised as the man turns around, stands up and towers above him. In the alley behind the theater the bully savagely beats the scrawny Steve, who bravely fights back, but is easily overpowered. When his opponent asks him why he won\'t simply give up, the bloodied Steve says ""I can do this all day."" James ""Bucky"" Barnes (Sebastian Stan), Steve\'s best friend, comes running to the alley. He swiftly kicks the bully away and tends to Steve, who is annoyed that Bucky showed up and got rid of the bully just as Steve got his second wind. ""Bucky"" is now an enlisted-man. His application was accepted and he\'s been assigned to the 107th infantry.In a celebratory mood, Bucky invites Steve to go dancing with a pair of girls on a double date. Bashfully, Steve tags along. The four head to the World\'s Fair in Queens. While Bucky canoodles with his dates, Steve watches as playboy inventor Howard Stark (Dominic Cooper) unsuccessfully demonstrates a flying car. Steve breaks away from the group and goes to another recruiting station. Bucky catches up with him and asks how Steve intends to forge his application this time. Unbeknownst to them both, Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci) while passing by, eavesdrops on their conversation. He is fascinated by the gumption of Steve. Bucky wishes Steve good luck on his latest application and Steve heads in to the recruiting station for his fifth physical. Inside Steve sits on an examination table and grows nervous when an MP enters the room, and is soon followed by Dr. Erskine. Dr. Erskine has all of Steve\'s prior applications on file. Concerned by Steve\'s failed applications, Erskine tests his character by asking if his insistence on applying for military service is driven purely by a desire to kill Nazis. The young man sincerely reveals that he is not a killer at heart, but does not like ""bullies"" regardless of their origin; he also shows little concern when Erksine reveals that he is German by birth. Won over by Steve\'s strong will and unwavering conviction, Erksine accepts his latest application.In a secret military installation high in the Alps, Johann Schmidt brings the glowing cube to Dr. Arnim Zola, his Hydra weapon specialist. The cube\'s seemingly limitless power enables Schmidt and Dr. Zola to power unstoppable energy guns and cannons.Meanwhile, Steve has been enlisted into basic training under the careful watch of Dr. Erskine and Colonel Chester Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones). He and his platoon are told that they are candidates for the government\'s latest Super Soldier program. Phillips is unimpressed with Steve and is vexed by Dr. Erskine\'s interest in him. During basic training Steve meets a beautiful but driven British officer, Peggy Carter (Haley Atwell), who seems to pity him. Despite being the smallest and weakest of the platoon, Steve demonstrates the greatest spirit, selflessness and ingenuity, especially when his platoon are charged with retrieving a flag from the top of a tall pole: as the other, more fit men in the company fail the task one by one as they try to climb up the pole, Steve casually pulls the pin holding it up, taking the flag when the pole crashes to the ground. Phillips, still unconvinced, tosses a grenade into the group during calisthenics and they all scatter. Phillips is surprised when Steve alone leaps on top of it, willing to sacrifice himself to save the others, before discovering that the grenade was a dummy. Phillips concedes to Erskine\'s decision.That evening, Dr. Erskine speaks with Steve. The two bond over a bottle of Schnapps and Dr. Erskine reveals that this is not his first time performing this experiment. He tells a story of how, prior to his emigration to the US, he was ordered by Johann Schmidt to create a serum that would give a man god-like strength. Dr. Erskine created an early version of the serum he intends to use on Steve, only when Schmidt injected himself his body\'s skin corroded away, leaving him as a sinewy red skeleton. Undeterred by the risk, Steve agrees to follow through with the procedure.The following morning Steve and Peggy wind their way through Brooklyn and come to a stop in front of an old antique shop. Along the way Steve points out various parts in Brooklyn where he\'s been beaten up. She asks him why he never ran away. He responds that running away, in his mind, was an invitation for further abuse.The two enter the antique shop, exchange pass-codes with an old woman manning the register, and descend into a secret military bunker concealed within. Peggy leads Steve to the heart of the bunker where they find Dr. Erskine preparing a medical capsule along with Howard Stark, and Colonel Phillips rubbing elbows with senators and dignitaries. Steve is told to remove his shirt and sit in the capsule. Stark describes that the procedure will first mean injecting muscle re-generators into Rogers\' major muscle groups which will then be bombarded with ""vita rays."" Erskine has made no secret of the pain Steve will endure but promises he\'ll come out stronger. Carter bids Steve good luck and joins Phillips in the overhead viewing chamber. Erskine\'s serum is injected into Steve\'s muscles and Steve is enclosed within the vita ray capsule. The capsule glows brightly, Steve yells in pain but also tells them to continue and the procedure is quickly completed. When the capsule is shut down, Steve comes out a foot taller and a hundred pounds heavier with solid muscle, which is just the most superficial aspects of his body artificially raised to the maximum human potential.Everybody, including Phillips, celebrates the success of the procedure, and descends from the viewing chamber to congratulate Erskine. A lone dignitary, in actuality a German spy named Heinz Kruger (Richard Armitage), stays behind, placing a small satchel on a chair. Moments later the viewing gallery explodes. Kruger descends the stairs and fatally shoots Dr. Erskine twice. He swiftly kills the guards and flees onto the streets with Peggy in hot pursuit. Steve tends to a dying Dr. Erskine, who has just enough energy to point to Steve\'s heart before he dies. Steve bolts out of the bunker, in pursuit of Kruger.In the street Peggy pursues Kruger, and easily kills his getaway driver. Kruger steals a taxi and aims to run over Peggy. Steve arrives in the nick of time, saving her from being killed by the on-coming taxi. Steve pursues the taxi on foot, running faster than a normal human can (and not suffering the fatigue even a healthy man would). Displaying superhuman agility, he leaps onto the roof of the taxi, dodges Kruger\'s gunfire and the two come to a crashing stop at the Brooklyn docks. Kruger shoots at Steve, who holds the star-imprinted door of the wrecked cab in front of him as a shield. Kruger flees to his Hydra sub, which dives underwater just as Steve arrives. Steve dives after the sub, punches a hole through the cockpit\'s glass and yanks Kruger to the surface. Kruger tells Steve that he is the first of many, that Rogers can ""cut off one head,"" but two more take it\'s place."" He then kills himself with a cyanide capsule hidden in a fake tooth, letting out one last ""Heil HYDRA!"" before dying.Meanwhile, Schmidt and Dr. Zola are visited by a trio of Hitler\'s top commanders, tasked with inspecting Schmidt\'s operation. They ridicule Schmidt, saying that the Nazi party no longer takes him and HYDRA seriously due to his obsession with magic and the occult and playfully refer to him as ""The Red Skull"", a name that infuriates Schmidt. Schmidt takes the three to his weapons lab where they are shown his unstoppable energy weapons and a strategic map of Europe dotted with targets. One of the three notices a target hovering over Berlin and confronts Schmidt. Schmidt quickly vaporizes the three Nazi officers. Schmidt announces that HYDRA has disbanded from the Nazi party and is now enemies with the world.The following day Phillips and Carter pick up the remains of Dr. Erskine\'s lab. Both are despondent because the only person capable of producing the serum was Erskine himself. Steve is eager to go the front lines of the European Theatre but Phillips would rather he be a lab-rat than a soldier in his army. Steve is approached by a senator holding a newspaper of the prior day\'s events, emblazoned with a front-page photo of Steve chasing down Heinz Kruger. Steve has become an overnight celebrity and the Senator has an idea that will be mutually beneficial.Steve is enlisted in the USO (United Service Organizations), and travels around the Midwest, promoting war bonds and performing musical numbers in a shoddy red, white and blue costume while carrying a triangle-shaped shield bearing the stars-and-stripes. He takes on the name ""Captain America"" and the show includes a theme song written specifically for him, features dancing girls and a short segment where he punches out Hitler, played by an actor. Captain America becomes an overnight success, spawning comic books and black and white movies. His antics drum up revenue for the USO.Steve is soon taken overseas, to Italy, where he is to continue entertaining the troops. Upon his arrival the surly and war-torn men tease him and tell him to get lost. He is soon met by Carter, who along with Phillips, is overseeing European Theatre of the war. She tells him that the men are unhappy because many men from their division, the 107th Infantry, have been killed in battle. Steve realizes that this is Bucky\'s division, and quickly runs to see Phillips. Phillips is unable to find Bucky\'s name on his casualty list and tells Steve to go back to his job as a movie star and a cheerleader. Steve asks Carter where the men, and Bucky, are being held. She shows him a map, and a known HYDRA weapons factory 30-40 miles behind enemy lines. Steve hastily pulls on a pair of army trousers and leather jacket over his Captain America costume, and a blue helmet with a white \'A\' stamped on the front. He aims to steal a jeep and drive into HYDRA\'s back yard, but she has a better idea.Howard Stark flies them both over the battlefield in his private plane. Steve surmises that Stark and Carter have a relationship and bashfully withholds his feelings for her. Just as anti-aircraft guns from HYDRA begin firing on Stark\'s plane, Steve parachutes in, while the other two escape back to safety. Steve stealthily makes his way into the HYDRA base, taking out numerous guards in the process.Inside, Schmidt and Zola are manufacturing enough weapons to wipe out every capital in the world. Steve makes his way to the holding cells where he sees hundreds of imprisoned men from the 107th. He frees the men and tells them to make a ""messy"" exit. Under the leadership of the ""Howling Commandos"" the prisoners manage to overpower their captors, steal guns and tanks, and escape from the facility, destroying much of it. Schmidt watches Steve by CCTV, and quickly realizes that he must be Erskine\'s man. He quickly activates several explosive charges that will level the base.Steve makes his way through the facility and happens across Bucky, who is tied down to an operating table, and has quite obviously been tortured. Steve also notices an oversized tactical map mounted on the wall, with various marked installations. Steve frees Bucky, who is surprised to see that Steve is taller than him, and commits the map to memory.The two head up the catwalks and find themselves face to face with Schmidt on a retractable bridge. Rogers punches Schmidt, who surprisingly stands his ground. Schmidt plays with his face, which has apparently come free from his skull, and quickly peels it away as a mask. The Red Skull stares back at Rogers and Bucky and swiftly enters an elevator. In the elevator The Red Skull tells Arnim Zola to meet him at another one of Hydra\'s bases and to take his car. The Red Skull escapes the exploding facility in a strangely-designed private plane while Zola sneaks away in Schmidt\'s roadster. Inside Steve and Bucky have a huge divide to cross to their freedom. Bucky crosses a trembling, buckling support beam and manages to cross to safety moments before the beam plummets into the fire below. Left with no other option, Steve backs up as far as he can and leaps over the burning chasm.Back at the 107th base camp, Phillips dictates a letter to his typist, telling how Rogers disappeared the prior night and likely perished during the battle. At that, Phillips berates Agent Carter for causing this loss and notes that unlike the indispensable Stark, she herself can be punished. Carter attempts to justify her actions, but Phillips bluntly dismisses her opinions considering that the loss of Rogers, the only successful test subject of Project: Rebirth, would be ample justification to close down their organization. Just then, Rogers arrives, with nearly 400 survivors of the 107th carrying samples of the Red Skull\'s technology including some combat vehicles leaving the base in a fervor. Rogers submits himself to Phillips for disciplinary action for going out in direct violation of orders, but is forgiven. At this success, Bucky calls for cheers for Rogers, who has truly become Captain America.The news of ""Captain America\'s"" success on the battlefield has swept over the world, but Rogers does not appear for his medal from Congress. The reason for that absence is in London, where Steve gives Phillips and Carter his best recollection of the HYDRA base map and tells them that he intends to go to those bases and destroy them one by one, and wishes to recruit a team of men made up of those he liberated in Italy. Steve meets the Howling Commandos in a bar and they eagerly accept the offer. While there all the men are surprised as Peggy enters dressed in a form-fitting cocktail dress. She ignores all the men, including Bucky, and flirts with Steve, telling him that she\'d love to have a dance with him some day.The next day Steve is summoned to the Brooklyn bunker to see Phillips and Stark. Steve is approached by a beautiful female officer who wishes to thank him for his service the best way she knows how. Peggy walks in on Steve kissing the enlisted-woman and angrily storms away. Steve apologetically follows her to Stark\'s lab, insisting that he gets nervous around women and asks why he should apologize if Carter and Stark have a thing going. Stark quickly shoots down the rumored relationship and takes Steve to his weapons engineering lab. He remarks that Rogers has become attached to the triangular shield, which Steve says is a handy tool in the field. On a table are several prototype shields with sophisticated components, however Steve finds a plain, circular shield on a lower shelf. Stark explains that the shield is made of a metal called ""vibranium"", which is lighter than steel and is vibration resistant and will absorb heavy impacts. He holds the shield in front of him and asks Peggy for his opinion. She playfully/scornfully fires a clip from a .45 pistol at the shield, which Steve ducks behind. The shield passes the improvised test admirably. As she walks off, Steve passes a sketch of a uniform to Stark.Steve dresses in red, white and blue fatigues, dons a blue form-fitting helmet and stows the newly-colored shield onto his back. Captain America and his soldiers, including Bucky, make their way across Europe, flattening Hydra\'s bases one by one, with Rogers becoming quite skilled at using the shield as a projectile weapon and also discovering that it can ricochet off several surfaces and lot lose any velocity. News of his exploits reach the Red Skull and Zola. The Skull is furious, referring to Rogers as a ""simpleton with a shield"" and murders the last man alive at one of his destroyed facilities.High in the Alps, Steve and his men have a mission to capture Zola in his personal train. Three members of the team, Cap, Bucky and Gabe Jones (Derek Luke), zip-line across a massive chasm and storm the train car by car. Soon Cap and Bucky are cornered by heavily armed Hydra soldiers. They narrowly defeat the soldiers, however Bucky is tossed from the train and plummets into an icy river below. Zola is apprehended.Zola sits in a prison cell and is visited by Colonel Phillips, who brings him a steak dinner. Zola rejects the meal, convinced that it must be poisoned. Phillips shrugs and eats it himself. He tells Zola that he broadcast an easily decipherable message, which has certainly been intercepted by HYDRA, saying that Zola had defected. He also knows that Zola is easy to bargain with since he\'s the sole HYDRA agent they\'ve captured who hasn\'t taken his cyanide capsule to avoid disclosing information. Zola, fearing that the lie will result in his death by the Red Skull, gives in to Phillips and tells him information of the Red Skull\'s only remaining HYDRA base.Rogers sulks in a war-ravaged bar. Carter arrives and comforts Steve over the loss of his best friend. Steve realizes that Dr. Erskine\'s serum rapidly regrows dead cells, making it impossible for him to get drunk. The two flirt a bit and talk about having a dance, once again.Rogers and his team prepare a battle plan to take down Red Skull at his headquarters. Rogers, dressed in a new uniform, mounts a Harley and charges the base. He easily dodges HYDRA soldiers and tanks and finds himself within the base, surrounded by a HYDRA army. He is taken into custody and led to the Red Skull\'s private weapons lab. Red Skull asks what makes Steve so special. Steve says ""Nothing, I\'m just a kid from Brooklyn,"" moments before members of his team zip-line into Red Skull\'s office.A climatic firefight ensues, as hundreds of soldiers under the direction of Phillips and Carter storm the base, killing many HYDRA soldiers. Red Skull flees to his private hangar, in which a gigantic flying wing, powered by the Tesseract, is preparing for take off. Steve attempts to catch up with the plane on foot, but is unable. Phillips and Carter arrive in the Skull\'s roadster, and the three take off after the plane. Just as Steve is about to leap onto the plane Peggy stops him and kisses him. Steve leaps from the roadster onto one of the plane\'s massive wheels. He sneaks into the craft where he finds dozens of kamikaze planes/missiles, each labeled with a different major American city. Hydra soldiers soon enter the room and Steve battles them, taking out numerous men and tiny planes. One of the planes, labeled New York, drops free. Steve takes off after it and manages to commandeer the craft and crashes it back into the flying wing after throwing the pilot through its rearward mounted propeller.Inside the large cockpit, Captain America and Red Skull have a fisticuffs battle. Red Skull fires his cube-energy pistol at Steve who easily deflects the shots using his shield. A shot is deflected into one of the cockpit\'s center consoles which contains the glowing blue cube. The console is damaged and Skull lifts the cube into the air. Suddenly a portal opens above him, showing starry space. The Red Skull glows brightly and is seemingly disintegrated. His remains are swept up into the cosmos. The cube, still glowing brightly, drops to the ground and burns its way down through the plane\'s hull before plummeting into the ocean below. Steve mans the plane\'s controls and radios Carter. He tells her that the plane is on a flight-path that will take them to the Eastern Seaboard. He tells her that their dance will have to wait. He pushes the plane into a dive and crashes it into a glacier below. Peggy can only hear static.Steve awakens in a 1940\'s hospital. An old-fashioned radio transmits the play-by-play of a Brooklyn Dodgers game. He gets up, looks out the windows and watches as the hospital door opens. A young nurse (Amanda Righetti) who bares a striking resemblance to Peggy enters. She waits for a response from Steve, who looks her over suspiciously. He asks why the radio is playing a game from May 1941... specifically, a game that he knows he attended. She reaches into her pocket and withdraws a two-way radio. Two tall soldiers in black uniforms enter the room, and Steve easily tosses them through a wall. Steve steps through the hole and is surprised to see that the \'hospital\' is in fact a movie-set. He runs through the dark corridors, pushes a door open, and finds himself in a modern skyscraper bustling with people in business suits. He flees the building and finds himself in Times Square, circa 2011. He peers around, shocked by his surroundings, and watches as numerous matching black SUVs encircle him.Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) appears and carefully speaks to Steve. He tells him that he\'s been asleep, in ice, for 70 years, in a state of suspended animation. The hospital set was meant to gradually introduce him to modern society. Still perplexed, Steve breathes heavily and sadly tells Fury that he had a date, as he realizes everyone else he used to know in the 1940s is long dead or very old now.In a post-credit scene, Steve is in an old-fashioned gym. He pummels a punching bag so hard that he knocks it off its chain and sends it flying across the room. Fury enters the gym and asks Steve if he\'s had trouble sleeping. Steve cynically asks if Fury has come with another mission. Fury replies in the affirmative.Suddenly we see images of all the superheroes, who include Steve/Captain America, Thor (from the movie of the same name), Tony Stark (from the \'Ironman\' movies), Hawkeye, Black Widow, Bruce Banner (from \'The Incredible Hulk\') and other Shield agents preparing for battle. Fury tells him that ""they\'re up."" His personal mission to build an army of superheroes is complete, previewing The Avengers.']"
32,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Marvel's The Avengers,848228,"['At this point, ""The Avengers"" has made around 100 trillion dollars (or so)--and so it\'s obvious that people love the film. My own daughter went to the premier in New York and then went to it on opening night in general release--and was mad I didn\'t take her with me tonight to see it! Obviously, she loved the film as well. As for me, I liked it but didn\'t quite share the overall exuberance for the film. Mind you, I liked it--but I think I preferred the earlier films before the Avengers team was formed. There was a certain charm that I didn\'t quite see recaptured in the film. Now the film is good--it\'s just that what I like in these other films I would have liked more of in ""The Avengers"". Specifically, the movie could have used a bit more humor and a bit more character development. When I read the IMDb trivia, it seems that originally the film had about 30 more minutes--all showing Steve Rogers (Captain America) trying to adjust to his new life. I would have LOVED seeing all this--and less of the HUGE battle at the end of the film. For me, it just felt numbing after a while and I would have liked more of the characters when they weren\'t fighting. Again, however, I DID like the film....but the earlier Marvel/Disney films I liked just a bit better. Just my two cents worth...', ""Superhero films are always fun to watch when they are done right, and while to some degree it is understandable why people wouldn't be totally enamoured with it(as seen in a lot of the negative comments, a lot of them being condescending though- enough with the ignorant conspiracy theories already!- and some not even worthy of being called reviews) Avengers Assemble for me was an example of a fun and intelligent superhero film that was done right. True, the story is formulaic but not to the extent that was too distracting. In fact my only two complaint was to do with one performances that didn't quite work personally. And that was Jeremy Renner who was rather on the dull side as Hawkeye, whose character development did seem a little rushed and underwritten, that Hawkeye has inner demons is made very clear but it could have come through more strongly. However the rest of the performances were great, a big shout out going to Tom Hiddleston who is serpentine personified as Loki, though Robert Downey Jnr's charismatic Iron Man, Samuel L. Jackson's no-nonsense Nick Fury, Mark Ruffalo's very confident Hulk(he doesn't make you miss Eric Bana or Ed Norton), Chris Hemsworth's dynamic and not wimpy Thor(if he was I put it down to his hidden demons character development) and Chris Evans' modest, heartfelt Captain America were equally great. Scarlett Johansson convinces mostly too, Black Widow's back story is intriguing and Johansson is wonderful when she acts fearless but when in her emotional, imploring moments her acting is rather forced and out of character for Black Widow. For a film with as many characters as seen here, Avengers Assemble still makes a vast majority of them very interesting(only Hawkeye really disappointed), in character and not one-sided and all of them have their turn to shine. It didn't feel to me like a film that tried to cram in too many heroes all at once for the sake of it. The film is very slickly made with astounding special effects and dazzlingly executed stunt-work. Alan Silvestri's score pulsates with power and the action sequences are exciting. The story may be formulaic and standard good-and-evil but is crisply paced and intelligently handled with just the right blend of humour, pathos and action with not one component over-shadowing the others. What was really enjoyable especially was the toe-to-toe with Thor and Iron Man and Hulk. What was really remarkable was the script, filled with thoughtful exposition and snappy banter that stayed true to The Avengers while also with Joss Whedon's own style that was apparent in a lot of his other work. Overall, Avengers Assemble may not be 100% perfect or among the best ever but it is still an outstanding film with a lot to love about it, and no this is not coming from a fake account or a plant, just someone who can be hard to please who genuinely enjoyed it. 9/10 Bethany Cox"", ""I'm not really a comic book fan, so after hearing the constant hype about this film for a couple of years I really wasn't too fussed when it finally appeared on TV. I went into it expecting not to like it much, and indeed the first hour seemed to me middling at best: some mildly lame comedy, a whole lot of posturing, and a silly storyline involving silly characters.Then things changed. They started to pick up, and the action started hitting home. Then all hell broke loose with a climax that felt like it lasted a whole hour, an hour packed with kaiju-style mayhem as New York found itself subjected to an alien invasion. And I was wowed. Never before has it been possible to depict such constant, wide-scale mayhem, but with the improvement of CGI technology it's finally up there on screen with all of its glory.And yes, I ended up liking MARVEL'S AVENGERS ASSEMBLE. What's not to like, really? The whole feel is kept light and there are so many larger-than-life characters that you end up having a ball with it regardless. Mark Ruffalo's Hulk is my favourite character by far - Ruffalo is far better suited to the role than Eric Bana or Edward Norton - but Chris Evans's Captain America comes a close second. Sure, I see this film for what it is: a mindless piece of crowd-pleasing, overblown CGI mayhem, replete with a silly, buffoonish bad guy - but at the same time I can't help but getting caught up for the ride."", ""The Avengers (2012) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Nick Fury brings together Iron Man, the Incredible Hulk, Captain America, Hawkeye and Black Widow to join forces and do battle against an enemy that threatens global security in this rather amazing comic book adaptation. I'll be honest and admit that comic book movies aren't my #1 type of film and it wasn't until just a month before THE AVENGERS opened that I bothered to check out the casts supporting movies. I enjoyed the two IRON MAN movies, thought THOR was very good, THE INCREDIBLE HULK was entertaining and I found CAPTAIN America to be decent but no matter what I felt about those films it couldn't prepare me for how much I enjoyed this one. Director Joss Whedon has created something incredibly special and you really can't help but think he's raised the super hero bar so high that many future films are going to have problems reaching it. When bringing all of these characters together, the filmmakers could have taken an easy route and just give us mindless action but that wasn't the case here as Whedon really delivered a deep but easy to follow story and he knew how to have fun with it. The constant banter between the superheroes could have led to some very unfunny moments but the screenplay was so smart in allowing each of their personalities to come through and then added the fun of taking those personalities and throw them at one another. This banter really turned into something incredibly funny and allowed for some great one-liners as well as some terrific action. When it comes to these type of movies I usually complain about a couple things. One is the obvious CGI but that wasn't a problem here because it just looked so realistic that it never took you out of the story and instead it put you more directly into it. Another thing I usually complain about in recent mainstream movies are the expanded running times. THE AVENGERS clocks in at 142-minutes, which made me nervous going in but it turns out that this film proves long running times are okay as long as you have enough to support it and this movie does. In fact, the long running time felt extremely short as the film flies by without any problems. Say what you will about comic adaptations but there's no question that THE AVENGERS is first rate entertainment thanks in large part to the great direction, the detailed writing and each of the performers fitting their roles and bringing them to life. This here is without question a complete success so future comic movie makers had better step their game up."", ""Nick Fury brings together Earth's mightiest heroes to stop Loki who is unleashing an alien invasion.Robert Downey Jr. makes this good and Joss Whedon makes this great. Downey has already shown that he's a movie star. He could power a whole franchise all by himself but the Avengers is more than just a one man team. This is a quintessential Joss Whedon Scooby gang, and he's great at the snappy dialog and friend-hate comradry. This is a whole team of heroes working together.Because of its timing, this will be compared to The Dark Knight Rises. Most seems to give TDKR more credit because of its darker grittier tone. Both are great but I like Avengers better. Honestly, TDKR is inferior to TDK. There are logic problems with TDKR. There are too many comic-book moves in that film. It's melodramatic in its emotionally manipulations. The Avengers is simply better written. Its dialog is better. It may be simplistic but it's more fun."", ""I'm swearing off super-hero movies. I've become abundantly aware that there are legions of fans out there who can't wait to see what Hollywood is doing with the classic comic book characters. But after three Iron Men and now this, I see a sameness in them all, and I'm not equipped properly to enjoy them as I should. I'm still rating this pretty high because it is amazing to look at, the special effects are beyond belief, and some of the characters have some dimension. That said, I think I would need a manual to really get the true impact of each character, what his or her powers are, and how they fit together. There is always some evildoing bad guy who has some history with the others. This is what makes comics what they are (I read lots of comics as a kid, so I do understand the milieu). When you get right down to it, however, they seem to rely mostly on beating each other over the head with whatever is handy. It's like watching professional wrestling which is sort of comic bookish in its own way. It's a cast of characters what represent simple things, both good and evil. I'll leave these to the kids and continue to watch movies with complex characters and clever story lines."", 'To love movies is to enjoy good movies, no matter how you define them. If there are good movies, there are bad movies. While some people claim to hate CGI, there are those of us who consider it another tool to make a movie, but think it can be misused.I like a lot of superhero movies. I have been enjoying most of the Marvel Studio movies, but some are better than others. It turns out I like the big fight sequence in the first Avengers movie because it clearly takes place around Grand Central. I can relate to it, since I am a native New Yorker. I take pleasure in seeing how the Helmsley Palace tunnels are used, and the Pershing Overpass. The Spiderman movie with the elevated train along Canal Street annoyed me.There are lots of movies that use ""movie geography"" that makes no sense and they don\'t all use CGI. There was a Michael Keaton vehicle about twenty years ago called THE HARD WAY which annoyed me with its nonsensical geography. The problem is not CGI; It\'s using CGI or other techniques to enable bad scripts.', 'Here we have ""The Avengers"", the five-year-old movie from 2012 that was really breaking all box office records back 5 years ago. The director and co-writer was Joss Whedon, at that point mostly known for Buffy and Toy Story, the film that brought him an Oscar nomination. But now, this one here is certainly his career-defining work. The era of superhero blockbuster films had already started back then and RDJ\'s Iron Man franchise was going well enough for using his popularity to bring up a Marvel superhero all-stars film. Thor and Captain America of course have their own films now too. But back to this one here. Hiddleston was still doing a good job and Loki as a villain definitely does not get old too quickly. Some great potential this character has. Not a surprise at all, Whedon was also going for comedy next to the fantasy, drama and action sequences. Most of it was working out well like the restaurant scene at the very end. The only parts I did not like from the comedy perspective were probably the Tony Stark one-liner moments, but that\'s also subjective.This film was nominated for its special effects for a BAFTA and an Oscar and lost both times to Life of Pi. Of course, fitting the box office success, it received many other honors during the award season back then. At slightly over 140 minutes, it is a really long watch indeed and I think there were enough insignificant moments to stay under the 2-hour-mark. But I still take it as it is as there wasn\'t a great deal of dragging which is certainly a success for its duration. Back to the villain, Loki may have been the primary antagonist here, but there is a lot more conflict in here, most of all the Avengers managing to grow into a team that manages to hold their egos back a bit for the greater cause. It\'s a long way to that. And when it\'s finally done, Loki reappears by opening the gates to hell or the gates to the ""other end of the universe"" as they were saying. So what was the best thing here? Yes it may be the special effects work indeed as they helped the film nicely to overcome a few lengths. And I am not talking about the spectacular stuff like the explosions here, but also for example about the more subtle effects like what Iron Man sees written in his mask.So yeah, overall I think this was a good watch. Everybody will have their favorites from the cast, but as the film is so long, every bigger character gets his solid deal of screen time. For me, these would be Jackson, Renner and ScarJo of course, even if I must admit that SLJ\'s character did not do a whole lot for me in here. It\'s a film you want to watch when you are in for some pointless fun. It\'s of course not a realistic movie at all from start to finish, but it\'s still a success and not just in quality, but also definitely from the commercial perspective. No surprise number 3 is coming out soon. Still the IMDb and RT ratings may be a bit too high to be honest. Nonetheless, if you are not one of the million people who have seen and rated this blockbuster here on IMDb, it really is high time to finally go check it out. Today was the second (or third) time I watched it and I think it does not lose any of its appeal on rewatch. Go for it, especially if you like Marvel films. I give this first (new) Avengers film a thumbs-up. The character are really interesting and fun to watch, not just during their introduction in the first 45 minutes.', ""It takes effort and skill to pull off a project like this.Twenty years ago Marvel had comic characters that translated into poor films while DC had Batman and Superman movies.Now Marvel Films have a juggernaut. They released their second tier superheroes (Thor, Captain America) to great acclaim and it all lead up to The Avengers film where the characters of the Marvel cinema universe converged.Iron Man as portrayed by Robert Downey jr is the main man with his witty one liners and conflicting with the more straight up Captain America. There is a lot of substance with Mark Ruffalo's Dr Banner keeping his alter ego monster at bay.Joss Whedon as co writer and director balances action, adventure and laughs.Each of the character gets his time in the sun, Loki is the malevolent presence.No wonder the film was a behemoth at the box office."", 'Loki (Tom Hiddleston), the stepbrother of Thor (Chris Hemsworth), teams- up with the Chitauri Army and uses the Tesseract power to travel from Asgard to Earth to plot the invasion of Earth by the Chitauri and become the king of Earth.The director of the agency S.H.I.E.L.D Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) sets in motion the project The Avengers, joining Tony Stark a.k.a. the Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.); Steve Rogers, a.k.a. Captain America (Chris Evans); Bruce Banner, a.k.a. The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo); Thor; Natasha Romanoff, a.k.a. Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson); and Clint Barton, a.k.a. Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), to save the world from the powerful Loki and the alien invasion.""The Avengers"" is one of the best adventures that I have recently seen and a dream for fans of comic books, joining the MARVEL heroes in a witty story. The special effects are state-of-art and instead of writing a long review, I suggest the reader to watch this highly entertaining movie. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Os Vingadores"" (""The Avengers"")', 'You could be forgiven for approaching this film with trepidation for many reasons. The most obvious is that it is a big superhero summer blockbuster film – a type of film that is popular but all too often disappointing (indeed an accusation that could be levelled at films featuring characters in this film). Secondly though, a common problem with all the various character films leading up to this joint effort is that they generally struggled to make all the characters fit and you had the constant feeling that all the positioning and introductions were hurting the individual tales just for the sake of this joint one; so I did wonder how it was going to cope with all these characters running around in one place.Ironically enough though, the character balancing turns out to not be a massive problem in this case and I think it is partly because they do all exist as equals within the same plot lines, rather than being forced onto others. The plot is suitably overblown and involves an intergalactic threat rather than a man-made one; again this concerned me at first because I didn\'t particularly care for Thor and I did get the feeling that this would be more of the same, with gods and mythical creatures running around. To a point this was the case here because to the casual viewer (which I am), these aliens aren\'t really known or understood but the film does make it work because it allows it to be just about serious enough to avoid spoof but at the same time generating sufficient fun so that you go along with it. In some ways it is the polar opposite of the other big superhero franchise out this summer (Batman) because where one aims for darkness and introspection, Avengers really has no interest and instead focuses on delivering fun and action in an easily accessible and enjoyable package.And this it does. Across all the characters we have good humour and banter which never undermines the action but rather adds to it, giving it a sense of fun that engages and helpfully prevents you questioning the detail too much or having things like specific comic banter stand out against the serious nature of the action. There are lots of nice comic touches and lines but for me Hulk randomly punching Thor was the high point (with the ""puny god"" moment being a very close second). The cast go with it and I liked that everyone did work together without any one specific character hogging too much of the screen. Downey Jr is fun as normal and he works well with Evans, who I thought was better here than he was in his own film. Likewise Hemsworth benefits from a bit of decent humour and fun (two things lacking in his own film) and Ruffalo makes for a good Hulk, again though he is helped by the lack of having to carry a whole film. Johansson and Renner are good in support and the rest of the cast features good turns from many familiar faces, none of whom get in the way but all contribute to the fun.It is easy to turn your nose up at Avengers because it is basically an effects-driven summer blockbuster about superheroes, nothing something that always delivers, but to do so would be to ignore the fact that there are good and bad examples of this and that The Avengers is one of the good ones. Colourful, busy, fun and generally very entertaining – it delivers everything it sets out to do and I found it very enjoyable for this.', ""I'm still having my fingers crossed that the Avengers will overtake Avatar as the most successful movie ever (until another movie burst and takes over that is). It would be such a great success and I would be so happy for Joss Wheddon. A real nerd amongst filmmakers he has made it big time. As we speak Avengers has broken quite a few records already and it is on a good roll. And all that is more than deserved. While I don't think it is necessary to have watched the other Marvel movies so far (especially not the different Hulks), the Avengers will make you want to watch more (look at your local video store for confirmation!).All the characters are here and have their moments. Maybe Thor is the one that gets a bit shorthanded time wise. But then again, he is god, so he wouldn't care anyway. Mark Ruffalo is winning (as a Charlie Sheen would say) with his performance as Hulk/Bruce Banner. Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man is entertaining as ever. And even if some claim that Captain America is not needed, I think he brings Gravitas and is more than valuable to counter the jokes of an Iron Man and bring some much needed bonding to the whole Crew. Chris Evans is perfect for that role.The movie has been criticized for the weak villain. I think that does injustice to the movie. While the characters (bar Hulk?) have been introduced to you, this still is a forming of a group. It is more about the Avengers, than it is about any villain. And I don't think Tom H. Loki is that weak (even if Hulk does disagree).I watched the movie twice now and I enjoyed it both times. Time flies by and you don't realize how fast 150 minutes can go by. I like the fact, that Joss does not treat the viewer as if he were stupid. So maybe some will not get the joke/bet between Capt. Americas character and Sam Jacksons character (though I reckon it won't be many), but I loved that the movie did not make a big deal out of it.Since this is a Marvel movie, you should know by now that there is a tag scene coming at the end. A friend of mine knew immediately what (or rather who) we saw there. You'll find the answer on the internet. That scene came in between the credits. There is another scene after the credits which as of yet, was not shown in Europe, but will hopefully make its way onto a digital release (DVD, Blu Ray or whatever comes next). I'm so looking forward to it ... oh and the 3D is nice, but its the story/characters and everything else that will sell you to the movie ..."", 'Well how do I put this across so it doesn\'t sound like I\'m trying to trash the movie? I\'ve been around since Stan Lee created Spider-Man, and some of the other Marvel super-heroes were around even before I was born. So I grew up at a time when the technology wasn\'t up to the task of putting what we see in today\'s Avengers on the big screen. With that said, it looks like what we have here is all sizzle and no steak. The CGI and special effects components of this flick makes it an all time blockbuster spectacle, so if that\'s what you\'re all about, you won\'t be disappointed. However if you\'re looking for a story with nuanced characters and an intriguing plot, you\'ve come to the wrong movie. This is all about wringing out as much action and adrenaline pumping machismo that any fanboy could possibly ask for. So on that score it works, but I need something more, even in a super-hero movie.With that out of the way, there were some genuinely funny moments in the picture that added the slightest dimension to the principal characters. Of all the players, Robert Downey Jr. probably brings the greatest sense of professionalism to his portrayal of Iron Man. He\'s out there, he\'s serious when he has to be, and he\'s a wise guy when the situation warrants. As for the the CGI Hulk - who ever thought he\'d wind up being the comedic sidekick in a story like this? He had at least two stellar moments that brought my theater to life, the rag doll whipping on old Loki (Tom Hiddleston), and the sidearm swat to Thor (Chris Hemsworth) that was so outrageous it just brought the house down.Apart from some of the witty comic book dialog, the rest was all relentless and gratuitously destructive special effects, exceptionally well done of course, but gosh, how much can a city take? Which by the way, is never dealt with as part of the aftermath of a super-hero barrage when a cosmic power like Loki comes to town. How about a film where citizen action groups bring charges against Iron Man, Thor and Hulk for destroying their city? Just kidding - how are you going to get them to court? Say, I know Stan Lee missed a cameo or two along the way in these Marvel flicks, so I was glad to see he showed up here, even though it was probably his quickest one ever. If you blinked you missed it during the cable news roundup following the final battle. It\'s going to be a sad day when Lee won\'t be around any more to make these appearances.And now for my final rant - as I write this, ""The Avengers"" has, in just two days, made it to #31 on IMDb\'s list of Top 250 Films. My post will be #495, so in less than a full weekend, movie goers have vaulted this film to a rating right up there in between ""It\'s a Wonderful Life"" and ""Sunset Boulevard"". Doesn\'t it seem like there\'s something wrong with this picture? Personally, if I were making the rules, I\'d allow all the reviews in the world right out of the gate for a new release, but withhold ratings on a picture for at least a year or two after it\'s come out. OK, maybe six months. I think that would take some of the distortion out of the rating system, and someone like Joss Whedon wouldn\'t have to go around being embarrassed by comparisons to truly great films.Back to ""The Avengers"" - stick around for the closing credits for a preview of the next mind blowing Avengers flick. You know they\'ll be there because Nick Fury said so. THANOS!!! You think they can destroy more property than you saw done in this film? I\'d bet on it.', 'The 21st century has seen more superhero movies than I can count. This year alone has already seen ""Black Panther"". I won\'t deny that Stan Lee created a diverse variety of do-gooders in the Marvel Universe. ""The Avengers"" (not to be confused with the 1960s TV series) is entertaining enough. It\'s nothing special - much of it is sensory overload - but it\'s nothing that it doesn\'t pretend to be. Loki is the common suave but malevolent villain. He could trick anyone into thinking that he\'s a decent person. This movie will definitely please the Leonard Hofstadters, Sheldon Coopers, Howard Wolowitzes and Raj Koothrapalis of the world.It was a pleasant surprise to see that one of the people in the World Security Council got played by Jenny Agutter (the nurse in ""An American Werewolf in London""). I\'d like to see a crossover between this movie and John Landis\'s horror movie.Anyway, it\'s not the ultimate masterpiece, but undeniably fun.', 'Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) of S.H.I.E.L.D. brings together a team of super humans to form The Avengers to help save the Earth from Loki and his army.I want to first address the IMDb rating on this film. Currently, it sits at an 8.3 and is said to be the 140th greatest film of all time. Now, no matter how good you think it is, does anyone seriously believe it is one of the greatest films ever made? I mean, really? I grew up reading comic books, so the films are a bit of a different experience for me than they are for others. I think the movies have the comic fans as their biggest base, which is good, because otherwise several references and foreshadowings are going to be missed. If you do not know who Hawkeye is, for example, it may cause you to wonder why a government agent is jumping around and shooting off strange arrows.My biggest concern was: how do you make a movie about a team where the individuals have such strong personalities? Particularly the Hulk, who is not a team player. This was addressed.', 'The Marvel comic book based films have made millions at the box office, and everybody must have been thrilled with a number of the best superheroes of the series being put together in the same film, and presuming you have seen the previous films with them it has been building up to this. Basically Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), director of S.H.I.E.L.D., is meeting some colleagues in a remote facility where the energy source the Tesseract has been found and activated, opening a gateway transporting the Norse god Loki (Tom Hiddleston) from Asgard to Earth. He steals the powerful cube and takes over the minds of personnel like Clint Barton aka Hawkeye (The Hurt Locker\'s Jeremy Renner) and Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård), and this forces Fury to reactivate the Avengers Initiative, recruiting some of the world\'s most powerful and special heroes, starting with Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). She goes to find Bruce Banner aka The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) who is hiding somewhere in India for his scientific knowledge of the Tesseract - no mention of ""The Other Guy"", while Agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) approaches Tony Stark aka Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) who also has technological knowledge - and his powerful mechanical suit, and Fury also brings Steve Rogers aka Captain America (Chris Evans) up to date with the situation, and he is still trying to get used to the modern world. While Loki disappeared into the abyss he was approached by the alien race the Chitauri, led by The Other (Alexis Denisof), and they came to an agreement that if they got the Tesseract they would help him take over the Earth. Suited up, Captain America and Iron Man travel to Germany where Loki is meant to be hiding and trying to ignite and stabilise the power of the cube, showing his evil intent to many people kneeling before him, he surrenders though when they fight and catch him. In this process though the villain\'s half-brother Thor (Chris Hemsworth) arrives, also transported from Asgard, and he plans to take and deal with him in his own way, and this turns into a fight between him, Iron Man and Captain America, but it eventually stops. Loki is placed into a cell, designed to hold The Hulk inside if Banner turns, and now with Thor recruited as well the Avengers argue about how to handle the alien dictator, and there is the revelation that S.H.I.E.L.D. plan to harness the Tesseract to develop weapons. Fury explains that he heard about what happened in Mexico, when Thor was previously on Earth, and that the attack makes Earth an easy target, and the weapons will be good defence for a similar attack, and as the argument continues Loki\'s mind controlled agents infiltrate the ship, the Helicarrier. Captain America and Iron Man try to start the engines again, while Thor tries fight against Banner who has become The Hulk and may destroy the ship from the inside, and fighting with Barton, Romanoff discovers a hard hit to the head will knock possessed people back to normal. In the struggle Loki kills Agent Coulson and escapes the ship, Banner as Hulk and Thor are ejected from the ship and fall to the ground, and Fury uses the death of Coulson to encourage the Avengers left to come together, work as a team and save the world. They know that the villain wants to become ruler as well as destroy cities, and using Dr. Selbig he has created a device to open the gateway and allow the Chitauri to invade and attack Manhattan, and it is up to Captain America, Iron Man, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Thor and The Hulk to save the day. In the end, after Dr. Selvig is revived, so much explosive fighting, and a prevented missile blowing up in space, Loki is taken back with the Tesseract by Thor to Asgard, the Avengers go their separate ways, until a new threat to the world emerges, and the final scene sees The Other meeting his master, who turns and reveals himself to be Thanos. Also starring Cobie Smulders as Agent Maria Hill, Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts, Paul Bettany as Jarvis, Sudden Death\'s Powers Boothe as World Security Council, Jenny Agutter as World Security Council, Harry Dean Stanton as Security Guard, Lou Ferrigno as the voice of The Hulk and a cameo by Stan Lee. The cast are all fantastic, Downey Jr. with all the quips, Evans as the sensible fighter, Ruffalo as the man trying to control his temper, Hemsworth as the arrogant warrior, Johansson as the confident female, and Jackson as the intelligent controller. It should be noted that the title was changed in Britain from The Avengers because there would be confusion with the Honor Blackman/Dianna Rigg TV series, and also there were small complaints about Spider-Man and Wolverine absent, but it doesn\'t matter. Anyway, the story and scripting are very well made, and what steals the show is the brilliantly paced fight sequences filled with the most spectacular and ground breaking special effects to create all the superhero gadgets and gimmicks, invading creatures, and constant explosions, this is definitely one of the greatest superhero movies of the last few years, a must see action fantasy. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Special Visual Effects. Very good!', ""When a revolutionary power source, known as the Tesseract, is brought into operation something goes wrong; it is meant to bring unlimited energy from outer space but instead it is used by the evil Loki to teleport himself to Earth. Using his powers he steals the Tesseract and takes control of scientist Dr Erik Selvig and SHIELD agent Clint Barton. He intends to give the Tesseract to The Other in exchange for an army to conquer Earth. First he will have to gain certain items to open a large enough portal for his army. Meanwhile SHIELD director Nick Fury assembles the world's superheroes to battle Loki. They aren't natural team players and are soon bickering and fighting amongst themselves. Loki is captured with surprising ease\x85 almost as if being captured was part of his plan.If you are a fan of the superhero genre then I'm sure this will be a must see; if like me you aren't exactly a fan of the genre but do enjoy the occasional superhero film then this is one that is worth watching. The fact that it includes several varied superheroes is rather fun. Having only seen the 'Iron Man' films and the old '70s Hulk TV series I wasn't familiar with most of them but that didn't really matter as it soon becomes apparent what powers each of them have and the reason for those powers isn't really important. There is lots of action throughout this is all pretty exciting and the technology they use looks great; I particularly liked the Helicarrier, a flying aircraft character reminiscent of the 'Cloud Base' in 'Captain Scarlet' only this one is introduced to us when it is in the water. Even on a fairly small scene the climactic scenes look good but would recommend watching on the largest screen you can to get the full effect. The cast does a fine job making their unbelievable characters believable. Overall I'd say this is a fine example of the genre that is suitable for all but younger children."", 'First of all I must admit that I am not much particularly a fan of superheroes in general, but I have seen the movies leading up to this, simply because they were available and I had the time. And I had read up on the hype around this movie, so I might as well give it a go as well.And as a fairly non-superhero kind of guy, well I must say that ""The Avengers"" was one interesting and exciting ride of an action movie. The story was, for me at least, rather slow paced up to the point where the alien army came through the portal. Sure, it was building up character and getting the various characters introduced properly to those not having seen any of the prior movies.The effects in ""The Avengers"" were top notch, as to be expected from a movie of this caliber. Lots of really great effects and visuals. However, when that aircraft carrier ship started to transform and then fly, I was ready to turn off the movie. That was just silly. But I decided to keep watching and look past that one particular horrendous scene.However, one thing did make me wonder, with all the destruction in New York, you didn\'t see a single civilian getting hit or killed in any way, that was just stupid, especially with so many people living there. In fact, you only saw very few deaths throughout the entire movie, which was sort of lame.Another thing puzzled me, when Bruce Banner turned into The Hulk for the first time in the movie, he was out of control, smashing everything and everyone in sight. But somehow he magically overcame that and was fully in control the second time. That just seemed very implausible and sort of contradicted what we had just seen at the first transformation.And as with the previous Marvel movies with these characters, they had some great performances to the movie. I think that it was actually Tom Hiddleston who plays Loki who put on the most memorable performance in the movie and stood out the most.""The Avengers"" was good entertainment, even for an anti-superhero guy like myself. Great action. Lots of destruction. And great special effects.', ""Having already starred in their own standalone movies, Thor (Chris Hemsworth), The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo, taking over the role from Edward Norton), Captain America (Chris Evans), and Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) team up with Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) to form The Avengers, a team of superheroes-operating under the command of Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. (Samuel L. Jackson)-who are called upon to battle evil Asgardian Loki (Tom Hiddleston) when he threatens to invade the planet with his Chitauri army.The Avengers made an absolute mint at the box-office, proving to me that a large percentage of cinema-goers aren't all that fussed about an innovative or intelligible script just so long as they get plenty of bang for their buck. Written and directed by Joss Whedon, The Avengers Assemble (as it is known in the UK) is an unnecessarily convoluted superhero blockbuster wrapped around the most tired of premises: an evil being seeking a mystical energy source that will give him the power to rule the world. This trite set-up allows for countless effects filled battles during which no-one suffers anything more than a bruised ego.An impressive line-up of Hollywood A-listers and the most spectacular state-of-the-art CGI effects money can buy do not alter the fact that this is predictable, clichéd nonsense told with little style, coherence or originality."", ""Simple-minded live-action comic book extravaganza uniting Earth's resident superheroes to thwart Thor's adoptive brother Loki and his faceless army from destroying the world. The 3D effects aren't terribly good, though the film looks expensive and is top-heavy with crushing destruction (taking place in Manhattan, somewhat disconcerting in the post-9/11 years), coupled with blisteringly loud sound effects. Robert Downey Jr. brings his usual panache to the fore as Tony Stark/Iron Man, and Chris Evans is a wonderfully well-scrubbed Captain America, but others in the all-star cast (particularly Scarlett Johansson, Samuel L. Jackson, Mark Ruffalo and, in a cameo, Gwyneth Paltrow) just appear to be slumming. The script (by Joss Whedon, who also directed) could only be amazing and complex to comic book fans who haven't been comic book fans for very long. It's a mechanical enterprise for audiences looking to be uplifted by the sight of buildings (and people) being obliterated...and the patriotic revenge therein. ** from ****"", ""Yes, Stan Lee does have a short 'cameo' role in The Avengers. I re-watched the first 10 or so minutes after I had seen the whole movie, doing so helps put the whole story in perspective. The USA, NASA, and the World Council are all interested in the small cube of energy captured at one time, it allows a portal to a different part of the universe. When it gets a mind of its own in the lab, the mythical god Loki appears with a giant burst of energy, and right away we see he is up to no good. If he can position the energy cube outside, pointed to the sky, his legions will be able to enter and take over the Earth. The main star, in a movie filled with stars, is Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark and Iron Man. We also have Chris Evans as Steve Rogers and Captain America, Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner and The Hulk, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Loki's brother, Scarlett Johansson (my favorite) as Natasha Romanoff and Black Widow, and Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton and Hawkeye. Tom Hiddleston is good and sinister as Loki.We eventually find out, after Tony Stark figures it out, that Loki's approach is to alienate each human superhero against the others, divide and conquer. Humans are eventually saved when the six superheros band together and each uses his and her special powers to defeat the aliens.Of course there is lots of action, much of it taking place on a very large aircraft carrier that can transform itself into a giant flying carrier. Then the final action is in Manhattan, with quite a bit of destruction. In the end it is Stark as Iron Man that diverts a missile with a nuclear warhead, steering it through the upper opening of the portal, destroying the mothership which was responsible for keeping the battle going.Other key characters were Clark Gregg as Agent Phil Coulson, pretty Cobie Smulders dressed in a sleek black outfit as Agent Maria Hill, Stellan Skarsgård as the scientist Selvig, Samuel L. Jackson as facility head Nick Fury, and Gwyneth Paltrow back as Stark's girl Friday, Pepper Potts .Overall a fine action comic book movie."", 'Any comic book movie - worth its salt far as budgets go - can give us terrific action with mind-blowing CGI and special effects. Marvel\'s The Avengers, the culmination of the work of five movies (one of them a sequel to the first, Iron Man), is stuffed with a good load of action and mayhem and a climax that bursts at the seams with aliens being torn apart by the heroes Captain America, Incredible Hulk, Thor and Tony Stark (plus relative newcomers Black Widow and Hawkeye, with Nick Fury and Agent Colson in the wings), and if you want to get your money shots, Joss Whedon doesn\'t skimp out. But the reason why he was chosen as the filmmaker here wasn\'t just for name cachet (though it probably helped).What Whedon\'s done over much of his career in TV and other films and webseries (Buffy, Firefly, Dr. Horrible, Angel, etc) was excel at bringing groups of people together against fantastical, supernatural, other-worldly/alien forces, but making it always about stakes, humor, horror, drama and solid conflicts. Villains don\'t just act nasty, they have their own logic and reasons for doing what they do, and if they\'re not sympathetic they certainly are understandable as characters, full of the stuff that makes them great to watch, especially with the best dialog probably out of anyone (i.e. the Mayor on Buffy, for those that recall).So here we get Loki, previously a villain in Thor (and later sort of brought back for Thor 2), and is by far the highlight of the film as Tom Hiddleston chews up scenery, but does it in a kind of elegant, theatrical, relishing way. By the time he spews out \'Muelling quim"", you\'re on the edge of your seat. His performance, what he does with every moment of screen time, is much more exciting than any alien snake going through the sky. And yet his ego and petty-mindedness does him in, and Whedon has a lot of fun writing this character, making him a threat but someone who can be taken down under the circumstances.This is one of the best of the Marvel films just by the way that Whedon goes about the sort of \'Ghostbusters/Ninja Turtles\' formula - the four main players, each distinct, playing off one another, but things could turn on a dime any moment amid the jokes and this and that. Along with Hiddleston, Downey once again makes Tony Stark a helluva great character to take in as he is constantly thinking even as he is laying his sarcasm and deadpan on the other characters. And Johansson actually has a few really great scenes - Whedon has always written women characters as complex to the point that they put other ""complex"" male characters to shame - and somehow amid the many characters and plot turns going on, she stands out, especially Widow\'s scene with Loki. Ruffalo, too, does a lot with a little... until he gets to the ""other guy"".I don\'t know if Avengers is great art, but it does what I want to see when I go to big giant behemoth-like spectacles: provide me a host of characters who have to work together, and gives them interesting, entertaining and believable things to say. At 142 minutes it goes by at a great pace as well - not too fast, not too slow, nothing drags here, and that counts as well. Along with the first Iron Man and the recent Marvel Netflix show Daredevil, this is the MCU at the top of their game.', 'After waiting a couple weeks, I finally got to see The Avengers with my movie theatre-working friend. Yay, I have now seen Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, and the Hulk battle Loki and his minions from Asgard as the latter try to invade New York City. Co-written and directed by legendary TV icon Joss Whedon (""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", ""Angel"", and ""Firefly""), he does not disappoint with his love of pop culture and comics as he gives the Marvel characters their justly celebrated status as the distinct characters we\'ve grown to love growing up reading their illustrated adventures in the four-color world they inhabit. And seeing it all in 3-D is such an awesome experience! Oh, and it\'s great in also seeing Hawkeye, Black Widow, and Nick Fury in tow. Really, all I\'ll say is you must watch The Avengers. P.S. Seeing Cobie Smulders as one of the characters makes me wonder if she and her ""How I Met Your Mother"" co-star Alyson Hannigan, formerly a ""Buffy"" star, have traded stories of what it\'s like to work for Mr. Whedon. How I\'d like to be a fly on that wall!', 'This film tells the story of a team of superheroes who save the world from an evil and ambitious extraterrestrial man.Being a blockbuster, ""The Avengers"" does have all the elements to entertain the crowd. The idea of putting all the superheroes in one film is a good idea, because viewers get great value for the price of a ticket. The stellar cast and the constant action is quite amazing. The visual effects are great, especially the finale which lasts for an hour! The massive destruction of Manhattan is literally earth shattering, I was quite in awe of the aliens flying through the skyline, and all the action that goes on. I enjoyed the film a lot.', 'From the imagination of director/writer Joss Whedon, a powerful and loud action spectacle consumes the screen. Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) of the global peacekeeping organization S.H.I.E.L.D. summons the services of the diverse and disparate group of heroes Captain America (Chris Evans), The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Black Widow (Scarlett Johnansson), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and the Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), when the power hungry brother of Thor, Loki (Tom Hiddleston), is egotistical and brazen enough to attempt to control and rule the earth.Outstanding special effects and cinematography. Sound is also a priority and contains a soundtrack that features AC/DC, Soundgarden, Emile Millar and The Takacs Quartet.A myriad of other players in the cast: Clark Gregg, Cobie Smulders, Stellan Skarsgard, Powers Boothe, Harry Dean Stanton, Jerzy Skolimowski, Gwyneth Paltrow, Donald Li, Alexis Denisof and Stan Lee.', 'Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), director of S.H.I.E.L.D. (Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement, and Logistics Division), arrives at S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters outside of Santa Fe, New Mexico, during an evacuation. The Tesseract, an energy source of unknown potential, has activated. It opens a portal through space and the exiled Norse god Loki (Tom Hiddleston) steps through, carrying a strange spear with a blue glowing tip. Loki takes the Tesseract and uses the spear to take control of the minds of several SHIELD personnel, including Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård) , and Agent Clint ""Hawkeye"" Barton (Jeremy Renner), to aid him in his getaway. SHIELD personnel pull out of their base when an energy surge from the Tesseract causes the ground beneath the base to collapse and destroying it. A short pursuit of Loki fails to capture him.In response to the attack, Nick Fury issues a state of emergency, telling his top agents Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg), Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson), and Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders), that they are completely out of options. Fury pulls Romanoff and Coulson out of their respective assignments and sends them to find the heroes he needs to oppose Loki. Romanoff is found in Eastern Europe interrogating suspects, and Coulson pulls her off the assignment and sends her to find ""the big guy"": Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), aka The Incredible Hulk. Banner has been living in exile in India working for a hospital in Calcutta helping sick people, and has found inner peace doing so. Romanoff tells Banner about the Tesseract and its\' destructive capabilities. As the world\'s expert on gamma rays, Banner is their best chance to find the cube\'s location.During a video chat with the World Security Council, the superiors who run S.H.I.E.L.D., Fury is grilled about his plan to bring about the Avengers Initiative. The WSC are furious, saying that it\'s the wrong thing to do and these people will never work together as a group. Fury says they have no other option and this is their only hope of defeating Loki. The superiors reluctantly agree.Steve Rogers, (Chris Evans) on the other hand, is relatively easy to find. S.H.I.E.L.D. has been keeping tabs on him since he was found in the ice and still alive. Fury goes to greet Rogers at his gymnasium where he finds he doesn\'t sleep. Fury tells Rogers that he will find a briefing packet about what\'s going on back at his apartment. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is seen in a new Iron Man armor that has underwater capabilities. He is installing a new electrical connection that will take his office building completely off the electrical grid allowing it to become self sustaining. He\'s greeted at his office by Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) who tells him that it\'s date night. Tony wants Pepper to know how it feels to be a genius and after an argument about how much credit she should get for coming up with the Stark Tower idea, date night is off. Coulson arrives, and Tony quickly and repeatedly tries to cut him off. Coulson hands Tony a laptop with all the data on it about everything that\'s going on. Pepper decides instead to go to Washington DC to get the zoning permits for the next two buildings for Stark Tower as it seems Tony has homework to do, and a lot of it.On the airplane to the secured location - an aircraft carrier that can convert to a flying aircraft carrier, Coulson is telling Rogers about how it\'s such an honor that they found him and tells him about his Captain America trading card collection. They then head to the helicarrier and Rogers is introduced to Dr. Bruce Banner. The two then wonder what kind of ride they\'re in for. Rogers thinks it\'s a submarine but the last thing Dr. Banner should be riding in is a submerged, pressurized metal container. The carrier takes off. On board, they are briefed that Dr. Selvig and Loki have been traced to Stuttgart, Germany.Rogers\' first assignment is to go to Stuttgart to arrest Loki and bring him on board the helicarrier. Loki is at a formal black tie gala at an art museum where he is kidnapping a doctor who harbors the element they need to make the Tesseract work. While Dr. Selvig creates a distraction and Hawkeye kills the men guarding the building, Loki carries out his plan. Outside, he is instructing the civilians present that they need to kneel before him - or else, and that freedom is life\'s great lie. However, one old man stands up in defiance, and Loki prepares to strike him down. However, the killing shot is neatly blocked by the shield of Rogers as Captain America before moving to confront the god. As Rogers battles Loki, Tony makes his entrance to the tune of AC/DC\'s ""Shoot To Kill"" with full Iron Man weapons drawn to knock down the god and daring Loki to make a move.Loki quickly surrenders when the two heroes arrive, and while being flown to the high tech prison on board the helicarrier, the plane encounters a lighting storm. Rogers asks Loki if he\'s afraid of lighting but Loki tells him it\'s not the lightning that he\'s afraid of. It\'s what follows. Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Loki\'s half-brother and the Norse God of thunder, arrives and attempts to capture Loki so Loki can face Asguardian justice for his crimes (which will be more effective than Earth\'s), but Thor gets into a fight with Rogers and Tony. The fight ends in a stalemate. Eventually, Loki is taken to the helicarrier and placed in a glass cell designed to hold the Hulk. Fury explains that if Loki attempts to escape, even by merely cracking the glass, a shaft will open below him and he\'ll plummet to Earth and possibly be killed.On board the aircraft carrier, the fully assembled Avengers squad is being briefed by Fury about what they think will possibly happen next. Loki is in prison and is interrogated by Agent Romanoff. Tony Stark arrives and it seems the only one of the group he really gets along with is Bruce Banner. While conducting experiments on Loki\'s scepter, Stark tries to get a rise out of Banner so he can witness Banner\'s famous party trick (read: turning into the Incredible Hulk). Banner flinches and then begins telling about how he\'s been unable to fully harness his abilities and that he suffered depression after the accident. That\'s why he moved to Calcutta, as helping people is what gives his life meaning.The Avengers, now brought together, argue and deliberate over how to approach Loki and the revelation that SHIELD plans to harness the Tesseract\'s power to develop weapons, a discovery made by Rogers. Fury admits that the events in New Mexico a year before (recounted in Thor (2011)) made SHIELD aware of other races on other worlds, some of whom may see Earth as an easy target. Thor is seen asking agent Coulson about what happened to Jane Foster. Coulson tells him that S.H.I.E.L.D. has placed her in their witness protection program and that she\'s in a safe zone in London.The decision was made to produce weapons with the Tesseract as a means of deterrence. As the group argues, Clint Barton and Loki\'s possessed agents attack the helicarrier, disabling one of its engines in flight. While Stark and Rogers attempt to restart the damaged engine, Romanoff tries to prevent Dr. Banner from turning into the Hulk and destroying the ship from inside. Her attempt fails and she\'s chased through the ship until Thor takes up the battle to pacify the beast and manages to fell him briefly with a hit from his hammer, Mjolnir. While fighting Barton, Romanoff slams him into a guard rail, and the blow to the head breaks Loki\'s mind control. After the Hulk falls from the ship, Thor is tricked into Loki\'s holding cell by Loki himself, who has recovered his scepter and releases the cell and allows Thor to plummet. Loki is held at bay briefly by Agent Coulson but is also tricked by one of Loki\'s holographic projections - Coulson is stabbed in the back by the real Loki. Coulson later shoots Loki with a blast from an unidentified weapon, one that harnesses the power of the Destroyer. Coulson dies while Fury tries to save his life. Thor escapes from the cell a split second before it hits the ground. Banner wakes up in his human form after crashing into an abandoned factory.Fury uses Coulson\'s apparent death to motivate the Avengers to work as a team. Stark and Rogers realize that simply defeating them will not be enough for Loki. He needs to overpower them in a very public way so as to validate himself as ruler of Earth. Using a device built by Dr. Selvig, Loki opens a portal to the Chitauri home world over Manhattan, summoning a Chitauri invasion. Once again the group\'s petty differences overshadow their ability to communicate as a team, especially with Banner now missing. While in an argument with Rogers, Tony finally figures out that Loki is a full tilt diva, and that he\'s obviously set up shop at the top of Stark\'s office.Natasha, unfortunately arrives too late just as Dr. Selvig has opened the portal. This unleashes Loki\'s army and all hell breaks loose. The army is massive and they can\'t all fight them off as much as they are entering the earth\'s atmosphere. Tony Stark thankfully shows up, as does Bruce Banner. While fighting, Rogers dispatches NYPD cops to direct citizens into the underground tunnels and sewers. Meanwhile, the Hulk smashes, and Tony arrives at Stark Tower where he attempts to stall Loki with a drink which is used to threaten and intimidate him. As that\'s going on, Tony has JARVIS prepare an under development version of Iron Man called MK18 which is contained in a giant box coded specifically for Tony and has advanced weapons capabilities. Loki refuses to cooperate, saying the destruction will continue as long as the citizens of earth don\'t get that they need to be ruled by him. Loki attempts to take control of Stark by using his scepter on his heart to control his mind, but it fails thanks to Tony\'s somewhat trusty Arc Reactor that keeps him alive.The Avengers rally in defense of New York, but quickly come to the conclusion that they will be overwhelmed as wave after wave of Chitauri descend upon Earth. With help from the reformed Barton, Rogers and Thor evacuate civilians while Dr. Banner transforms into the Hulk and goes after Loki, beating him into submission in Tony Stark\'s penthouse. Romanoff makes her way, with a little help from the Chitauri, to the device that holds the portal open (conveniently located on the roof of the Stark Building) and hits Dr. Selvig over the head, freeing him of Loki\'s control. Dr. Selvig reveals that Loki\'s staff can be used to close the portal.As that\'s happening, Hulk confronts Loki, who refuses to be intimidated by such a beast. As Rogers instructed, Hulk smashes Loki into near oblivion. That allows Romanoff to grab the scepter and head to the roof to shut down the portal. While Romanoff is securing the portal, Stark is securing the perimeter. Meanwhile, with Fury on a conference call to the council, Fury berates the council\'s decision to launch a nuclear missile at Manhattan. Fury tries everything possible to stop the council from launching nukes, even destroying two jets that are taking off from the helicarrier. Unfortunately as he\'s about to fire on a third, it gets away and launches a nuclear weapon.Tony intercepts the missile and he knows exactly where to put it - he flies it into the portal. While in the portal, Stark instructs JARVIS to try Pepper one last time. Unfortunately the call fails as Pepper is on a plane and glued to the TV with other Stark Industries executives. Tony launches the nuke at the Chitauri mothership, completely destroying the invasion. All the invading aliens collapse and are rendered useless. Stark sees the nuke go just as he runs out of oxygen and falls to what appears to be certain doom. Thankfully he manages to escape the portal just as Romanoff is able to successfully close it. Once back in the atmosphere it looks like Tony isn\'t going to make it, but is saved by the Hulk thanks to incredible timing. A dazed Stark, awakened by the Hulk\'s roar, offers to take the team out for shawarma, but they decide to apprehend Loki first. The Avengers go their separate ways. Romanoff, Rogers, and Hawkeye return to working for S.H.I.E.L.D., Tony and Pepper are seen rebuilding Stark Tower and are working on the next phase of the project. Thor escorts Loki and the Tesseract back to Asgard where Loki will stand multiple trials for war crimes from both Asgard and the Chitauri. Meanwhile, multiple TV news reports recap the events surrounding the Avengers, and while they\'ve become worldwide heroes for to some for their efforts in New York, others are fearful and want to know who will take responsibility for the devastation.On another video conference call with the World Security Council, Fury is being congratulated, but they also grill him that now their secret\'s out, this group is too dangerous for the world to handle. And Fury is glad - what happened in New York is a warning. A warning to all galaxies that if they try to attack earth, S.H.I.E.L.D. is there to defend it. And they have just the team. Fury also tells the S.H.I.E.L.D. board that the Avengers\' whereabouts are no longer being tracked. They\'ve earned a leave of absence, but will be called back when needed. He also tells the council that the Tesseract is where no one on earth will ever be able to find it.In a mid-credits scene, the Chitauri leader the Other tells his master that it is futile to attack Earth, as fighting the Avengers is like courting death. His master turns, revealing himself to be Thanos, a worshiper of the personification of Death, smiling at the chance to court her with more loss of life.After further credits, the Avengers are shown eating together in a shawarma joint; the team looks worn out and no one speaks.']"
33,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Iron Man 3,1300854,"['I am sure that ""Iron Man 3"" will make a ton of money and satisfy audiences. But, at the same time, it delivers something that is not the original ""Iron Man""—it\'s got more than the original and so much less. First the more—the film has more stunts, more CGI, more action and more explosions than ever before in the series. If that is what you\'re looking for, then you\'ll no doubt be satisfied. As far as less goes, the film has much less in the way of plot, characters and, especially, fun. Now I am not saying it\'s a bad film—but by this third film in the series (and the fourth appearance by Robert Downey Jr. as the lead) the formula is a bit faded. Good\x85.but faded.By this installment, like his comic book character, Tony is a serious screwball. He rarely sleeps and has significant problems with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. And, at times, he seems more machine than man. Not surprisingly, his personal life is a mess. At the same time, two threats are looming—one by a brilliant but morally suspect inventor (Guy Pearce) and another from a lunatic seemingly modeled after Osama Bin-Laden (Ben Kingsley). While the Pearce plot is much more important to the film, I really liked what they did with Kingsley, as this was an injection of humor—and the film needed all it could get. In fact, Kingsley\'s character and performance is my favorite thing about the movie. Now the cute is isn\'t bad, either, but he did seem a bit like a cliché. The bottom line is that Tony needs to come, once again, to the aid of the world and in the process there are fifty bazillion stunts, explosions, MANY situations in which he could not possibly survive (yet he does\x85which makes little sense) and a lot of 3-D. Now the 3-D portion bothered me, as it really wasn\'t necessary for the film and didn\'t enhance or detract from my viewing at all. If I had the choice, I\'d probably see the normal version simply because it\'s cheaper.Oh, and by the way, where are the great AC/DC tunes? Instead, the soundtrack is okay but features songs by Dwight Yoakim. I am sure Yoakim is a nice guy\x85but he\'s not AC/DC. So, in summary, I wanted more humor, less explosions, more plot and more AC/DC. If we can\'t have that, perhaps this should be the last film in the series—and the end does hint that that COULD be the case\x85.maybe.', ""The first film was great and among the better Marvel films and the second while a step-down did for all the major problems it had did a lot of things right. As unpopular an opinion as this might be, Iron Man 3 was a solid second sequel and a notch better than the second. Yes it is agreed personally that the Mandarin was not very well handled, he could have been better developed and was cheapened by the face-palm inducing plot twist. Don Cheadle and Gwyneth Paltrow are given very little to do to the extent that Cheadle actually is wasted. And Hans Zimmer's score was a disappointment, I like Zimmer but the score was too much of an over-loud drone that was often too in-your-face and there were numerous times when the orchestration didn't fit. Iron Man 3 still does a lot right, it's very expertly made with the best special effects quality of the three films, striking locations and use of gadgets and very stylish cinematography and editing, never showing any signs of drabness, garishness or choppiness. The action sequences have plenty of great spectacle and are very exciting, especially the plane sequence and the explosive climax, that is by far the best climax of the three(the first's was rushed and overblown to me and the second's while an improvement was rather brief and could have started earlier than it did). The script had plenty of breezy black humour, great exuberance and enough surprises that are done smartly and cleverly. You may miss the mix of comic nostalgia and currant relevance that the direction in the previous two films had but the darker, without being overly-serious approach served the grittier-than-usual story here well and Shane Black does show that he is comfortable in action and in the drama and thriller aspects. The story is more involving and far less familiar than that of the second's, the only reservation being the plot-twist for the Mandarin, and doesn't feel cluttered this time round, and emotional impact, tension, fun and coherence are not sacrificed at least. Robert Downey Jnr. mixes brooding intensity and deadpan comic timing adeptly(if not as fresh and powerhouse quality as in the first) and for the villains Ben Kingsley actually plays deceptive quite brilliantly and Guy Pearce is also very effective. The supporting cast are very good on the whole, though the way they're written varies. All in all, not as good as the first Iron Man but a solid second sequel that is not wholly deserving of the dislike/indifference it gets, though the criticisms are valid. 7/10 Bethany Cox"", ""I have to admit that part of my problem with Iron Man 3 is the fact that a neighbor gave me a bad bootleg to review the film. The sound quality was terrible. Still I have to say that the Iron Man franchise seems to be getting a bit rusty.Robert Downey, Jr. is clearly enjoying playing Tony Stark and his super hero persona Iron Man to the hilt. If the money's right and the box office good, no doubt we'll see him again. As no doubt we will girl Friday Pepper Potts, known in the real world as Gwyneth Paltrow.The world of Howard Hughes like industrialist Tony Stark comes crashing around him as a new villain known as the Mandarin does a Pearl Harbor like attack on the home base and Downey barely escapes with his life. No superpowers for the moment, Downey has to resort to wit and wile to stay alive to rescue Paltrow and the President of the United States who looks nothing like Barack Obama.As for the acting Ben Kingsley is hamming it up to beat the band. His performance would win the hog contest at any county fair. But his role isn't exactly Gandhi here. Shades of Fu Manchu in his Mandarin performance.Iron Man 3 is strictly for those of all ages who like comic books."", ""I thought the second IRON MAN film wasn't bad at all, a certain step up from the wonky first instalment, but this third outing for the superhero is one too many. IRON MAN 3 feels like a bloated and superficial comedy with all of Robert Downey Jr.'s annoying wisecracks coming to the fore and not along else.If I had to describe this film in a single word, it would indeed be 'bloated'. The running time is bloated as are the endless CGI action sequences, which go nowhere and add nothing of any entertainment value to the screen. Downey Jr. gives a lazy performance, while the script is even lazier in bumping off key characters only to bring them back five minutes later in supposed 'twists'.My interest was briefly raised by the appearance of Guy Pearce, but even he doesn't seem to be very good here, and the less said about Ben Kingsley's over the top acting the better. If you like childish action, lots of bonding with that annoying kid from JURASSIC WORLD, and a general lack of momentum and direction, then IRON MAN 3 might be the film for you."", ""Iron Man 3 (2013) *** (out of 4) Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) calls out a terrorist known as The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) and soon everything he knows or cares about is in danger. With the help of a special chemical created by a madman (Guy Pearce), the Mandarin plans to destroy the world and take Iron Man out with it. IRON MAN 3 isn't a flawless movie but it's certainly a very entertaining one that packs plenty of punch from the opening sequence to the last. I personally enjoyed the second film in the series, although I'm well aware than many hated it and those same people are calling this one a return to form. Well, this here is certainly a step up from the second film and it almost reaches the level of the first one. I think the greatest thing going for this third film is that it offers up pretty of funny moments. As usual Stark is full of jokes and wise-cracks and of course Downey is just perfect in delivering them. If the first two films didn't already prove it this one here certainly does but Downey was just perfect casting for this character and I can't think of anyone who would have been better. The supporting cast is strong as usual with Kingsley turning in a very good performance as the villain and his voice in the terrorist videos was extremely effective. Both Don Cheadle and Gwyneth Paltrow return and are fun but I can't say the screenplay did either of them any favors. Rebecca Hall, Jon Favreau and Ty Simkins were good and it's always fun seeing Miguel Ferrer. It was especially great seeing Pearce back in a good role and the underrated actor does a very good job with it. The action scenes are all extremely well-done and I thought the CGI was very impressive and mixed in well with the live action. The story itself wasn't the strongest in the world but there's no question that the screenplay got the humor right and it gave us situations and characters that kept us involved. Director Shane Black keeps the film moving at a very fast pace and there's no question that he never lets the viewer doze off or lose interest in what's going on. IRON MAN 3 is certainly a great way to kick off the summer season and it's good to see that three films in (four if you count THE AVENGERS) they're still delivering the goods."", ""Back in 1999, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) meets up with Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall) who is working on her bio project. It would simply be an one night stand and he would also blow off Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce). The two of them would come back to cause trouble in the present. In the present, Stark is haunted by the battle of NY and is suffering sleepless nights and panic attacks. Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) is now CEO. Colonel James Rhodes (Don Cheadle)'s suit has been renamed Iron Patriot. And there is a new terror menace named The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley).I love the fact that Stark is suffering from the battle of NY. The sarcastic humor is funnier than ever. In this one, Stark even picks up a funny boy sidekick. His character is deeper than ever. If there is one problem with the movie, Stark is too often without his suits. It makes the ending less reasonable. But the ending is chalk full of explosive fun, and I'm willing to ignore any minor problems."", ""My goodness. I've just read a series of reviews of this film. I had no idea it was so bad. I guess I'll have to un-enjoy it. Is that a word? I'm just an old guy who likes to go to movies. While I read comic books as a child, I never really let them dictate my very existence. My pain has been watching the Minnesota Vikings for 50 years and having them never win a Super Bowl. The angst over this movie is nearly startling. To make the fact that the studio took liberties with the characters may be disappointing, but the sun will come up tomorrow. I taught literature for over 40 years and I never saw a movie that aligned well with a book. Granted, some movies were actually improvements. Most of the time they were not. Since I didn't know Manderin, I didn't go in thinking he was Iron Man's sworn enemy. The rules were changed and the villains altered. I thought it was a very exciting movie. It had all the cliffhanging events required of an adventure. Special effects allow us a range of spectacle we could not have imagined. Downey and his smug, aloof being are quite delightful. And I felt for the most part that things went as they should. I have seen the other two movies and thought they were also fun. Unlike the fanboys, I don't have the energy to figure out the rule being followed by the players. I need to know how to defeat this guy who has evolved to a horrible force. That is, if you hit him with an i-beam 600 times, which one kills him, or do they kill him? We aren't told. Or are we? Part of any plot or quest is that the hero must face his own shortcomings and rise to the task and (now get this) with knowledge of what it takes, defeat evil. Much like the mercury man in Terminator 3, I was not sure exactly what needed doing; do we melt him, crush him, dismember him, throw him in a pit of molten metal. I don't know. Kind of left me a little cold."", 'It is easy to say than it is the best from the three parts. for story. for the portrait of Tony Stark. and for the not bad image of essence of politic. and, sure, not the last, for fireworks, heroism, dialogues, love story and performances. but the story remains the best thing. defining it not only as a lovely story about humanism and end of a too long age of a sort of Peter Pan.', ""Shane Black enters the The Iron Man franchise as co-writer and director and re-teams with Robert Downey Jr after Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.Black brings a little hard steel to the sometimes silly Iron Man films as well as bringing a more focused mix of action and humour.Once again as it did in the first film we have a plot involving the military-industrial complex and terrorism which fuels it. We have a sinister, almost Osama Bin Laden type bad guy called The Mandarin played by Ben Kingsley whose later reveal as a druggie, out of work actor is rather inspired allowing Kingsley to put on a different more playful performance.Anyone who has seen previous Marvel films and the other Iron Man films could probably work out from the initial scenes who the ultimate baddie will be and along the way you have mayhem, destruction and Stark doing his own 'McGuyver' thing in the middle.This time Stark narrates the ongoing story and you have to wait for the post credits sequence as to who he is narrating the story to and once again Downey is the anchor who drives the film and has made the Iron Man films a success despite its flaws, although this is better than the last one which is a credit to Black."", 'In Malibu, California, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) has insomnia and along 72 hours he develops the new prototype MK42 of the Iron Man armature. He also recalls events in 1999, in Bern, Switzerland, when he had one night stand with the genetic scientist Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall) that was researching a regenerative process and made fun of his fan Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) on the New Year eve. There are explosions in Los Angeles and the terrorist Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) assumes the attempts broadcasting through television. When Tony\'s bodyguard and friend Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) is seriously wounded in an explosion, Tony Stark challenges Mandarin and gives his address to him. However, three helicopters attack his mansion and he loses everything but his prototype, and he awakes in the Tennessee. Tony tries to make work the defective prototype and soon he discovers that the event from 1999 is connected to the present terrorist attacks.""Iron Man 3"" is a disappointing adventure with a silly and forgettable story. The good cast and the top-notch CGI are unable to save this movie and are wasted in a poor screenplay. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Homem de Ferro 3"" (""Iron Man 3"")', 'The superhero blockbuster is a very crowded field and generally one that I now avoid in the cinemas as too often they are not good enough to justify the effort; on DVD at home though, expectations are lower and perhaps they work better even though you lose something of the big screen experience. The Marvel films generally have been the better ones in terms of producing an engaging spectacle which thrills while it makes you laugh and generally encourages you to go along with the plot even though it is very much the stuff of fantasy. If it sounds and looks easy then one just needs to look at the many lesser films that are just a mess of CGI and emptiness.This film sees Stark shut off and struggling with the mental fall-out of The Avengers film and at the same time a terrorist known as The Mandarin is staging attacks globally, building his threats directly at the US President. The plot here is quite a balancing act but it is one that it mostly pulls off. It needs there to be darker moments but for the comedy to still work; it needs there to be a serious ""real world consequences"" plot but for it to still work within the world of fantasy characters. It gets this balance mostly right and I found the film to have a good dark edge to it while ultimately still being funny and having an entertaining flow to it. Some inclusions don\'t work and the villains do feel like a bit of X-files at work, but in terms of providing action, thrills and entertainment, it does a very good job.The cast do well but of course the film is Downey Jr\'s and he does it well despite having more to deliver. His conflicting comedy arrogance and haunted-psyche works pretty, mostly because of his presence and delivery. Paltrow is so-so and she doesn\'t have many times to mix chemistry with the star. Pearce is OK but not given enough time to justify his character but Kingsley is fun in all the different ways he is asked to deliver! Hall, Cheadle, Dale, Sadler and Favreau all give good support but the latter does feel a bit unnecessary.It is still a summer blockbuster, so your sights should be set accordingly, but it is a good one in that it delivers robust entertainment across the board with a nicely dark tone complimenting effects, action sequences and comedy.', 'The first 25 minutes of the film sets it up for the action. We return to 1999 when Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) ignores Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) a young genius in order to spend time with a conquest (Rebecca Hall). Years later a terrorist called Mandarin (Ben Kinsley) appears on TV. Meanwhile Tony is working on a device to call his suit to him. Stark comes under attack as the subplots collide.On the scale of films I rate this above the second feature, but below the first one and ""The Avengers."" In this movie there are references to the Avengers, or ""super friends"" and the worm hole, but they don\'t play a role. There were lines in this film written for us older guys such as ""You like that West World?"" something even the hip youngsters might miss. Iron Man is aided by Don Cheadle and a kid from Tennessee (Ty Simpkins). I was also glad to see Gwyneth Paltrow\'s role expanded.A good one to see on the big screen and a must addition to my Avengers collection.Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.', 'Or OTT as some like to say/write. And it definitely is. This is supposed to be a fun summer movie. That is a concept you have to get your head around. Another one is, that Shane Black is back. And I\'m thankful for that. I was so excited after ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"", but unfortunately it wasn\'t a commercial success. And though he has proved that he has talent (in writing and also in directing, see his biography), it seemed like Hollywood was done with him.Fortunately Robert Downey Jr. comes along and with the power he now has, can say: I want him as director. Not sure if it happened exactly like that, but whatever the circumstances, I\'m glad he is able to do projects now with the Iron Man 3 success backing him up. As for Downey Jr. he seems to be bargaining for a new deal as Mr. Tony Stark. And he probably will get what he wants. Good for him.But what about the movie itself? The action is amazing (budget wise you couldn\'t expect anything less), but there is also a lot of wit in it. The script oozes with clever remarks and great quotes! Trademark Black! There is also clever hints and word plays (concerning the last events of the Avengers that is) and Tony Stark does have another evolution to go through. Great casting and especially great idea with Sir Ben Kingsley. Another ""Black-ish"" element that is added to the mix. Though I have to admit, I\'m not familiar with the characters of the comic itself, I know this movie did what it was supposed to do ... and then some! Let it entertain you!', ""Well Downey made a downer this time. Not that the movie doesn't have it's abundance of excitement and over the top action, but story wise, the film left a lot to be desired. I'm still thinking about the plot that introduced the Islamic looking Chinese villain called The Mandarin. The set up would have you believe that there really was such a character, but the reveal when Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) makes his secret known, all I could do was go 'huh'? I thought the Ben Kingsley charade would wind up amounting to something, but that was not to be. Instead, The Mandarin was a molten lava man who's evil power seemed to be making things hot. Rather feeble now that I think about it.And what's with all the Iron Man suits? And why did they all break apart so easily? Now the psychic link between Tony Stark (Downey) and his armor was a cool idea, but some of the stunts they put the Iron Man suit through was a bit much. It got a little over done after a while and began to look monotonous. And if they're going to have Don Cheadle employ the War Machine gig again, at least give him something to do. In the climactic battle scene, he seemed to be more of an observer than a forceful participant.I liked a few things, like the Barrel O' Monkeys stunt, and the humor was generally well placed, but this Iron man doesn't measure up to the first two. Then when Tony ditched the chest thingie at the end, I had to wonder how Iron Man was going to get back in action with the Avengers. I'm sure they'll figure it out, but why jump through those hoops when you don't have to. Even the after credits clip seemed disjointed and didn't offer the usual inducement to make your mouth water for the next Marvel flick. These guys have to come up with some better ideas."", 'By now the string of superhero movies is REALLY getting stale. It was OK to see the X-Men, Spider-Man, the Hulk and Iron Man once each. Each one has his/her own superpower and has to use it in his/her own way. But it gets boring when each movie has two or three sequels. Seriously, how many bad guys are you going to defeat? I can think of stories that haven\'t gotten filmed, but Hollywood is stuck on superhero sequels, tween pop, and remakes of horror flicks and foreign films*. Therefore, ""Iron Man 3"" just doesn\'t seem original. It especially comes across as a letdown when you consider that Robert Downey Jr. has starred in ""Chaplin"" and ""Good Night and Good Luck"". I don\'t recommend this movie.*I can proudly say that I\'ve seen ""Solaris"", ""Open Your Eyes"", ""The Dinner Game"" and ""Death at a Funeral"", but not their American remakes.', 'Stark\'s experiences during the alien invasion of New York are giving him panic attacks. Restless, he has built several dozen Iron Man suits, creating friction with his girlfriend Pepper Potts. Meanwhile, a string of bombings by a terrorist known only as the Mandarin has left intelligence agencies bewildered by a lack of forensic evidence.Todd McCarthy wrote, ""After nearly crashing and burning on his last solo flight in 2010, Iron Man returns refreshed and ready for action in this spirited third installment... that benefits immeasurably from the irreverent quicksilver humor of co-writer and director Shane Black."" This is spot on. Black brings a sensibility to the table that is perfect for Tony Stark, and recalls the days when Black was writing witty banter for Mel Gibson in ""Lethal Weapon"".', ""The first film was really good, the second film was a tiny bit of a let down, but I heard this third film was an improvement, and I saw that it was rated well by the critics, so I went to the cinema to see it, from director Shane Black (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang). Basically the film starts with a flashback to a New Years Eve party in 1999 where Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) was with female scientist Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall), who invented the experimental regenerative treatment called Extremis, which intended to recover severely injured people. At the party Tony was invited by disabled and nerdy looking scientist Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce), who owns company Advanced Idea Mechanics (AID), to have a place in the company, but he rejects the offer, and saying he would meet him later leaves him humiliated. Forwarding to the present day, Tony is still recovering from the events during the alien invasion in New York (during Avengers Assemble) and having panic attacks, so he has built several Iron Man suits to relieve himself, but this is also creating friction between him and his girlfriend Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow). Meanwhile a series of bombings by a terrorist called The Mandarin (Sir Ben Kingsley) with no forensic evidence left behind at the scenes has left intelligence agencies bewildered, but when Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau), security chief of Stark Industries, is injured, that is when Tony threatens the terrorist on television. Tony says for the Madarin to come and get him, he is later visited by Hansen who comes to warn him of danger, and the terrorist responds to the televised threat by sending helicopter gunships to destroy the Stark house, but he saves Hansen and Pepper from the attack. Escaping the attack in one of his suits Tony blacks out and crashes somewhere in Tennessee, where a bombing took place, following the crash the suit or experimental armour has no sufficient power to get him back to California, and everyone believes that he is dead. He gets help from ten year old Harley Keener (Ty Simpkins) in investigating the incident in the town, the explosion has all the similarities to a Mandarin attack, and he deduces from his technological thinking that soldiers subjected to Extremis have reacted badly to the effects and it caused them to explode, he witnessed this with agents Ellen Brandt (Stephanie Szostak) and Eric Savin (James Badge Dale) attacking him. With the boy's help Tony traces the location of the Mandarin to Miami, but meeting the dangerous looking man from television Tony is surprised that he is actually a British born actor named Trevor Slattery, the Mandarin is a creation of the true villain, now good looking and Extremis cured Killian. When Tony is captured by Killian, the villain tells him that he has kidnapped Pepper, and that she has been subjected to Extremis as a blackmail to force him to help the improve the effects of the experiment, Hansen is killed for having a change of heart, and Colonel James Rhodes (Don Cheadle), formerly War Machine now re-branded as the Iron Patriot, is lured into a trap to steal his armour. Tony manages to escape and help Rhodes, he knows that the plan by Killian is to use and control the Iron Patriot suit to attack President Ellis (William Sadler) aboard Air Force One, so the two heroes head for the impounded damaged oil tanker where the villain is hiding out. Going against the numerous henchmen Tony activates all of his suits, and controlled by JARVIS (voiced by Paul Bettany) they fight the thugs, while Rhodes rescues the President, before saving Pepper who has survived the Extremis effects. Killian is trapped in one of the Iron Man suits to be self destroyed, but this fails to kill him, but Pepper intervenes with her newfound powers and he is killed, and to prove his dedication to her Tony orders JARVIS to destroy all the armour suits, the shrapnel embedded in his heart is removed in surgery, and he throws his obsolete chest arc reactor into the sea, but remarks he will always be Iron Man. Also starring Ashley Hamilton as Jack Taggert, Dale Dickey as Mrs. Davis, Miguel Ferrer as Vice President Rodriguez, Xueqi Wang as Doctor Wu, Shaun Toub as Ho Yinsen, Bill Maher, Joan Rivers, Stan Lee as Pageant Judge and Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner in a post credits sequence. Downey Jr. is still likable being knowledgeable and jokey, Pearce is a great choice as the knowingly nasty villain, Kingsley is great being deceptive and amusing, and supporting cast members Paltrow and Cheadle get their good moments as well. The story is much better worked out than the previous, the fight and destruction sequences are engaging, especially the house attack and final fight, the special effects are really cool with all the suits in action, technological gadgets and explosions, there is plenty of fun to be had with this terrific fantasy action adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects. Very good!"", ""Opening with a flashback to 1999 we see a pre-Iron Man Tony Stark meeting scientist Maya Hansen; she is developing an experimental process that if it works will ultimately help people recover from serious injuries. A test involving a plant is shown to have the possibility of explosive failure. The two of them are approached by Aldrich Killian, another scientist, who wants Tony to work with his company; an offer he rejects.Cutting forward to the current day a terrorist known as 'The Mandarin' is targeting American interests around the world; the attacks have one strange thing in common; an explosion but no sign of a bomb. Tony is currently working on yet another Iron Man suit while still troubled by the 'events in New York'. He issues a threat to the Mandarin, including telling him where he lives. Soon afterwards Maya visits Tony at home but the building is destroyed by attack helicopters. She and Pepper Potts survive the attack while Tony is reported dead\x85 however he has managed to fly to Tennessee where he starts investigating an explosion that matches the pattern of the other attacks but wasn't connected. Here he is helped by a young boy and meets some people with a strange ability; they can raise their bodies to temperatures that can melt metal. Soon afterwards it becomes apparent that Killian is behind the Mandarin and inevitably he has further plans.This is a solid third instalment In the Iron Man franchise although it follows on from 'The Avengers' with references to 'events in New York'\x85 there is no recap of what happened so if, like me, you haven't seen that film you may be a bit confused\x85 you just have to accept that something bad happened and now Tony Stark has PTSD or something similar. I've not read the original comics so can't comment on how this handled the characters compared to the source material but I thought they were pretty solid; I particularly liked Ben Kingsley's portrayal of 'The Mandarin' and really enjoyed the twist regarding his character. Guy Pearce was good as Killian although the character was a bit cliché\x85 as soon as Tony Stark rejected his approach in the prologue it was obvious that he'd return as the bad guy. Rebecca Hall was also good as Maya, one of the film's most 'normal' characters. The returning cast Robert Downey Jr, Gwyneth Paltrow and Don Cheadle are as good as one would expect. The story was solid and provided plenty of excuses for some spectacular action which feature top-notch special effects. Inevitably there are some weaker moments and I could have done without Tony getting help from a kid but overall I'd say this is a fun superhero movie that fans of the franchise are likely to enjoy."", 'As I am not overly much fan of superheroes, then the ""Iron Man"" movies so far have been quite entertaining as it is not really a superhero as per se.This third installment of the ""Iron Man"" movies is fast paced and action packed right from the very beginning, and the movie just grips your with an iron fist, pardon the pun, and just never lets go. The movie explodes in a fast pace of action and adrenaline, and there never really is a dull moment throughout the entire movie.It was really nice to see the Tony Stark character evolving away from the stereotypical cocky playboy type that he was in the first two movies. Sure, that trait is still there, but it is more toned down now and giving way for a whole new aspect of the character. And Robert Downey Jr. does embrace this change quite well and bring is nicely to life on the screen. And these panic attacks that Stark were having were really a great touch to the character, given the aftermath of what happened in ""The Avengers"". Thumbs up for this path of developing the Stark character.The story in ""Iron Man 3"" is about a terrorist known only as The Mandarin who has an agenda against the Unites States of America, and when Stark openly challenges the terrorist before all the media, Stark finds himself in over his head as his world is literally brought down. Past opportunities have come back and are more potent and dangerous now, threatening to obliterate Stark and Iron Man all together.Storywise, the ""Iron Man 3"" is just as exciting as the first two movies. And the effects were off the charts, as they were in the previous movies as well. Everything here is really done so nicely, and I personally loved the variation of details and design we got to see on all the various versions of the Iron Man suits.The cast, as usual, did a great job, and Robert Downey Jr. did carry the movie once again.However, I didn\'t really care much for the villain and the powers that he had. I just had a hard time wrapping my head around how one would be able to superheat one\'s body to melt metal and cause no harm to the flesh of their own body. By altering the DNA codes apparently, as it was put in the movie. Sure, it looked cool and had some nice effects, but it was just a little bit too far fetched to buy into. And honestly, when Aldrich Killian (played by Guy Pearce) breathed fire, I was ready to get up and turn off the movie - it was just too much. Luckily I didn\'t, otherwise I would have missed out on one amazing action movie.""Iron Man 3"" is well worth a watch if you enjoy action and/or superhero movies. Lots of actions, great acting, good character development, cool special effects and witty humor from Stark.', ""So often, the third movie in a blockbuster series such as this proves to be a disappointment, but I found Iron Man 3 to be just as entertaining as the previous two films, if not more so. It's full on entertainment, pure and simple, packed with stunning effects laden set-pieces, loaded with great performances from a cast who know not to take matters too seriously, and bristling with snappy dialogue.Most importantly, perhaps, it's laugh out loud funny, which, in turn, means it's a lot more fun overall than many a recent superhero movie. I came out of this one feeling like I had seen a real comic-book brought to life rather than something masquerading as meaningful and thought provoking (The Dark Knight trilogy, I'm talking about you!). The film's light-hearted moments also make it much easier to accept the more outlandish sequences, which is a good job because the mayhem here is turned up to eleven, with more crash, bang and wallop for your money than ever before.I do, however, have one gripe with part three: the ending suggests that they might not be making a part four. As far as I am concerned, they could keep on making Iron Man movies indefinitely just so long as they are as enjoyable as this one.8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb."", ""Robert Downey Jr. is one of those actors that I just like to see in movies. No matter what the role I find him entertaining with his mix of serious and funny. To me he is what makes this a good movie. Here he is back as Tony Stark, the wealthy inventor who made the first Iron Man suit while imprisoned in Afghanistan. (The movie does a very brief review of that.) He lives in a futuristic looking house that almost resembles a space ship, on a high bluff overlooking the Pacific Ocean. This is an important fact, since one scene features the very graphic destruction of his house after he challenges the bad guys and gives out his address. But that gets a bit ahead of the story.There is a new terrorist and he is bent on destroying the USA and its President. We see him in videos patched into regular TV programming feeds. He says he can't be stopped, he will always be ahead of his pursuers. Of course Iron Man Stark vows to find him and kill him. And that is what sparked his perhaps rash decision to give his exact address, although I don't think it would have been hard to find anyway. But it makes for a story element.Gwyneth Paltrow is back as his love interest Pepper Potts, and Don Cheadle is back as Colonel James Rhodes who also uses one of the iron suits to fight crime.The bad guy, no pun intended, turns out to be Guy Pearce as Aldrich Killian, someone who knew Stark back in 1999, and in the years since, along with his partner in crime, Rebecca Hall as Maya Hansen, had developed a technology that was imperfect, sometimes it caused the person to explode, and that is why they could not find bomb or explosive fragments at the terrorist bombing sites.So the story comes down to a contest between Stark and Killian, both capable fighters, to see if Iron Man can save the world yet again.SPOILERS: The man they saw on TV as the terrorist was Ben Kingsley, who played an actor named Trevor Slattery, hired by Killian and dressed in beard and Eastern garb, to disguise the fact that the real terrorists were scientists. With even more battles and destruction Stark finally gets rid of Killian, it seems, although maybe they were setting the stage for a sequel. Just entertaining fluff, lots of action. I never expected to see William Sadler as a President, but there he was as President Ellis."", 'Iron Man \'Three\'. I want to write about this before the general thoughts: by now you may know the ""twist"", but why even say that? The entertainment comes from going in cold, after all, and it\'s the kind of thing that has drawn audiences down in a polar sort of way. You find out what is really going on with a character, and it... is hilarious. For me. It does something different, it alters the expectations that come with such a blockbuster that delivers the same-old same-old, and most of all, the filmmakers understand that they can make a point here too, as Iron Man did in 2008: a little statement about the world we\'re living in, in that case it was the militarization of the third world, and here it\'s media manipulation. It doesn\'t over-do it; and the actor\'s revelation is just splendid. I can see why it\'d p-off some folks though, especially if you really really really wanted to see this particular character.This would be higher up on the list of Marvel movies in general, except for one really irksome character flaw at the end. What is an otherwise highly entertaining and smashingly-though-darkly absurd climactic battle on a bunch of naval ships, which is that Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) decides to blow up his remaining suits. It seemed like such a needless act, even for the likes of Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), especially as we in the audience know how many more times Stark will return in the suit in future films (whether it\'s *only* Avengers 2 or other films, it\'s not a question of if but how much).And yet, aside from this, it\'s a fun summer movie that takes some real chances – Ben Kingsley, nuff said – and always keeps its heart in the right place as Stark, who faces some big risks with the likes of the Mandarin and Guy Pearce\'s Killian, doesn\'t stop for a sarcastic barb, a moment of self-conscious knowing, and Black as writer/director keeps the action, humor, thrills, and spectacle moving at an intelligent, coherent clip, not to mention Downey, who fills the role and conflicts of Stark with bravura as always. It was the only summer blockbuster I could stand seeing more than once (though I really tried for another HUGE spectacle, which we\'ll get to in a moment).', ""When I watched this third Iron Man movie with my movie theatre-working friend and his relatives, I had only previously seen the first one so it's possible I was partially confused by some of the characterizations that were portrayed in this entry in the series because of my not seeing the second one yet. Still, I did like many of the action scenes and some of the humor presented here as well as some of the twists concerning some villains and the fate of Pepper Potts. And Robert Downey Jr. is both intense and fun when playing the charismatic Tony Stark with Gwyneth Paltrow still bringing sparks as his loving partner, the aforementioned Ms. Potts. So on that note, I highly enjoyed watching Iron Man Three."", 'This film is about Tony Stark investigating a series of explosions without traces of explosives.""Iron Man 3"" is very good! The plot is great, well developed and paced. Unlike other recent blockbusters, there is a good mix of action and comedy, and more importantly the plot makes sense and makes you beg for more. It is refreshing to see a superhero with goofy moments and even anxiety attacks, reminding us that no one is perfect. The special effects are extremely fast, everything looks so real and convincing. The mid-air rescue scene is so breathtaking and beautiful, I could not take my eyes off the screen. I really enjoyed watching ""Iron Man 3"". And remember to stay until after the credits, when you will see Mark Ruffalo in a cameo scene.', ""I'm surprised that Downey has held out this long. At some point, you have enough money and want to return to your art. He says this is his last, and I believe him. What we have in this case is him on his way out, dictating terms. And we have a pretty good movie as a result, far better that the earlier ones and leagues better than the usual Marvel.He booted out the director and got the guy he worked with on Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. That film found a distance between noir detective movies and self-satire that was novel, delicious. It is carried over to here. No one but kiddies can take these movies seriously, so the game is to find that space in between the world you show and the world of the viewer. Usually it has to be reflectively comic. Guardians used that effectively. What we have here is more subtle, letting the genre itself be the joke. It isn't just that the villain is an actor; the idea permeates the whole world.He booted out the writer and got the hot new guy, someone who understands snappy situations and narrative distance. He'll probably burn out, but here he matters.He changed the formula from girl-in-distress to give Pepper some kickass scenes. And finally, he fired ILM and got WETA. So we now have some sense of spatial imagination and adventure where before we had dull bombast.This adds up to a great deal of fun for me. Sure, there are a lot of things that don't make sense and are pretty dull, but they are in different places and ways than with the usual Marvel product. You can't eliminate these, but shifting them is novel, competent, self-aware and appreciated.If he leaves the franchise, he will have done so with some honor, and some demonstration that he knows what he is doing. Bless you Mr. Downey."", 'The movie opens with Tony (Robert Downey Jr.) narrating a story about how we create our own demons. In a flashback to New Year\'s Eve 1999, Tony, meets a botanical scientist named Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall) in Bern, Switzerland, and arrogantly avoids crippled nerdy scientist Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce), who wants Tony\'s backing in his endeavor, Advanced Idea Mechanics (AIM). Maya has an experimental plant. Maya has been working on experimental (and in some cases unethical) biological research in plants that causes their DNA to change drastically and has the power to cure incurable diseases and paralysis.In December 2012, it has been quite some time after the events of New York City and the Avengers Initiative (from \'The Avengers\') when Iron Man/Tony Stark saved New York. A haunted Tony Stark has obsessively built several Iron Man suits in his mansion. Tony works on a new model, the Mark 42, which is modular; all the suit pieces fly to him and recombine. The first attempt at making the MK42 work is met with a funk version of ""Jingle Bells"" with Tony dancing while the pieces are coming at him. As per the course, Tony of course completely ignores any safety measures that JARVIS takes. It ends rather poorly when Tony is thrown across the room attempting flight with the MK42 and it shatters into pieces. JARVIS of course gloats with an ""I told you so"" moment.Tony then continues his story about creating demons. He then talks about how he turned on the TV to find a new terrorist at work called ""The Mandarin"" (Ben Kingsley). The Mandarin hijacks American airwaves and makes his American debut by taking credit for the bombing of a US military station in Kuwait that killed the wives and children of soldiers out on maneuvers. President Ellis\'s initial response to the Mandarin however makes him the butt of the jokes of late night talk show hosts: It seems the only thing that he\'s able to come up with is to take the MK8, the suit worn by Colonel James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) and formerly known as ""War Machine"" and have it repainted, rebranded, and reintroduced as ""The Iron Patriot"".Tony later asks Rhodes in a restaurant what\'s really going on with the Mandarin. Rhodes tells Tony that while the media and the press only know of three bombings attributed to the Mandarin, there have been at least six more that have taken place off the books. Rhodes explains that he\'s now operating MK8 as the ""Iron Patriot"" (formerly known as War Machine). While the two are coming to an agreement that the name chosen was horrible, Tony is confronted by a group of kids who want his autograph. Tony jokes that the boy looks very much like Ralphie from A Christmas Story. The girl asks how Tony was able to escape the worm hole in New York, causing him to freak out. Tony makes a B-line for his Iron Man suit and enters, JARVIS explains that Tony is suffering a massive anxiety attack.Back at Stark Industries, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) goes to meet her 4:00 appointment. The appointment is Aldrich Killian, who has improved his condition; he\'s in much better physical shape and his disability seems to be completely gone. Aldrich wants Stark Industries\' backing in his think tank called ""Advanced Idea Mechanics"". AIM\'s goal is a biological experiment called ""Extremis"" which harnesses\' the brain\'s power to alter human DNA. He then shows Pepper a large holographic reconstruction of his brain and how Extremis can utilize parts of the brain that would otherwise go unused. Pepper tells Aldrich that Stark Industries isn\'t interested in funding AIM because the ideas could be translate into human weapons.Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) has found a new career as the head of security at Stark Industries although he\'s annoying nearly 99% of the company\'s personnel and visitors with his penchant for requiring everybody to wear badges. Pepper explains that complaints against him have risen nearly 200% since he started working there (which Happy takes as a compliment).Pepper drives home and Tony has a huge stuffed bunny for her as her Christmas gift. However, he is busy working and Pepper isn\'t greeted by Tony, but by another remote-controlled prototype of the Iron Man suit, leaving Pepper upset. Tony has developed a heads-up-display (HUD) and is using it as a remote control. That night while asleep, Tony experiences PTSD-induced trauma about what happened in New York. They\'re then startled when one of the new prototype Iron Man suits is awakened and has made its\' way into the bedroom. Tony then immediately dismantles it. A frustrated Pepper tells Tony that she\'s going to sleep downstairs and has him ""tinker with that"" after he explains to Pepper that he\'s been a complete mess since the events in New York and has been unable to sleep.The next day Happy follows one of Killian\'s men, Eric Savin (James Badge Dale), to the Grauman\'s Chinese Theater. Savin gives another man, Jack Taggart, a briefcase. Happy tries to intercede but is beaten senseless by Savin, and seconds later, Taggart overheats and explodes, leaving behind only his old dog tags. Happy is severely injured, while Savin walks away. Hours later, the Mandarin hijacks the TV airwaves to take responsibility for the blast.Tony is now furious over Happy, who has been left comatose by the bombing. After visiting the hospital to check on Happy, and to make sure that all of the hospital employees were wearing badges while in Happy\'s room (not to mention make sure that the TV is playing Downton Abbey (2010), Happy\'s favorite show), Tony is mobbed by reporters. One of them blatantly asks if Tony is going to kill this guy. A frustrated Tony then asks the reporters if that\'s what they really want, then issues his threat to the Mandarin saying that he just died and gives his home address on TV, egging on the Mandarin to carry out an attack on his home and that he\'ll be ready. Tony then angrily destroys the reporter\'s tape recorder and tells the mob of reporters to bill him.While at home, Tony has JARVIS bring up a hologram diagram of the destruction at Grauman\'s Chinese Theater. While JARVIS is analyzing the attack, Tony discovers that Happy is pointing to a curious oddity of military dog tags with the name ""Jack Taggart"" etched onto them. Since there was no active military personnel at the blast, Tony wonders exactly what the dog tags are doing there. JARVIS then analyzes the latest Mandarin attack and compares with past incidents. This blast at the theater bears resemblance to an incident that happened four years ago in Rose Hill, Tennessee, and predates any known Mandarin attack, where an ex-army soldier named Chad Davis blew himself up, taking five people with him. Tony asks JARVIS if he\'s ever been to Tennessee. JARVIS then creates a flight path for the Iron Man suit.He\'s interrupted when the doorbell rings. A paranoid Tony wonders why he\'s getting visitors since he told JARVIS that the house is on complete and total lock down. The visitor turns out not to be the Mandarin, but Dr. Maya Hansen, who believes Tony is in danger. A freaked out Pepper is arguing with Maya and just as that\'s happening, the house is attacked by three helicopter gunships disguised as news choppers. Tony commands the MK42 suit to cover and protect Pepper. Pepper and Maya survive the attack. Tony gets the MK42 back and manages to destroy two of the helicopters, but down on power he cannot fly. The house crumbles into the sea, taking Tony with it. The suit regains some power and flies off, unseen. Tony passes out.Sometime later, Tony awakens in the suit when JARVIS sets off the low battery alarm. He then sees he\'s plummeting towards the ground and crashes into a snowy forest at full speed. Initially, he thinks he\'s in Northern California, but JARVIS informs him that he\'s actually five miles outside of Rose Hill, Tennessee. Tony is exasperated, but JARVIS reminds him that he asked for a flight plan to be made. With no more power, JARVIS shuts itself down.Tony trudges through the snow, dragging the MK42 along with him. He stops at a gas station, where he uses a payphone to call Pepper, then steals a Poncho off a cigar store mannequin.Tony then drags the MK42 to a seemingly empty house nearby. Inside, he immediately begins work on repairing the MK42. But the house isn\'t empty. It\'s occupied by a lonely 10 year old kid named Harley Keener (Ty Simpkins), who is stunned to find Tony working in his garage. Tony asks Harley for some help and promises that he\'ll be rewarded later on if he gets the help he needs. Harley tells Tony that the world thinks he\'s dead after the attack on his mansion. Tony calls himself ""The Mechanic"" and Harley asks Tony one question too many about the events in New York City, causing Tony to have another anxiety attack.Back at the remains of Tony\'s destroyed Malibu mansion, Pepper is searching for any clues to find out whether or not Tony\'s still alive. Thankfully she is able to retrieve a voice message left from Tony recorded after the attack that proves that he is alive. A relieved Pepper then seeks answers. Tony, working with Harley, assumes that Harley is being bullied at school because Harley keeps making harmless weapons to defend himself with, like a potato gun. Tony finally manages to get JARVIS back online thanks to a HUD display that he developed several months prior to the bombing.Teaming with Harley, Tony investigates the remains of the Mandarin-esque suicide bombing. Harley tells Tony about all the rumors surrounding the attack and the ""soldier"" in question. Tony notices that there are five shadows on a concrete wall, from the five victims who were killed along with Chad Davis.Tony then meets with Davis\'s mother at a bar, where he notices she\'s expecting someone and has a file on hand. He is about to ask her more questions when one of Killian\'s agents, Ellen Brandt, shows up and suddenly cuffs Tony. She poses as a Homeland Security agent to explain her actions to the sheriff, but when he starts asking her for identification, she shoots him. Tony manages to escape the bar, only to be cornered by Savin. He manages to defeat Brandt by luring her into a room where he\'s opened a gas line, and heats up Davis\'s dog tags in a microwave. The explosion throws Brandt into a telephone line and electrocutes her. Savin tries to take Harley hostage, but Harley overpowers him, allowing Tony to grab his car keys and escape.Tony drives off in Savin\'s car. While he drives, the Mandarin hijacks the airwaves once more and explains that he\'s going to brutally murder the CEO of a major oil company on live television if the president doesn\'t contact them within a specific time frame. Despite the President making the phone call, the Mandarin carries out the shooting, warning that the President is his next target.Tony calls Rhodes, who has managed to locate what they think is the Mandarin. Rhodes takes his suit to the Middle East. There, he is shocked to find nothing but an abandoned warehouse which doesn\'t have a single trace of the Mandarin. He also finds that the file he got in Rose Hill is a document from Advanced Idea Mechanics, Killian\'s company.Back in Tennessee, Tony drives to a nearby beauty pageant, and sneaks into one of the camera crew vans so he can research the data on the documents he\'s found. Fortunately for Tony, the van is being operated by one of Tony\'s biggest fans, who even goes so far as to have Iron Man\'s likeness tattooed on his arm - though rather unrecognizable. Tony hacks into AIM\'s servers and finds video footage that sheds new light on what is going on: the bombs are the work of soldiers from the Extremis program, an experimental treatment intended to allow its users to recover from crippling injuries like amputations. However, if a user\'s body cannot properly metabolize Extremis, the user\'s body heats to an extreme temperature and explodes. After veterans started growing unstable and exploding, their deaths were used to cover up Extremis\' flaws by manufacturing a terrorist plot. The test footage shows that a number of early subjects were killed because of Extremis\'s flaws.Rhodes tracks the Mandarin\'s IP address and is led to a sweat shop in the Middle East. But it turns out to be a trap; one of Killian\'s agents disarms him and knocks him unconscious. Killian\'s men steal Rhodes\' suit.Tony uses the IP address that the Mandarin has been using to hijack American airwaves and traces him to Miami, Florida. Tony infiltrates the estate headquarters using a variety of home-made weapons fashioned from stuff bought at a hardware store, Harley\'s trade mark potato gun, and a limited edition Dora the Explorer watch belonging to Harley\'s unseen sister.Inside he discovers the Mandarin is actually a flighty British actor named Trevor Slattery (Ben Kingsley), who is oblivious to the acts the Mandarin has carried out. When confronted, Slattery manages to tell both Tony and Rhodes that he\'s the Mandarin, and manages to completely annoy them both, and Tony goes to confront Killian, while Rhodes stays behind and tries to get any information he can out of the completely clueless Slattery. Tony is captured by some of Killian\'s henchmen - who are also Extremis experiments, and Maya reveals she was working with Killian all along. She thinks Tony can help perfect the Extremis DNA. Aldrich arrives and reveals he has kidnapped Pepper and subjected her to Extremis, intending to infuse her with superhuman abilities and turn her against Tony as leverage to gain Tony\'s aid in fixing Extremis\' flaws. Aldrich then shoots and kills Maya.Tony, strapped to a bed frame by two of Killian\'s men, escapes by summoning the MK42 suit from Tennessee, piece by piece, and reunites with Rhodes on the estate, discovering that Aldrich intends to attack President Ellis aboard Air Force One.Unfortunately the MK42 has yet to regain full flight power. Savin boards the President\'s plane wearing the Iron Patriot suit, shoots the Secret Service agents aboard and takes the President. Savin then blows holes in the airliner body and survivors fall out. Iron Man kills Savin and manages to rescue the falling people by using a small electrical current to hold them all together. When he lands on a nearby bridge, the suit is hit by a large truck and breaks into its components, revealing Tony had been controlling it remotely. Meanwhile the Iron Patriot suit flies away with the President on board. Tony and Rhodes trace Aldrich to an impounded oil drilling platform where Aldrich intends to kill Ellis on live television. The Vice President will become a puppet leader, following Aldrich\'s orders in exchange for Extremis to cure a little girl\'s disability.Rhodes tracks the President to a massive ship yard at Miami\'s port. Tony enacts a new strategy, and has JARVIS enact the ""House Party Protocol"" which unleashes a massive army of Iron Man suits - each one different from the next. On the platform, Tony goes to save Pepper, and Rhodes saves the President. Tony discovers Pepper has survived the Extremis procedure. However, before he can save her, a container crane rig collapses around them and she falls 200 feet to her apparent death. Tony is forced into confronting Aldrich using several suits and finally traps him in the 42 suit that self-destructs. But, a glowing Aldrich survives and staggers toward a defenseless Stark. Killian tells Tony that the Mandarin was made up, that he is the Mandarin and that all attacks were taken out by Extremis experiments. Pepper shows up with Extremis powers and finishes off the weakened Aldrich.After the battle, Tony orders JARVIS to implement ""Clean Slate Protocol"" which destroys each remaining Iron Man suit remotely, as a sign of his intention to devote more time to Pepper. The Vice President and Slattery are arrested. In a voiceover Tony mentions Pepper is cured and Tony himself undergoes surgery to remove the shrapnel embedded near his heart, eliminating the need for his chestpiece to control it. He pitches his obsolete chest arc reactor into the sea, muses he will always be Iron Man, even without his armor. He gathers some scrap parts from his house wreckage and drives off in his Audi eTron. He then leaves Harley with a rebuilt lab and new version of Harley\'s trademark potato gun, telling him that Iron Man will be back and leaves a thank you note from ""The Mechanic"".In a post-credits scene, it is revealed that Stark has been recounting his experiences to Dr. Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo, uncredited), who awakens, having fallen asleep at the beginning of Tony\'s story, followed by the words ""Tony Stark will return"".']"
34,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Thor: The Dark World,1981115,"['The acting was solid. The production value was superb. Everything else was really poor.The back story and character motivations are laughably sparse. Most of the characters are completely one-dimensional, with the possible exception of Loki. The plot is the most boring and typical of all action plots - some ""bad dudes who happen to be really ugly"" decide to ""destroy the world for no reason other than being evil"" and ""only our hero can save us all"", etc. Moreover, it was lazy writing - whenever an absolute miracle needed to happen, it conveniently did, every time. Of course this is a mindless blockbuster Marvel movie so we shouldn\'t expect much. But the thing is that these kinds of films CAN be made with a reasonable plot, pacing, and character development. The writers were obviously just going through the motions to cash in on the surefire moneymaker sequel, and from a business perspective it is hard to fault them. But it says a lot about the sad state of Hollywood in 2013 that this film currently has a 7.7 on IMDb.', 'Is this a huge stepup from the original ""Thor"" movie. No, unfortunately not. Is it another watchable, fun superhero movie; yes, definitely. It\'s a really good movie and if we look at the way Alan Taylor directs this movie, it\'s actually not that much different from what Branagh did back in 2011. Chris Hemsworth is good as usual and Tom Hiddleston is more wonderful than ever as Loki, but the villain Malekith, played by Christopher Eccleston, unfortunately, is a bit of a disappointment, mostly because of the lack of motivation.', ""Let me start by saying that I don't hate superhero films. I like them very much when they are done well. I hate laziness in films and superficiality. The problem is that pretty much every superhero film made is very lazy and most of them are entirely superficial. Marvel's initial idea of an Avengers universe was inspired from a marketing stand point but I am beginning to question whether or not it has been a failure from a creative stand point. 'Thor the Dark World' is a terrible movie. It does absolutely nothing to add to the mythos of the character or this Marvel universe. The only reason it exists is to draw up excitement for the next Avengers film. There are no stakes to this film and there are a lot of places to direct blame. The acting aside from Tom Hiddleston is next to unwatchable. The thing is that this is a very talented cast we are working with here. Anthony Hopkins and Natalie Portman have both won Academy Awards. Stellan Skarsgard is one of the most fascinating character actors in Hollywood. I like Hemsworth a lot too and thought he was great in the first 'Thor' film. But none of them invest anything in the material. Hopkins looks bored and emotes nothing in his delivery. Portman's performance is terrible too and in the process of it being terrible it makes a terrible script look even worse. Jane Foster is a horrible character here. She is by far the stupidest damsel in distress portrayed in comic books recently. Portman is too lazy to give her any sort of character. She punctuates every cheap joke and many of them are just about how ditsy the character is. This kind of writing and performance make me almost agree that comic books offer a flawed and stereotypical depiction of women. Stellan Skarsgard, an actor I think has great depth, is played as a complete fool here. I hated every time he appeared on screen and I am a Stellan Skarsgard fan. I don't place the blame all on him but yeah everyone here did something very wrong in bringing these stupidly conceived characters to life.In actuality though they are not the biggest problem with the film. The problem is that there is no threat to anything or anyone. The villain here is so completely forgettable and has a plan for evil so half assed that they movie really had no chance of working. This is the ultimate example of a conflict for the sake of having a conflict. If actor Christopher Eccleston is not rewarded a Razzie for his portrayal here than that award show has lost all credibility. Villains even poorly written ones with no motivation like this Maleketh should at least offer the actor the chance to try to ham it up with the tropes of goofy villainy. Eccleston doesn't do that. He has a boring calm delivery that evokes no response but laughter. And since Eccleston's performance is such an overwhelming failure I was drawn to how stupid his make-up looked too. I wish I could give this a bomb rating, I really do. To be honest though Tom Hiddleston is too damn good in the Loki role to say the film is completely without merit. They don't do anything new with his character here but he's so entertaining and in every Marvel film he adds new layers and nuances to a very interesting character. A whole movie could have been made about this stage of Loki's life and it would have been so much more entertaining and compelling than this load of work. Hiddleston portrays Loki as unchained with no loyalty to anyone. This is the first film where we see him as a trickster and Hiddleston delivers suffice to say. The problem is he isn't really in the film long enough. Jane Foster, Darcy, and Dr Selvig all get more screen time than Loki. Here's my brilliant business proposition to Marvel. Don't make any movies but Avengers films. Give your golden boy Joss Whedon the four hundred or so million you spent on 'Iron Man 3' and 'Thor the Dark World' and see what he does with it. In watching 'Iron Man 3' and this film it is clear that is where the mindset and passion are. I hope the Marvel cinematic universe can be saved but I have to say that their track record is looking really bad right now. Kevin Feige and Disney should look back at Favareu's first 'Iron Man' film. It was gutsy and took risks and there was no guarantee of immediate endless sequels."", 'The plot barely exists for this film. Generic evil people try to take over universe, Thor stops them, the end. Which might have been alright but there was very little action in this mindless action film. What little fighting we got was poorly orchestrated and repetitive.The dialogue is wooden and adds nothing. The characters with the exception of Loki have no depth and only exist as an assortment of clichés. Hiddleston makes for a great Loki but that is literally the only good or interesting thing in the entire film.Thor continues to be the worst Marvel movie franchise and Hemsworth is possibly the worst actor to ever star in multiple major movies.', 'Go ahead and find this review not useful. But listen to me. I love Marvel films. The Original Spider-man Trilogy was amazing and The Avengers was awesome. But when I saw Iron Man 3 I was bored out of my mind and I felt it was not good. So I lowered my expectations for this movie and hoped it would be better right? Because from what I learned, the lower the expectations, the better the movie. Big Mistake.Thor The Dark World is all over the map with scenes of badly choreographed action scenes to bad comedy to laughable acting.I really wanted to like this film because I liked the original Thor. It was really good and it was directed by Kenneth B. who is the man who made The best adaptation of Hamlet Ever. But the movie suffers from production troubles to a bad script.The Film begins with this super magic thing called the Ether... I think which causes destruction. They find it and this one guy says ""Lets Destroy it."" but this other guy says ""ITS TOO POWERFUL! We must put it in a place where it is easily touchable!"" I knew this was going to be a bad film because the beginning suffers from cliché after cliché.Thor returns to Earth because Jane gets the Ether in her and they must heal her. The Dark Elves who are the bad guys for the film attack Thor\'s planet and the main baddie tries to line up the main 9 planets and cause darkness everywhere. Thor gets Loki from Prison and they go stop the evil baddie.The script and direction are extremely weak. The script sucks because the dialogue is horrendous. The acting is hilarious from Anthony Hopkins as Odin as he overacts a lot in this movie.The action scenes are poorly choreographed and make no sense.Also, Heroes should have weaknesses. Thor nearly throughout the whole Has none. Why should we care if they are unstoppable without any weaknesses, that takes away the credibility of the character.Also, this teleporting plot line makes no sense. They go nearly everywhere in this movie. In the final fight scene fall everywhere going back from place to place. They never explain why these teleports are randomly put all over the map but it really annoys me.The jokes... oh my god. They are so unfunny. Who cares if the Professor guy\'s pants are not on? Bad comedy has to be understood and this movie doesn\'t understand comedy. The character of Darcy is obnoxious. She was alright in the first but she always has to say HOLY SH*T 500 times a scene.The special effects are alright but its not always about the effects. One effect actually hurt my eyes and I didn\'t know if it was the 3D or if my eyes just hurt.There are very few good things about this movie. The guy who plays Loki is one of the only redeeming qualities of this movie and he is very convincing. The Stan Lee Cameo is also great and funny like always. There is a awesome twist I wont spoil. But that\'s about it.This movie is just super loud in its bad action scenes are poor acting and ear bleeding sound effects.Thor The Dark World is the worst movie of the year without a doubt. I was disappointed severely. Marvel can be much better then this and I hope Captain America The Winter Soldier does a better job at being a better superhero movie.25/100 D', 'Thor: The Dark World left me wondering why for all its popularity and box office hype the superhero genre so regularly fails to ignite the faintest trace of excitement and imagination in its narrative and storytelling. This sequel, following Kenneth Branagh\'s reasonably funny 2011 film, was written by no less than five writers, who between them have only mustered another dull, achingly generic story about saving the world. Aside from less than a handful of funny self-referencing points, this is a hugely disappointing by the numbers blockbuster that under services its embarrassingly rich cast and offers its enormous fanbase too little that is challenging, inspired or even surprising. What\'s confusing about the deliberate complacency in the script is that it\'s entirely unnecessary. There is no financial risk to comic book adaptations anymore to justify this kind of dumbing down. Earlier this year, Iron Man 3 became one of the top five highest grossing films of all time. While Christopher Nolan\'s Batman films have achieved financial success without succumbing to simplified narrative lines. Some even complained The Dark Knight Rises had too many story threads. How many filmmakers today would crawl over broken glass for a cast featuring Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman, Anthony Hopkins, Idris Elba, Tom Hiddleston, Chris O\'Dowd and Stellan Skarsgard? With such talent it\'s not unreasonable then to ask for more than obligatory special effects and indistinguishable villains, who are included only to prop up pseudo- scientific plot points. Little effort has been exhausted into humanising these characters. Thor (Hemsworth) is a blank slate who swings his hammer and growls at people. It makes Chris Hemsworth look like a boring actor when we\'ve seen how charismatic he can be, like he was in Rush, with the right material and director. There are fewer fish out of water jokes that I enjoyed in the first film. Natalie Portman, normally a delightful, charming actress, is embarrassed here as Thor\'s girlfriend, playing a character devoid of plausible emotional responses and desires. Her first reaction after being warped from London to Asgard is to say ""Hi!"" and ""Let\'s do that again!"" Never mind that her skin is now infected with the Aether, a weapon of mass destruction from an ancient group called the Dark Elves (who speak perfect English no less). She\'s more impressed that Thor told his dad about her! The Dark Elves are led by Malekith (Christopher Eccleston), who wants to use the Aether to destroy the world. Comic book films rise and fall on the quality of their villains. The Dark World has two, both of whom are substandard. The Dark Elves, branding swords and laser weapons, aren\'t very interesting. Though Thor\'s brother Loki (Hiddleston) sometimes brings comic relief to the film\'s dry, seriousness (I did enjoy one clever shape shifting moment) he still doesn\'t possess the physicality of Tom Hardy\'s Bane to be a truly menacing physical threat. Locked up in a cell for nearly half the film, there\'s not a lot for Loki to do. What should also be a haunting surprise at the end of the film is badly telegraphed. When Thor and Loki inevitably team up, the brothers take a few more punches than you might expect, but still recover very quickly, even after a severed hand. Marvel is a subsidiary company belonging to Disney so this is largely bloodless action. This is the first comic book feature film by Alan Taylor, who replaced Patty Jenkins under controversial circumstances. Taylor has worked on television shows like Game of Thrones, and he brings little distinction to the action and the way the story is told. The camera isn\'t particularly mobile and significant plot lines like the Aether are lazily signposted through the film\'s prologue. He opts to intercut Thor\'s main story with a subplot involving Jane\'s scientist friends back on Earth, including an overly excitable Kat Dennings, who are discovering the alignments of Asgard\'s nine realms, if that matters. Sometimes they lighten the mood but they\'re still cornball stereotypes (the wacky sidekick, the crazy scientist and the dorky intern) that don\'t instill any visible subtext to the plot. The two narrative threads collide with Taylor\'s most elaborate set piece, as Thor fights simultaneously between universes, a battle that is undone by Thor\'s own indestructibility. Over the closing credits are shots of the film\'s concept art, which could be totally interchangeable with most of the plotting. It\'s time that comic book fans started to demand more from these films before the entire genre evaporates into a disposable, commercialised heap like it does here.', 'Let me start off by saying I had fairly high expectations for this film, not only being a fan of the first film but of Thor as a comic book characters. To be nice, these expectations were not met. To be realistic, this is easily the worst of the Marvel movies. This is my first review so sorry if I jump around a lot with what I say. Let\'s begin with the characters. Thor was.. okay. He said nor did anything noteworthy really. He didn\'t grow that much as a character, and simply felt boring. Natalie Portman was horribly boring to watch, and in some scenes her character was written as an idiot. That seems to be a common problem with the movie. Jane Foster? An idiot. Eric Selvig, an originally intelligent character that had some serious, good talks with Thor? Running around naked because the Tesseract made him go insane... or something. It wasn\'t very clear. Speaking of, if he went insane because of the Tesseract, why was Hawkeye completely okay after a bonk on the head? Darcy? The most annoying girl on the planet. She was meant for comedy but came of as GRATING to listen to and watch. Odin was a douche who didn\'t know how to rule properly. Malekith was just... boring. The makers had so much to work with, considering in the comics what a clever sorcerer he is, as well as a deranged homicidal madman. In this movie his motivations are unclear and his only character trait was he likes to frown at things with his puffy looking face. Character wise the only saving graces were Idris Elba as Heimdall and Tom Hiddleston as Loki, which did not matter much considering how little they were in the movie. Which is strange because Loki is in the trailer so much, but has MAYBE 20 minutes of screen time. The special effects in this movie were just ugly. Every monster looked fake and many of the scenes looked like they were pulled out of a last gen video game. the set design was okay, but not once did I feel immersed. Everything felt like a flimsy set. It was just an ugly movie to look at. The plot was just all over the place, with cuts to different scenes happening frequently. Many scenes were completely useless could have been cut altogether. Literally the only good scene was when Loki and Thor trick Malekith. Also, considering it was never explained how Loki was able to survive a stab wound, switch places with a guard, then switch places with Odin becoming the new leader of Asgard, the ending makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. The dialogue was just... horrendous. There were multiple points where myself and the people I\'ve seen the movie with just laughed at the ridiculousness of what was being said. Speaking of, the movie was farrrrrr too funny. Don\'t get me wrong, I like comedic relief in these Marvel movies, it works for the established universe but GOD they literally play every scene for comedy it seems. Even the final world ending battle with Malekith was played for comedy. For Christ\'s sake, THOR RODE TO THE BATTLE IN A SUBWAY CAR. There\'s a gag where him and Malekith are sliding on the side of a building with office people looking outside blankly, completely meant for comedy.. IN THE FINAL, WORLD ENDING BATTLE. Avengers, Thor, Iron Man 1,2 Captain America, all these movies had the common sense to put the comedy in scenes where it was necessary. Hell, even Iron Man 3, the most comedic movie behind this one had the common sense to say ""This is the final battle. Let\'s make this badass"". Another problem with the final battle itself is that it has no \'WOW\' moments. There\'s no real climax, everything is just bleh. OH and Malekith is squished by his spaceship. That\'s something. Oh and why the hell do Asgardians and Dark Elves have so many technological based things?! They have star ships, turrets, laser cannons, ray guns, etc. There\'s nothing here that feels like magic, which is what Thor should be about. And the Aether. The main point of the movie. The weapon to spread darkness throughout the universe essentially ushering an era of rule under Malekith. I couldn\'t tell you a damn thing about this thing other that it spread... darkness. whatever that means. The concepts that this movie is trying to give are incredibly under explained. Where did the Aether come from? Not explained. How did Jane end up actually finding it? Not sure. What\'s the Convergence? It\'s when the 9 realms line up so Malekith can... spread... darkness?.. How powerful is it? I have no idea. Apparently universe shattering, but Thor doesn\'t have much trouble fighting an Aether powered Malekith. It\'s actually kind of sad how easily he was dispatched. There is little fun to be had in this movie. It\'s just stupid. I didn\'t care about a single character besides Loki, who was actually somewhat developed and easily stole the show when he was on screen. This movie is absolute garbage and has ruined Thor cinematically for me. I truly hope Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Guardians of the Galaxy are good or I truly worry for the Avenegers 2. Please save your money. Don\'t see this movie. Don\'t tell the studios that this Transformers 2 level garbage is okay to put out, that these characters are okay to ruin. In the end, I give this movie a 2 out of 10, because Idris Elba was good, Loki was fantastic, and it had a single scene in the movie where it gave me a glimmer of hope that it would be redeemed. I\'m sure I have far more to address but I\'m trying really hard to forget this film and reread the latest Thor comic epic, Gorr the God Butcher. If you want to see some good Thor, read that rather than watching this. Please.', 'I am not sure where to begin....Maybe I was a bit lost because I never saw the first ""Thor""...and I am not familiar with the character and what he is all about...But regardless...this movie was rambling and disjointed. All the characters were so superficial and one dimensional that I did not care in the least what happened to any of them. Apparently the entire universe was at risk, and this film managed to make that prospect completely boring and leave the viewer 100% indifferent about the outcome. Impressive.There were a few attempts at humor thrown into the movie. They were all childish...they failed...and in fact were so ""unfunny"" they made me cringe.About Thor. How interesting is a character who is apparently entirely omnipotent....? Near as I can tell, he can neither be hurt nor killed....and can travel the universe at more than the speed of light. Yawn. I have enjoyed Natalie Portman in many films...but even she could not contribute anything useful to this turd.Having said all this...as of this writing this movie has a 7.6 IMDb rating. I don\'t get it... I felt I had to post an honest review to counter that nonsense.', ""Following on from the events of the Avengers movie, Thor is back in Asgard, delivering Loki, who is damned to spend an eternity in the Asgardian dungeons.Jane is in London, still pining for the titular character, as she hasn't seen him for two years, but still holding out for him.But there is a new threat from the dark elves. They seek an elixir type essence that will cause darkness amongst the nine realms.Jane however has found a portal into one of the realms, and gets infected by the essence. Because the dark elves can trace this source, Thor rescues her and takes her back to Asgard, much to Odins dismay.But the elves plan an attack on Asgard, and after many lives are lost, Thor realises that only one person can help him, and he's damned for the rest of his life....The first movie was wonderful. Not only was it exciting and refreshing, but it was one of the funniest Marvel movies released yet. This however takes a huge step back, and really taints phase two of the Marvel releases.Hemsworth is as good as ever, as is Hiddleston, but apart from Portman, it appears that the rest of the cast have been sidelined, so Thor and Loki can carry on their war of nerves.It's also very convoluted, narrative is lost as there is so much going on, and by the end of it all, you wondered what on earth went on, an also what happened to a few of the characters, there are plot holes aplenty.The humour what was wonderful in the first movie, feels really forced in this, and instead of causing unexpected laughter, had me rolling my eyes as to how silly it felt. Dennings is a thorn in the movies side, she is a parody of her character from the first, and ruins every scene she is in.The best joke in the film, which was in the trailer, steals from Raiders of the Lost Ark anyway.Visuals are bland and boring, and Asgard feels like something from The Phantom Menace, combined with Flash Gordon, and the rest of the realms could have come from any Lord Of The Rings movie.Its a shame, because Marvel know they have a winning formula, but here it feels like they are just in it for the money, and all the cool references and a brilliant cameo, cannot save such a disappointment.Many will call it Thor-some and other play on word praises.But for me, and I really hate saying this because Hemsworth is really good, it's pretty Thor-ful."", ""I guess it may be the fact that I never actually got into comic books (beyond Asterix and Tintin that is) that this movie didn't really appeal to me. I guess in another way that I did not find that mixing the gods of the Norse pantheon with the world of superheroes really worked all that well. To me it just seemed to be wrong. Okay, I understand that Thor is the member of the Avengers, and the comic series that bears his name is quite popular, but to me parts of this film did not seem to work. In fact I found it quite boring.Okay, I did manage to spot Stan Lee, and I did like a couple of the twists at the end, but I am also glad that I missed the end-end sequence (as opposed to the end sequence) but then I have never been one who really wants to sit through a bunch of credits just to see the end scene. Some people suggest that we should sit through all the credits to acknowledge the contribution that the people made to the movie, however that may be, and they are entitled to that view, but my understanding is that if your name is in the credits it means a lot more than just me seeing it. I my name was in the credits to a movie I would rather potential employers see it because that is evidence that I have experience working on a film set.Also, the other thing that gripped me with this film was the numerous references to 'The Avengers'. Now, I have seen The Avengers, but it was over a year ago and I simply cannot remember much of what happened in that film. The references in Ironman 3 were okay because that assumed that you had seen the film but may not have remembered many of the details (I remember a giant centipede flying around New York City and Robert Downey Jnr) whereas this film seemed to assume a working knowledge and deep familiarity with The Avengers, something which simply did not work for me."", 'I know this film has been ragged on by many people, but I really enjoyed it. Was great seeing Asgard, and how Mjolnir followed Thor around was wonderful. Hey, Thos has always been one of my favorite characters, and Hemsworth plays him so well.', 'Well they got the ""dark"" part right. Does it distress anyone at all that somewhere deep in the bowels of Hollywood there are people who make many times what you make for coming up with the idea that watching a lot of banging and clanging in an alternate universe that -- at its best -- resembles Central Park at midnight is .... entertainment? If it does not, it should. The problem with sequels like this -- aside from the fact that they are actually produced in the first place -- is that they serve no useful purpose other than making the original in the franchise look better than it was. I promise you, IN THE NAME OF ODIN AND ALL THE 9 WORLDS, that half way through this exercise in controlled depression, you will long for Thor 1. (With its really clever opening -- essentially the story of a Boy and his Hammer, having been separated therefrom, and finally reunited). Tom Hiddleston steals all his scenes, in some places he is more interesting huddled in a corner reading a book than all the CGI flashbangs and associated pyrotechnics combined. Sir Anthony -- a man seemingly untroubled by how poorly this phase of his career pales in comparison to his prior work -- is lost behind his eyepatch and almost unrecognizable. Portman has never had better H&M (hair and makeup) and in the chatgroups there are fanboys prattling on about watching this with the sound off. A final factoid: In the 60s, in the days when Marvel was only comics, Thor was never top gun, it was the artwork (flaming yellow hair) and the pleasant predictability of the stories and the arcane language that carried the brand. So far, Marvel has yet to really translate this into film.', ""Occasionally in life there are those moments of unutterable fulfillment which cannot be completely explained by those symbols called words. This sequel is one such moment. I do need to see it again. In terms of pure enjoy-ability, I put it top 3 of all sequels that I have enjoyed.What I really liked...-Every single character gets a moment to shine and every single actor cast in these parts are perfect. -The comedy is perfect. It's such a fine balance overall and everything works because it's very subtle and fits in with certain circumstances. -Some very tender emotional scenes. I won't spoil anything with specifics. -Some superb action and what could very well be award winning special effects. -All characters interactions are great and handled very well. This is a fantasy story that really cares about character first and it shows all the way through. Even Natalie Portman's Jane feel more fleshed out than she did in the original film. -The set pieces and other realms talked about in the first are seen here and are beautiful and well done. Asgard was even better believe it or not. -The mid-credit and end credit scenes, both cool. Make sure you stay for both.Marvel hit a pure home run with this endeavor. This film works because of the great cast and the fact that they took this subject matter seriously but remember to have fun. Chris Hemsworth was again perfect. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie."", 'The first Thor was probably one of Marvel\'s more trickier movies since it centered heavily around Norse mythology. To make it work in the ""real"" world was a massive task. Integrating a billionaire playboy who doubles as a tech-powered superhero, or a scientist who turns into a green rage monster was easier to accomplish than the fantastic world of Asgard, Gods & Monsters.Credit must go to Kenneth Brannagh who found the right balance between the fantastic and ""real"" (that\'s a stretch anyways) world. Furthermore, Brannagh focused on the characters instead of bombastic vfx (he still provided tons of beautiful shot visuals though).His replacement Alan Taylor however goes in the opposite direction and favors stylish visuals over character development. Worse still, the pacing and tone are all over the place.The Dark World tries to hard to provide the same brand of humor Joss Whedon is known for but fails to deliver the laughs, or they are rather misplaced.Bottom line: It\'s a too unfocused movie that suffers from a weak script and a director who tries too many things at the same time.', ""Having just watched a premier screening, I am delighted to come away from the cinema to write a positive review. Thor Dark World is a spectacular special effect driven film, much of which is set in Asguard.I was worried that including Loki yet again might become a little repetitive, but in this film he excels as a great character, I only hope however that they don't overdue his presence in the Marvel Universe. How many times can this guy come back from the dead?There isn't as much character development as the first film, and Thor's friends are nowhere near as interesting as the Avengers. I guess they simply needed these characters to all remain as they were so as to keep continuity within the Marvel universe, but its noticeable how little impact the storyline will have on anybody.The armies of Asguard were noticeably lacking in fire-power and weapons (even though they have an armoury), which is made even more evident when an entire guard division bring knives to a laser-gun fight. Their turrents were the only defense they had against an Ariel assault and proved to be practically useless. You would expect them to be better prepared.The healing powers of Thor, Jane, and even a smashed alien space-craft become a bit of a running joke as well. But at least they get hurt, even if it only takes them a scene to heal. And if smashing every column holding up a building is still not enough to take it down I'm not sure what will be. Christopher Eccleston played a competent bad guy, although his intentions for what he was doing was still unclear as to why. Its simple to say he was insane and just wanted to kill everybody, but when a threat of that magnitude appears and planetary alignments are in effect, you expect half the Universe to show up and stop him or take advantage of the situation, or come looking to take the power for themselves. I also expected to see the entire army of Asguard come to help out at the end like they apparently did in the past. Not just Thor who appears there by mistake.The scientist with the miraculous plot saving devise is also a little hard fetch to take in, especially when he creates a remote control for cosmic anomalies. Along with Loki's illusion power which also serves as a convenient plot-saving devise at times. I'm willing to overlook these but there's no denying what they are. Overall its a good enjoyable superhero movie, which you will want to watch several times and is a decent entry into the Marvel Universe.P.S. Watch it in 2D, The 3D added little of worth."", 'Thor The Dark World is brilliant and completely tops the first film. There are a lot of extremely funny bits in it as well as some dark and moving moments. Probably a much funnier movie than it had any right to be given the subject matter. Loki is done perfectly and the dialogue between him and Thor is superb.If you\'re a fan of the first, this certainly won\'t disappoint at all. Without spoiling anything, the scale of this film is very Avengers-like in that the action pieces are amazing. During a sequence halfway through, I literally turned to my friend and said, ""this is freakin\' awesome"".Needless to say, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Each frame is packed with action, heartfelt emotion, humor, drama or intensity. I was expecting to simply see crazy mythology with monsters destroying the landscape of the nine realms for two hours. Instead, I was shocked at the depth and complexity of this film. You definitely need your brain and your heart turned on for this one, unlike other CGI mishmashes. If you want a movie with just dumb action and no plot then stay away from this exceptional film. The performances are top tier and the visual effects may be the best I\'ve seen this year. I have to join the majority of people and even critics that are praising this film. It\'s a true joy and such a pleasant experience.', 'Odin (Anthony Hopkins) recalls when his father Bor and the warriors from Asgard vanquished the evil Dark Elves and their leader Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) that wanted to send the universe into the darkness during the convergence of nine realms unleashing the powerful weapon Aether. Mallekith escapes and Bor hides the Aether in-between two stone columns.In the present days, on Earth, the scientist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) that is waiting for the return of Thor, investigates a gravity phenomenon in an abandoned factory with her assistant and her intern. She finds the column where the Aether is hidden and the substance possesses her. In Asgard, Heimdall (Idris Elba) reports to Thor (Chris Hemsworth) that Jane has disappeared. Thor returns to Earth and finds Jane; but when he sees that he has a strange energy protecting her, he brings Jane to Asgard to be healed. However, Malekith also awakes and goes to Asgard to retrieve the Aether. After a bloody battle, Frigga (Rene Russo) is murdered by Malekith and Thor proposes treason to his warriors friends of Asgard and teams up with Loki (Tom Hiddleston) to seek revenge for the murder of their mother and to vanquish Malekith before he destroys Asgard with his Dark Elves. ""Thor: The Dark World"" is another great adventure of Thor. In this movie, Thor makes the most unlike association with Loki and the result is a wonderful movie. The scene of Loki fighting with Thor is the best moment of ""Thor: The Dark World"". Chris Hemsworth perfectly impersonates Thor and the conclusion surprises. Last but not the least, the movie is to be watched until the very end of the credits because there are two additional scenes in the credits. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Thor: O Mundo Sombrio"" (""Thor: The Dark World"")', ""It's a good movie. Like that Natalie Portman was still in it. Too bad she wasn't in Thor Ragnarok. The bad was they tried to go funny at parts. It wasn't very funny."", ""Just got back from seeing this and thought I'd put in my thoughts.This is by far the most intricate and thoughtful of the Marvel films to date, with a great story and some superb performances, particularly Hiddleston's as Loki. The characters from previous Asgard related outings are there, but thanks to some good writing, are more 3 dimensional and therefore, interesting. This is one of the few films that would have benefited from an extra 15 minutes or so to explore further the motivations of the key protagonists. There is plenty of large scale action, as well as some laugh out loud humorous moments that help to keep this kicking along.I am both surprised and delighted that this is not only the best superhero movie to date, (even eclipsing Spider-Man 2), but currently the best movie I've seen this year.Don't miss this!"", ""For starters, I loved this film! I was a fan of the first but this one is superior in every way. The actions scenes are better, the plot is better and there is great banter throughout the film. Due to these factors it is entertaining and has more than enough in it to keep you interested. The acting is fantastic, especial by Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston, as they work great together and appear to have a great understanding of each others roles. I just can't understand why people don't like this film unless they are not a fan of superheroes. After seeing this film last night I read through a few of the reviews afterwards and was shocked as some people were giving it lower than 7. These people are clearly boring and have no idea about an entertaining film and enjoy watching films that just depress you and have no idea about what a fantastic superhero film this is. I recommend you watch this immediately as you won't be disappointed."", 'This film was just okay. Maybe my expectations were too high for Thor 2. I was really hoping it would improve on the first one (which was good but had so much more potential.) I saw some good reviews for this one and some bad ones, so I tried not to have my expectations up TOO high whenever I saw it on my own. Don\'t get me wrong--it was an enjoyable movie. It had its funny moments, many of them involving Tom Hiddleston. There was also more time spent on Asgard, and Jane finally got some more screen time. But overall, the film was average. Perhaps I was expecting more from it, but it fell down from my expectations (only slightly, as I did not love the first film but thought it was just decent). I really, really wanted to love it, but I didn\'t. So I guess I was disappointed in it.SPOILER ALERTThe plot of the story was mediocre. We\'re given a back story about the main antagonist, Malekith, and a little about Asgard and his connection to it, but it\'s a little incoherent. Which isn\'t totally bad, I guess, but Malekith\'s reasons for wanting to destroy Asgard just seem flat to me. He feels like your atypical I-Wanna-Destroy-Your-World type of villain, which has been done many times before.The way they make Jane get possessed by the evil source or whatever that Malekith needs felt like a forced way to have her in Asgard. She spends a lot of time passing out or cowering behind as battles wage on. It gets a little better near the end, where Jane helps Thor defeat Malekith, but overall she isn\'t given much to do. I don\'t expect her to be superman or whatever, given that she has no powers, but I wished she had been given more to do as opposed to being the victim of an evil entity. She also doesn\'t have enough chemistry with Thor to make me feel like they really love each other.Darcy was funny in the first film, and still was to an extent in this one, but there was times when she was annoying. She got too much screen time, and I believe that a comic relief needs less so that they remain funny and not get annoying. Her sidekick, or intern, also feels useless and is used to temporally replace Eric Selvig, who, thanks to Loki, has gone insane and does crazy antics for comic relief.As I mentioned earlier, Loki was fabulous in this film, having very funny one-lines and making smart remarks. However, his motives get a little messy in this film. It makes since that he would be a sort of shades of gray character, but when (and there\'s a HUGE spoiler coming up here) he is supposedly killed to sacrifice himself for Thor and then appears to be alive and wanting the throne is Asgard as Thor leaves to Earth, I\'m left confused. What was the point of Loki ""sacrificing"" himself if he wanted the throne? Was he pretending to die so that no one would suspect he\'d become king? Maybe that\'s just apart of the mystery of his plot, and I\'ll have to watch the next film to see. But, as a stand-alone, it\'s confusing.Odin is reduced to being a jerk for the sake of the plot. He shows little to no concern for Jane when Thor brings her to Asgard until he discovers what she is possessed with. He also basically tells Thor that the only difference between him and Malekith is that he ""will win"" the battle. This seems a little out of character from the Odin we met in the first film, who wanted to be a fair and strong ruler. I know why they did it-- to give Thor a reason to want to stay on Earth--but by making Odin do something that seems so rude kind of turns the audience off from his behavior.Once again, Thor\'s friends (Sif, Fandral, Volstagg, and Hogun) receive little screen time or anything character development in general. Fandral, Volstagg, and Hogun say little to no words in this film; a possible love triangle between Sif, Thor, and Jane is implied and then quickly gotten rid of. These characters are fun, and I really wish I got to see more of them.Some of the comic relief felt odd. For instance, Selvig is glad when Thor tells him that Loki dies but quickly offers Thor some very awkward condolences. I completely understand why he would want Loki dead--this IS the man that possessed/made Selvig go crazy, after all-but the audience is led to believe that Loki really has died. Maybe they expected us to know that he hadn\'t? I know that I didn\'t believe his death, so maybe that\'s why. But there were other places where the comic relief felt odd, too, mostly exchanges taking place during the battle scenes. At least they were funny.And finally, the film feels entirely too short. I get that they might not want to make it longer for budget reasons, but if that\'s the case then they shouldn\'t try and throw in character development. Some things just felt rushed, and some characters feel underdeveloped. Admittedly the length is not as bad as it was in the first film, but this is mostly because we\'ve already gotten to know the characters and they are now being expanded on.SPOILER ENDSo that\'s pretty much how I feel about Thor: The Dark World. I guess it sounds like I disliked it more than I liked it, and maybe I do, but it wasn\'t a bad film. I\'d watch it again if someone asked me to, and I\'d laugh at the comical parts and still enjoy the movie. It\'s just one of those instances where a film is okay, or even good, but could have been better.', ""There are a number of reasons why I found this film to be disappointing, unlike its predecessor which I enjoyed very much.1) Underdeveloped Bad Guy Syndrome: I know almost nothing about the bad guy even after watching the film. A dark elf who wants to blow everything up. Apparently that's all we need to know and all we'll ever know about the main villain in the film.2) Pointless Main Characters: The main characters in this film offer nothing of substance or value. For example, you could have replaced Jane with any other character without affecting the film. She exists solely as plot vehicle. The film does not explore her relationship with Thor, her reaction as a character to being transported to a different world, etc., etc. She's as thin as cardboard, like the rest of the main characters of this film.3) Very Poor Humor: Almost all of the jokes in this film made me roll my eyes and groan. It's as if the script writers liked the humor in Avengers and attempted to duplicate it without any knowledge of how.4) Ridiculous Plot Devices: Things in this movie only happen because the script says they have to. For example, Jane being the one possessed by the dark energy. Or the car keys being discovered on another planet. These things make no sense but exist solely because they have to for the plot to continue. I hate that.I had high hopes for Thor II but in the end it was just another disappointing let down."", ""Infinitely better than the first (which I liked) because of better action, humor and emotion. All those people who were worried about Thor being underpowered are going to be pleased. The effects are wonderful and it is indeed a very funny and a very moving movie in places. I'm happy to report that neither factor is overused or gets in the way of the feel or story. It's the right amount of humor and right amount of angst. Cinematography is great and the score is amazing. Whoever scored this film should do so for the rest of the Marvel movies in my opinion.I knew they would nail the pathos but was pleasantly surprised by the creative fight sequences. They are phenomenal. Not overly long but when they rage, THEY RAGE. Also, Kurse can rival the Hulk in terms of scary power. He was better utilized than the Destroyer was in the first film. Loki is the scene stealer that was all hoped to see! Jane and Sif add more than eye candy but you would expect no less from Marvel. Hemsworth has cemented his legend as Thor with this effort. My only real disappointed is a minor one. They didn't really show the nine realms in any real detail. It seemed a cop out that hey're just open landscapes. Yet, maybe they didn't want to commit to anything for future movies.Overall, this is a wonderful movie and maybe Marvel's best solo film."", ""Thor the Dark World was the first Marvel movie I've seen and the first at the movies and I really liked it. Sure the main villain was not great but that didn't destroy the movie. I still like the movie to this day and like it more and more each time a watch it everyone has their own opinions and this is mine."", 'Personally I am more of a DC fan than Marvel, but it seems like everyone has been pressuring me to watch the second installment of the Thor movies, and...it was disappointing.Thor 2 is directed by ""game of thrones"" director Alan Taylor who proved that he has a future in Hollywood, Alan Taylor is a great director, Thor 2 looked beautiful and the fight scenes were great. Sadly Alan Taylor\'s great directing could not overcome Thor 2\'s disappointing story, in my opinion it is too early to make a Thor film that takes place in Asgard, but it made sense because it seems that the Thor franchise can not survive without Loki. The film felt very messy as we learn about Malakith, a villain who barely appears in the film, the viewers just have no connections what so ever with the MAIN VILLAIN of the movie. Instead the writers focused on Loki who was amazing in this film, but the countless ""is this guy Loki?"" confusion was way too much, the viewer was unable to relate, first it was Loki against Thor (in the cell), then it was Loki with Thor (while going to the secret passage) then it was Loki against Thor, but we find out it was a trick...then Loki ""dies"" BUT we later find out he betrayed Thor...that was Way too much ""Lokiception"". In the film we see a slight tension between Sif and Jane Foster which I found to be completely unnecessary because except for the awkward looks they give each other, nothing really happens between them. The humor in Thor 2 is outstanding, but it gets repetitive at times. It felt like some points in this film were just not necessary at all! I understand that the writers wanted to make a point but the scenes were very briefly explained (the date in the beginning of the film). Although Chris Hemsworth did a good job as Thor, but it\'s starting to get old, I don\'t get the feeling i get when watching Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man or Hugh Jackman as the wolverine. But Tom Hiddleston is brilliant as ever. Overall, Thor: The dark world is an overrated film, where we see messy writing, mediocre acting (except for Tom Hiddleston) and unnecessary tension between the characters. Although Thor 2 had some flaws it is still worth watching Alan Taylor\'s outstanding directing in the film.', 'Eons ago, Bor, the father of Odin, clashes with the Dark Elf Malekith, who seeks to destroy the universe using a weapon known as the Aether. After conquering Malekith\'s forces, including enhanced warriors called the Kursed, on their home world of Svartalfheim, Bor safeguards the Aether within a stone column. Unbeknownst to him, Malekith, his lieutenant Algrim, and a handful of Dark Elves escape into suspended animation.In present-day Asgard, Loki stands imprisoned for his war crimes on Earth. Meanwhile, Thor, alongside warriors Fandral, Volstagg and Sif repel marauders on Vanaheim, home of their comrade Hogun; it is the final battle in a war to pacify the Nine Realms following the reconstruction of Bifröst, the ""Rainbow Bridge"" between realms, which had been destroyed two years earlier. In London, astrophysicist Dr. Jane Foster\'s intern, Darcy Lewis, now with her own intern, Ian, takes Jane to an abandoned factory where objects have begun to disobey the laws of physics and disappear into thin air. Separating from the group, Jane is teleported to another world, where she is infected by the Aether.The Asgardians learn that the Convergence, a rare alignment of the Nine Realms, is imminent; as the event approaches, portals linking the worlds appear at random. Heimdall alerts Thor of Jane\'s recent disappearance, leading Thor to search for her. When she inadvertently releases an unearthly force while being arrested by the police for trespassing on private property, he takes her to Asgard. However, the Asgardian healers say they do not know how to treat her. Odin, recognizing the Aether, warns Jane\'s infection will kill her given enough time, and that the Aether\'s return heralds a catastrophic prophecy.Malekith, awakened by the Aether\'s release, turns Algrim into a Kursed and attacks Asgard. During the battle, Malekith and Algrim search for Jane, knowing she contains the Aether. When they fail to capture her, they escape, but not before killing Thor\'s mother Frigga in a swordfight. Despite Odin\'s orders not to leave Asgard, Thor reluctantly teams up with Loki, who knows of a secret portal to Malekith\'s world, where they will use Jane to lure and confront Malekith, away from Asgard. In return, Thor promises Loki that he can have his revenge on Malekith for killing their mother. With Volstagg and Sif stalling Asgardian soldiers and Fandral assisting their escape, Thor and Loki commandeer a Dark Elf spaceship and escape to Svartalfheim with Jane.On Svartalfheim, Loki tricks Malekith into drawing the Aether out of Jane. However, Thor\'s attempt to destroy the substance fails, and the Aether-empowered Malekith leaves with his ship as Loki appears to be fatally wounded while protecting Thor from Algrim. Thor, cradling Loki in his arms, promises to tell their father of his sacrifice. Following Loki\'s apparent death, Thor and Jane discover another portal in a nearby cave and reunite with Jane\'s mentor Dr. Erik Selvig, Darcy and Ian in London. There, they learn that Malekith plans to unleash the Aether to destroy the universe, and that he will do this in Greenwich, the center of the Convergence. Thor battles Malekith, but a portal separates them, leaving Malekith unopposed. Thor comes back in time to help his mortal comrades use their scientific equipment to transport Malekith to Svartalfheim, where he is killed before he can destroy the universe.Thor returns to Asgard, where he declines Odin\'s offer to take the throne and tells Odin of Loki\'s sacrifice. As he leaves, Odin\'s form transforms to that of a grinning Loki.In a mid-credits scene, Volstagg and Sif visit the Collector and entrust the Aether to his care, commenting that, with the Tesseract already in Asgard, having two Infinity Stones so close together would be dangerous. As they leave, the Collector remarks, ""One down, five to go."" (Foreshadowing the Guardians of the Galaxy movie.) In a post-credits scene, Jane and Thor reunite on Earth, while somewhere in London a frost monster from Jotunheim, accidentally transported to Earth during the final battle, continues to run amok.']"
35,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Captain America: The Winter Soldier,1843866,"[""That is not to knock the first Captain America film because I enjoyed that too, just that Captain America: The Winter Soldier personally came off as superior. Some of the second half does try to cram in too much giving off an at times bloated and convoluted quality, other than that Captain America: The Winter Soldier was excellent. It is a great-looking film with stylish cinematography and editing that give off a gritty and audacious look, and the special effects and the stunts are of the quality that you can't take your eyes off them. The music is not quite as good as it was in the first but it has enough of the rousing excitement and haunting intensity to make it a good score that matches what is going on on screen. The action sequences are spectacularly choreographed and of edge-of-your-seat calibre whether it is a highway car chase or a sky battle with some of the destruction authentically harrowing, and the screenplay is one that is smart and snappy with heart aplenty. The story is mostly compelling and very cleverly constructed, it mixes action, comic-book adventure and political thriller and does it in a way that is well-balanced, that is alive with nimble nuances and in a way that the film gives off a sense that it knows what it's trying to be. It's suspenseful and exciting with its fair share of themes that gives the film emotion and depth. The characters are engaging and interesting, with their personalities deeper and more expansive, and there is a much more believable villain this time around(the big reveal was actually quite surprising). A great thing considering that the cast of cast is quite large if not quite to the everything-but-the-kitchen-sink extent; the interplay between the characters works a treat also. Anthony and Joe Russo direct astutely and the acting is fine, with Chris Evans even more confident than he was in the first, Scarlett Johansson at her fearless and Anthony Mackie fitting comfortably in his role. Samuel L. Jackson is as dependable as ever, Robert Redford in a bold move gives seasoned support and is not stiff at all and Sebastian Stan is similarly authoritative. All in all, while there are a couple of issues with the second half Captain America: The Winter Soldier is an excellent sequel and manages to outdo the enjoyable first film. 9/10 Bethany Cox"", ""Chris Evans who seems to be making a career out of playing superheroes comes back as Steve Rogers AKA Captain America. He meets an old friend from the past in not the best of circumstances in Captain America: The Winter Soldier.The film begins simply enough as the Captain America team rescues some hijacked people on a ship at sea. But some other people on the team have some additional duties involving securing intelligence, a part of the mission that Evans is not told about. Things get dicey when his mentor and supervisor Samuel L. Jackson is shot and killed and Evans becomes a wanted man. But being Captain America, he's not such an easy guy to take down.In the end we're told it's a new world order being brought about by people who are thinking that people will beg for security with all the terror around them in this day and age. American establishmentarian figure Robert Redford goes against his all American hero type image to play the evil genius behind all this dirty work. Redford who probably came closest to a villain role before in Indecent Proposal looks like he's thoroughly enjoying himself as a bad guy.I have to say I've enjoyed Chris Evans as both Captain America and Johnny Storm the Human Torch. It's sad in this day and age that real heroes are to be found in comic books as source material for films. Back in Hollywood's golden age Evans would have been a great cowboy hero.Those who love Marvel comics will go for Captain America: The Winter Soldier in a big way. And some of us who never pick up comic books will enjoy it too."", ""THE WINTER SOLDIER is a far superior sequel to the original Captain America: unlike the first film, this doesn't descend into a CGI mess in the second half, and instead remains tight and compelling right up to and throughout the climax. This one has a retro, '70s political thriller-type feel going on, with Chris Evans cast as a friendless figure out of his time and out of his depth, at the mercy of sinister and unknown forces.It's a decent film too, one never less than entertaining, and the second-best Marvel film I've seen, right behind AVENGERS ASSEMBLE (which had the huge budget and scale as a result). The fast-paced narrative includes all manner of martial arts-based fight scenes which, although reliant on CGI, are still exciting to watch. The elevator sequence is a real highlight and expertly staged. The effects are generally above average and the humour and camaraderie that these films are known for are both present. Scarlett Johansson shines here and Samuel L. Jackson gets more depth than usual, while Robert Redford is fun in a stock role. I wouldn't call THE WINTER SOLDIER a masterpiece, but it certainly does the job well enough and never disappoints."", ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) *** (out of 4) Captain America (Chris Evans) is still trying to come to terms with who and what he is but now he must face someone he remembers from his past. It seems the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) is the strongest creation and it's up to members of SHIELD to try and stop him as well as a criminal (Robert Redford) wanting to cause mass destruction.CAPTAIN America: THE WINTER SOLDIER is a rare sequel that actually manages to be better than the original film. That's not to say the first film wasn't good but this one here pretty much adds a lot of steroids to the action and makes for an overall much better film. The cast is certainly in top form and directors Anthony and Joe Russo certainly know how to milk an action scene for everything that it's worth.There's no question that the highlights of the movie are the extended action scenes that features some terrific looking CGI that perfectly mixes in with the live action on the screen. It's really amazing to see how far technology has come over the past decade and this film certainly looks tremendous. The action scenes contain so much chaos and destruction that it's really a wonder that this stuff can be pulled off. There's one great action sequence after another and this here certainly makes the film.Evans is obviously quite comfortable in his role as Captain America and he's perfectly able to bring the human element that the story needs. The supporting cast is equally good with Samuel L. Jackson, Scarlett Johansson and Anthony Mackie all doing nice work. Stan is also extremely good in his role as the villain and when you've got someone like Robert Redford it just brings your film to another level.CAPTAIN America: THE WINTER SOLDIER is a fun, fast and over-the-top summer movie that actually delivers a good time."", ""Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) is still trying adjust to the modern world. He befriends fellow soldier Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) who later becomes Falcon. He goes on a mission to rescue hostages but Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) is more interested in securing intel. He is angry at Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) who is building an armada called Project Insight. Fury uncovers some secrets and is targeted by the mysterious Winter Soldier. He warns Captain America before being killed. Then Captain America is attacked by SHIELD after being questioned by Secretary Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford). Black Widow helps him investigate.This is a good movie whether it's a Marvel movie or a comic book movie. It's got some political espionage thrills. It takes the Marvel universe into darker territories. It advances the plot to an interesting place. The characters get room to move and grow. The action is great and doesn't overwhelm. It's more human-sized. It's a smart action thriller."", 'I read comic books years ago but not for a long time. I have watched many of the Marvel films already released but don\'t have that foundation that the fan-boys have. My mistake was not realizing there was a previous movie when I went to this one. So it took a little information from my twenty something son to get me up to speed. I\'m sure most of you reading this know the Captain America mythos. This is a high speed, action every minute, mind bending experience. The individual characters are interesting and complex. I still need to watch the first movie to actually figure out the whole ""Shield"" and ""Hydra"" thing and how it works and what Captain America has done. However, when you have your characters being pursued by the most formidable of villains, it isn\'t necessary to have an encyclopedic knowledge of all this stuff. For an old fogie, I thoroughly enjoyed this film and look forward to going back and watching the first one', 'A correct film. It is the basic virtue. And the source for profound admiration and respect for the entire team behind the film. First - for a profound story who reflects contemporary fears. Second - for cast and performances ( yes, the presence and the job of Robert Redford was the source of half of my appreciation). The fight scenes are real impressive. And the story seems not have significant flaws. Short, a seductive film. And admirable job.', ""Thor: The Dark World underwhelmed me. A run of the mill nonsense plot with some epic action and Loki getting some funny lines.Captain America: The Winter Soldier steps up to the plate and throws a curveball. In fact it takes a wrecking ball to the Agents of Shield. It strips it bare as a malevolent, infected bug that is not fit for purpose.Captain America has to go off the grid when Nick Fury tells him to trust no one. Shield agents are going rogue. Fury is left impotent and the ultimate question the movie asks. Is Robert Redford's character Alexander Pierce a turncoat?The Russo Brothers hark back to the 1970s conspiracy thrillers when filmmakers focused their attention in wrongdoing at the heart of government in an era of the Watergate scandal. Movies such as Three days of the Condor and All the President's Men, both starred Robert Redford.The Russos wanted to imitate this with a Marvel twist. With the revelations that various governments in recent years in the name of national security have monitored vast amounts of computer databases to track our internet or phone usage. This film has touched a nerve.We still get Marvel action heroics with big action set pieces. Captain America is more questioning but Chris Evans still cannot bring much life to what is a sturdy but dull comic book character.He still gets a better deal than The Winter Soldier who seems to be in deep freeze. Scarlett Johansson and Anthony Mackie provide able support and the veterans Redford and Jackson ask us to think about the here and now."", 'After commanding a successful rescuing mission of hostages from pirates in a ship, Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) meets Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) very upset since Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) had different objectives from his. Nick explains that he does not trust anybody but discloses the latest top secret project from SHIELD called ""Operation Insight"" that will launch three aircraft carries to the space linked by a satellite to protect the world. There is an attempt against Nick by the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) and Nick goes to Steve\'s apartment and delivers a flash memory to Steve. He tells that SHIELD is compromised with infiltrated HIDRA agents; then Nick is badly wounded by three shots and goes on surgery. Secretary Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford) asks Steve why Nick was in his apartment but he refuses to tell. Soon Steve is considered traitor and hunted down by the SHIELD agents and he teams up with Natasha and Sam ""Falcon ""Wilson (Anthony Mackie). Now they investigate the reason why Nick was chased and they discover a lethal secret plotted by the HIDRA. ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" is a highly entertaining adventure with non-stop action. The predictable story is not bad and the special effects are top-notch. Chris Evans seems to be a juicer but is a great Captain America; Scarlett Johansson is Scarlett Johansson and there is nothing else to say; Falcon has great lines with humor; Emily Van Camp is cut and the villains are great. I am looking forward to see evil The Twins against the hero Captain America. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Capitão América 2: O Soldado Invernal"" (""Captain America 2: The Winter Soldier"")', 'The superhero genre is getting more and more crowded with different franchises, crossovers and solo films all coming out in a strategic package, so there is a high risk of the audience getting turned off yet another big empty film with just noise and indestructible guys falling from great heights. In some cases this is the way, that the selling point are the noise and special effects, but Winter Soldier remembers that it is important to draw the viewer in because if they even sort of care about what is happening then the film will be better for it. It does this by having a plot that is made to appear smarter than it is by way of being topical (protection v freedom), and then building lots of events and plotting around it, and, when in doubt, finish every scene with either a dramatic pause or an action sequence.It is a formula that mostly works. Okay, it is a genre film at the end of the day and the money is all up on the screen with great effects work and technical design which produces some noisy and exciting action sequences, but it is the rapidly moving and building plot that helps keep the viewer engaged rather than just pushed back in the chair as an observer. There is still an element of this though, and there are aspects of the film that feel too busy with so many characters coming and going, and so little time to really take a minute without guns and shouting. The broad topicality of the plot helps this but in addition the writers have just about scattered enough character and banter through the script to help that side too.The cast are part of this and mostly they judge their performances right in that they have to appear to be more than caricatures, but at the same time nobody is looking for great character development here. Evans is likable in the lead, while Johansson, Jackson, Redford, Mackie, Grillo and others all know what they are doing and by the sheer force of presence, they help the film feel more robust than it is. Most importantly, even when the cast do essentially just become special effects, they do not feel like they are.Winter Soldier is a big entertaining film with plenty of action and event, however it is still a genre movie and has its limits. The plot is not as smart as it suggests but gets by on topicality, while at the same time we have almost too many characters and plotting kicking around – most notably the character of the sub-title is more about setting up another film and not delivering in this one. It still works though, with a good pace and action throughout, delivering good summer entertainment.', 'In this film Captain America (Chris Evans) is attempting to catch up. He is losing some of the dorkiness which made him lovable. He teams up with the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) because she tested well with male audiences in the 8 to 80 age bracket. Iron Man is mentioned, but it seems the rest of the Avengers are on vacation during the struggle for humanity.This film has a decent plot (i.e. fitting bad guys for good guys) with a good mix of action and drama. It even has some light moments such as when our twosome are among some old computers and Black Widow does her 1983 ""WarGames"" voice and proclaims, ""Shall we play a game?"" Of course Captain America can\'t catch the humor.Great popcorn film that explodes on the screen. I enjoyed this more than the recent Thor film.', 'Now I would like to take credit for that summary line ... come to think of it, no I wouldn\'t. But still the fact of the matter is, that my summary line is the actual title the movie received upon its release in Germany. Can you see them Dollar bills (or Euro bills in that case) in front of you? No you can\'t? There are there, because the only reason to change the title was to make it more marketable.Apart from that scheme though, this movie is better than the first one. Which I did like too (it\'s an origin story after all), but I understand that some weren\'t that fond of. It did have issues being in the past and all, but this one is in the ""now"" (well after the Avengers and the other movies). There is also a TV show (Agents of Shield) that might tie up into the events of this, which I haven\'t seen. Marvels plan with phases and different story lines does work very neatly.I reckon it won\'t be long until the first will get weary of all those superhero movies, but I\'m not one of them (yet). Especially because the quality is there. As with all the other movies, there are extra bits in the credits and after the credits. Nice ones too', 'I just read an interesting article on the film\'s directors, Anthony and Joe Russo. When they say it, you have to believe it - the picture is something of a commentary on present day, big government spying and terror-suspect \'kill lists\' that have become topical with the advent of wiretapping by the National Security Administration and drones equipped to target enemies of the state. One of the more chilling ideas presented by Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford) in the film was his objective to put seven billion people on the planet under his rule by wiping out a few million at a time until everyone gets their mind right. The movie presents society at a tipping point between freedom and chaos, and Cap had me when he declared his life against the threat of modern day tyranny.That\'s probably all just a bit too deep for a film based on a comic book super hero. But comics have never been shy about dealing with current topics, and neither have films. However if all that makes your head hurt, you can simply go into this as a slam bang action flick and it will still be entertaining. Captain America (Chris Evans) and his trusty shield deal out some nasty damage during the course of the story, and sometimes it\'s so fast paced you wish they\'d slow things down a bit so you can keep up with it all. With Cap, you have a 1940\'s hero who\'s still trying to adjust to his new life while holding on to the values that made America great.So while you\'re trying to keep up with the fast paced action, there\'s also a story line that can get a little tricky if you\'re not paying attention. The whole notion of not trusting anyone posited by Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) keeps Cap and the viewer on the look out for a double cross at every turn. He finds he can put his faith in a couple of resolute companions, the sexy Black Widow Natasha (Scarlett Johansson) and high flying Falcon Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie). Mackie actually gets some of the picture\'s best lines, like when he describes being a sidekick to the Captain - ""I do what he does, just slower"".And as always, my Marvel movie review wouldn\'t be complete if I didn\'t tip my hat to one of the guys that started it all back in the day, the inimitable Stan Lee, who cameos here as a security guard. When he discovers that someone (it was Cap) stole the museum\'s original Captain America uniform from a patriotic display, he declares his fate by stating - ""Oh man, I am so fired"".', 'As Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) struggles to embrace his role in the modern world, he teams up with another super soldier, the Black Widow, to battle a new threat from old history: an assassin known as the Winter Soldier.This was a very clever plot idea. Rather than the super villains of other heroes, have Captain America take on his own spy agency. This is the sort of thing one might expect in the Nick Fury comics, but Cap fills the role in nicely here. (Apparently Cap is replacing Fury, as now we see that he had the ""Howling Commandos"" in World War II, a group formerly lead by Fury in the traditional continuity).Apparently the Russo Brothers wanted to keep visual effects to a minimum, and this was a wise choice. Unfortunately, the effects kept in look really bad. How this got an Oscar nomination is unclear, because the scenes are just so animated-looking. Cap on the plane, attacking it with a shield? Could probably have been done without effects, and now looks silly.At least we finally got to see Samuel L. Jackson in an impressive car chase.', ""Avengers Assemble was such a big hit for the Marvel franchise, so I am making sure to follow the storyline that is continuing through each of the films, and of course I liked the first film starring the hero of this wearing the iconic costume, from directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo (Welcome to Collinwood; You, Me and Dupree). Basically it has been two years since the events in New York, Steve Rogers aka Captain America (Chris Evans) is still having to catch up with the modern world and pop culture, having been in suspended animation, frozen in ice for fifty years, he works for espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D. (Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement, and Logistics Division). He is sent on a rescue mission to save hostages on a vessel, alongside agent Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), in fact besides the rescue the mission involves extracting data from the ship's computers for S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), who explains about Project Insight, where three spy satellites can eliminate given targets, Fury is suspicious of the project. Heading to meet with agent Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders), Fury is ambushed by enemies, led by the mysterious masked assassin the Winter Soldier (Gone's Sebastian Stan), he survives the attack and makes it to Steve's apartment, Furty warns him that S.H.I.E.L.D. has been compromised and hands him a flash drive, before being shot and dying in surgery, Hill takes the body. Steve is summoned to the Triskelion, S.H.I.E.L.D.'s headquarters, to tell what he knows to official Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford), but refusing to say anything he is regarded a fugitive, but he escapes as the agency hunt for him, he and Romanoff join forces and in New Jersey locate a secret S.H.I.E.L.D. bunker where they can access the content of the flash drive. They activate a supercomputer with the preserved consciousness of Dr. Arnim Zola (Toby Jones), Zola explains that S.H.I.E.L.D. was founded after the Second World War, but since then enemy organisation HYDRA has secretly operated within its ranks, causing global chaos in the hope that humanity will surrender freedom for the security, and then the pair inside the bunker narrowly escape a missile attack on them. Steve and Romanoff recruit former USAF para-rescue man Sam Wilson aka Falcon (The Adjustment Bureau's Anthony Mackie) to join them, and they deduce the HYDRA mole inside S.H.I.E.L.D. is Jasper Sitwell (Maximiliano Hernández) who they catch and force to divulge the information he knows, that HYDRA has identified through data searching every single individual on the globe who is a threat to their plans, and the three satellites could be programmed to eliminate them all. Travelling to headquarters the trio are ambushed by the Winter Soldier and his assailants, during the long fight the assassin's masked is removed, Steve recognises him as his former comrade James Buchanan 'Bucky' Barnes, who he thought was dead, Hill then rescues the heroes and takes them to a safe house, where they find Fury is alive, he faked his death and he has plans to replace the programming chips for the satellites so they will not fire. At the Triskelion the World Security Council are gathered, Captain America exposes the plot by HYDRA, disguised Romanoff reveals herself and forces Pierce to leak out all classified information, Fury comes in eventually and after a struggle kills Pierce, meanwhile Rogers and Wilson work to try and change the controllers, but with the Falcon suit damaged Rogers is forced to do it alone, the Winter Soldier tries to stop him but the attack is stopped just in time for Hill to take control and have the vessels destroy each other. Wilson fights and defeats double agent Brock Rumlow (The Grey's Frank Grillo), while the Winter Soldier rescues Rogers when the vessels crash to the ground, but he disappears after this, in the end Fury using the cover of his apparent death heads to find the remaining HYDRA cells in Eastern Europe, Romanoff provides Rogers and Wilson information for them to track down the Winter Soldier program. Also starring Emily VanCamp as Kate aka Agent 13, Georges St- Pierre as Georges Batroc aka Batroc the Leaper, Jenny Agutter as Councilwoman Hawley, Garry Shandling as Senator Stern, Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter, Alan Dale as World Security Council Member, Callan Mulvey as Jack Rollins, Dominic Cooper as Howard Stark, Stan Lee as Smithsonian Security Guard, Gary Sinise as The Smithsonian Narrator, Silent House's Elizabeth Olsen (Mary-Kate and Ashley's sister) as Wanda Maximoff and Kick-Ass's Aaron Taylor- Johnson as Pietro Maximoff. Evans is still straightforward and definitely growing into the role as he becomes more determined, Johansson is terrific being equally determined and a little feisty, Jackson gets much more time on screen as the smart leader, and even though a little stiff Redford is a villain. You don't have to necessarily pay attention to all the dialogue, the story once you settle into it is well thought out, using the contemporary surveillance scandals to good effect for the usual world destruction concept, of course the best bits are the explosive chase sequences and special effects bundled fight and battle sequences which are fantastic, as a sequel it definitely outweighs the original, a most entertaining action adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects. Very good!"", '""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" was a step up from the 2011 movie ""Captain America: The First Avenger"".This is a great combination of action and special effects, and actually spiced up with a proper storyline that proved entertaining and also has the audience at a bit of guessing game as well. The plot line was very nice and well thought through, and it had several layers to it, which made for a more complex and enjoyable movie experience.The action sequences are great and they are filmed equally great. Lots of great fighting, adrenalin-filled action and testosterone.The acting throughout the movie was good as well. And it was actually surprisingly nice to see Robert Redford in a role such as the one he has in this movie.One thing I don\'t understand, though, is that you have a guy running around with a shield, why doesn\'t the goons and villains just shoot at his exposed legs? No, they have to shoot directly at an impenetrable shield of course. It just doesn\'t make any sense.Ah well, for a movie in the super hero genre, then the Captain America movies are actually some of the better and more enjoyable, as it is fairly devoid of super-human powers.""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" provides good entertainment and if you enjoyed the first movie, then you should most definitely watch this one as well.', ""Steve Rogers AKA Captain America (Chris Evans) is now a full-time agent for S.H.I.E.L.D., the high-tech law-enforcement agency led by eye-patch wearing champion of justice Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). After Fury is attacked by a mysterious metal-armed assassin known as The Winter Soldier. Accompanied by agent Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) and pal Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie), Rogers sets out to discover who is behind the violence and finds that evil organisation Hydra has been thriving within the very walls of S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters.Captain America: The Winter Soldier is regarded by many comic-book fans to be the best superhero movie to date. X-Men Days of Future Past currently holds that title in my opinion, but I do agree that there is much to enjoy about this second cinematic adventure for the super powered, shield-flinging patriot in the snazzy stars and stripes uniform. The story is solid and the cast superb (it's particularly nice to see old-timers Robert Redford and Jenny Agutter on board), the special effects are extremely impressive, and the film's stunt-packed set-pieces are spectacular, combining fast and furious fight action, incredible vehicular carnage, blistering ballistic mayhem, and death-defying acrobatics.Unfortunately, in their effort to provide as many jaw-dropping thrills as possible, directors Anthony and Joe Russo occasionally misjudge matters, allowing proceedings to go way over the top, thereby preventing the film from being the masterpiece that it otherwise could have been. Cap's plummet onto a concrete pavement and Sam Wilson's leap from the 40th floor of a building into a waiting helicopter might look impressive, but their sheer preposterousness serve to take the viewer out of the movie, if only for a moment: suspension of disbelief can only go so far.8/10. Not perfect, but for the most part, another very entertaining addition to the Marvel cinematic universe."", 'It was almost 3 years ago when I saw the initial Captain America movie with Chris Evans in the title role. I wrote ""This is my kind of movie."" And it is, a good story and appropriate action.I did not like this followup nearly as much. The story is OK but as seems to be the trend in modern action movies, too overloaded with visual effects, gunfire, and great explosions. It just so happened that this is the first movie I watched with my new powered subwoofer and the low bass in this movie gives it quite a workout. Even at moderate viewing volume I was able to measure SPL levels as high as 98 dB at my viewing position. That\'s a lot of bass!! Chris Evans is back as Steve Rogers, aka Captain America. So that the story can facilitate him looking just like he did at the end of the last movie, he has been frozen in a state of suspended life for most of the past 70 years. As a result he had no knowledge of historical events during the 1950s through the early 2000s.But the big current event was the treason by the agency that now is calling itself (in secret) Hydra. They have developed a very long list of individuals who they say need to be eliminated, and new machines are scheduled to be activated to get this done. Steve\'s job, along with a few loyal allies, is to stay alive as they hunt him down, and to stop Hydra. Other key roles are filled by Samuel L. Jackson as good guy Nick Fury. Scarlett Johansson as good guy Natasha Romanoff, aka the Black Widow. Plus Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson, aka the flying Falcon, and Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill. Also good to see good guy Emily VanCamp as Kate, aka Agent 13.The leader of the bad guys is Robert Redford as Alexander Pierce, along with Sebastian Stan as the Winter Soldier.The story is OK, to me the explosions and gunfire overdone to the point of becoming tedious while waiting for additional story elements. But it sure gets your subwoofer working!', 'So in short, this is what happens when you get Ed Brubaker to write the story (If not the script in full) to a Marvel movie, especially one he started on - you get the finest story and plot for a Marvel Avengers movie yet.You may notice I don\'t say best; I\'ll get to my nitpicks later. In this story, we get one of those pleasurable superhero comic book movies that is so enjoyable and engaging because it\'s ABOUT something, and in this case it\'s the Captain America movie for our times. Where the first film was a good old flag waving salute to world war two, and perhaps would be best seen in that context, Winter Soldier is for the America of Wikileaks and Edward Snowden, a time when secrets are being unveiled left and right and the NSA is probably everywhere and reading as I type out this review right now. And as a story I preferred only the first half of the first avenger more for its socio-political context before it became a two dimensional portrait of heroism - but here socio-political is the name of the game.What happens in the film is fairly complex to go into spoilers which... ah screw it, its Hydra. they\'re back, they\'re really the ""I was the one-armed man all along"" sort of thing, and the conflict, what really gets the story to be so impactful, is the large scope of trust. Who do you trust, who do you become paranoid of (especially when there is already suspicion, following what happened with New York), and what happens when the Good American super soldier has to be surrounded by complete uncertainty ? And more than that, what if a certain winter soldier who appears to be a super assassin (his equal in fighting prowess and cleverly is designed and costumed like the dark side version of Cap all in black with dirty black hair and guns), is someone else entirely as well. Stakes stakes stakes.That\'s all I hope to get in the substance of these movies, and I\'ve gotten it more often than not in these marvel studios movies (even last year in the somewhat maligned iron man 3 we got a wickedly funny look at media manipulation). On top of this is clever casting - Also spoiler, Robert Redford is not who he appears either, and its using him in such a role that makes the film enjoyable as well. Here is a guy who is an icon of 70s politic thrillers, ie days of the condor And the candidate and all the presidents men - and his image is upsided but just perfect for a movie ABOUT America in uncertain times.Its surprising for me too as I didn\'t think I cared too much about Sap after the first film, where he was the least interesting of the Avengers bunch; Steve Rogers seemed before to work best in the context of others, interacting with the other Avengers and the \'straight\' guy. here that contrast gets amplified in a very compelling way, even against a character like Natasha Romanoff, who knows where she stands and tries to stay human - let\'s make a joke about a kiss at least - amid the chaos.Another good thing as a side note, though it\'s a Captain America movie, it\'s also a Nick fury movie in some part and there it\'s also successful as you\'re never sure about this man in charge. What secrets does he hide, who is he protecting? needless to say as the audience you can\'t ever totally trust your own eyes. A question posed online recently was it this is the Best Marvel Movie Yet (in caps, pun intended). to answer this, if I still don\'t rank it completely on par with the two gold standard movies as far as just being great entertainments - the first Iron Man and the Avengers - it\'s some of the action from the Russo brothers that irked me.Not ALL of it, and they\'re not as egregious as some of the offenders of quick cut/closely shot films. but as a personal preference I just didn\'t care for some of the fights and action set pieces (again, not all of them, I would love to watch the nick fury car chase/shootout in the streets of DC as it is intense and decent to follow (and even to compare to the slightly similar chase in the dark knight). In some scenes and shots at times I just couldn\'t tell what was going on as say a winter soldier and other gunmen attack the heroes.But I can easily look past that enough to say this is a winner, a film that has something to say about the world we are currently living in, how times have really changed in 70 years and what happens when a man of total conviction as Steve Rogers is up against it (as well as some old revived villains). Its almost close to being a work, if one can see it as such, that could make people look twice and go \'maybe things should change when it comes to our government\'. Oh, and it\'s a fun goddamn kick ads spy movie thriller as well where the story points feel organic and there\'s even pathos near the end for characters we haven\'t seen too much time together with but enough for it to count.And Garry shandling as a senator!!', ""Marvel at the return of Captain America (Chris Evans) along with that of The Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson)! And dig his new co-hort in heroics, The Falcon (Anthony Mackie) at his side! Samuel L. Jackson is also back as Nick Fury and he's opposite Robert Redford for the first time in film history! Oh, and the reveal of the Winter Soldier will either surprise you or not, depending on your familiarity with those Marvel Comics. This was such a slam-bang awesome action pic that I loved seeing this in IMAX 3-D with my movie theatre-working friend as he did as well. Not a dull spot anywhere, that's for sure! So I highly recommend Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Oh, and as always, expect to see Marvel's Stan Lee somewhere in there as well..."", 'This film tells how Captain America saves the world from evil despite being almost 100 years old.I am thrilled to report that ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" is way better than the first ""Captain America"". This time round, there is a great plot that cuts to the chase right from the start. It spends no time fluffing around, and there is action and adventure all the way through. Many scenes left me astounded, such as the extended battle scene involving Fury and the police cars, and the scene involving disaster on the 41st floor. The special effects are very impressive, but the 3D is very underwhelming. Most of the time I don\'t even notice the 3D.Overall, I enjoyed ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" a lot. It is a great blockbuster!', 'Perfect pace and compelling script; with only one fault possible, maybe too much action. Anthony and Joe Russo direct this screenplay adaption of a Marvel comic by Jack Kirby and Joe Simon. Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) is brought out of suspended animation to find a much different world; one in which S.H.I.E.L.D has suffered many dark situations and Captain America himself is labeled a villain and much sought after person of interest. The plot may be spread a little thin, as someone from Steve Roger\'s past proves to be his major antagonist. The ""Winter Soldier"" (Sebastian Stan) will cause two of Captain America\'s friends from the past, Nick Fury (Samuel J. Jackson) and the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), come to the aid of the star-spangled super hero.An astute cast also features: Robert Redford, Cobie Smulders, Toby Jones, Anthony Mackie, Emily VanCamp, Maximilliano Hernandez and Stan Lee.', ""Stonking! Now this is more like it, after the disappointments that have been Iron Man 2 and Thor 2, Captain America gets a sequel of substance and sparks. It manages to blend everything required to make a great superhero film, lashings of derring-do heroics, action bonanza, adventure, some sexy sizzle and of course the key, a story with brains and mystery elements.True enough to say that the considerable contributions of Black Widow and Falcon (and Nick Fury of course) keeps this as a lively Avengers spin-off movie, which is no bad thing at all, but it's still the Captain who dominates things, marking himself out as a viable main man. In fact the whole film has the old school comic book feel, yes there's the grandiose pyrotechnics - unsurprisingly amped up for the big finale, but there's an adherence to serial thriller conventions that is, well, rather warm and comforting.With the Captain getting some surprising amount of emotional depth and humanity courtesy of the perfectly cast Chris Evans, the viewers have much to care about. Themes of Bondian world domination and global security crisis keep things nice and fanciful, while the unheralded work by the effects guys is modern cinematic art. There's some adherence to genre formula, and a bit of Marvel universe copy-catting going on, but this is one of the best films from the Marvel stable. A rich sequel indeed - more Captain America please. 9/10"", 'Hydra, a terrorist cell within S.H.I.E.L.D thanks to German scientists (like the malicious Zola whose ""brain"" exists within ancient databanks in an old warehouse), supposedly kills Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) and plans to use a Project Insight (with special aircraft machines equipped with superior weaponry) to annihilate anyone on earth who might threaten to deter their mission of herding humanity into captivity to follow a security rule. This would be to abandon freedom so anyone that might be a detriment to Hydra\'s plans is targeted for extermination. It will be up to Captain America (Chris Evans, who has made this character his own; this character will define his career for the most part) and former KGB officer, current S.H.I.E.L.D member (that was until Fury was attacked), Natasha Romanoff, the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson, with red hair and toned, athletic body) to stop Hydra. Joining them is former soldier, Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackle), going by Falcon because he has a special device in his backpack that unfolds metallic wings that allow him to fly. Assisting Hydra besides an equipped strike force called S.T.R.I.K.E is a former buddy of Captain\'s named Bucky (Sebastian Stan), captured by the Germans and built into a supersoldier called The Winter Soldier. With an arsenal of hi-tech weapons (including a computerized metallic arm akin to Captain\'s shield, explosives, and guns), impressive strength (he is one that can go man to man with Captain America), and fighting prowess (when Captain and the Winter Soldier do battle, neither can get an edge over the other), The Winter Soldier is quite a threat; he\'s the perfect solution to the pesky Captain America. Within S.H.I.E.L.D, Fury thought he had an ally in Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford; this role a direct departure for the actor), who is a high ranking member within the organization, but is wrong\x85.Pierce is Hydra and believes the solution is to coral the human race into rule. To him, The Winter Soldier is his weapon along with the Insight heliacarriers that will remove future threats to his and Hydra\'s dream rule.Convoluted plot or no, Captain America: Winter Soldier is an incredible action film and utilized the popular comic book super hero amazingly well. It brings him into this century and wisely incorporates the past and present to flesh out and evolve the character. It also takes a hard look at ""compromising"" one\'s ideals in order to survive in this day and age, with Captain America a throwback to old fashioned heroism, values, integrity, and defense of freedoms long fought and died for. Redford is a kind of example or symbol of corrupt idealism where the use of murder is necessary in order to adopt and secure a control over people, forgoing the moral entanglements that come with eradicating millions in order to achieve a master race of sheep. To stop war, diplomacy isn\'t the answer, it\'s removing millions so that the billions under Hydra rule could be part of a brand new future.Anyway, if you just want a comic book action film, this is perfect. You get incredible car chases (Fury\'s evasive van drive through the city in an attempt to avoid Hydra forces, Captain America and Natasha\'s first meeting with The Winter Soldier and members of S.T.R.I.K.E), breathtaking fight sequences (Captain\'s overcoming the strike force in an elevator and battle with The Winter Soldier on board a heliacarrier, and Captain\'s early fight with Georges St Pierre on board a ship where hostages of S.H.I.E.L.D are held), and eyepopping special effects (Captain\'s disarming a heliacarrier with his shield, Nick Fury\'s van withstanding major damage thanks to a protective shield, Captain\'s feats of strength through the use of his shield by going through windows and moving through the use of running like a locomotive) really provide the audience bang for their buck. A rather complex plot aside, this had something to say along with all the bells and whistles. Marvelous entertainment. The story of the Winter Soldier in relation to Captain\'s past is also well done. Anthony Mackle gets a plum supporting part while Redford successfully plays against type.', ""Captain America is a real throwback superhero. He embodies honesty and nobility. Truly, he's a superhero that all should look up to.He doesn't do it for me.Whereas the story of Winter Soldier was pretty good, Captain America (AKA The Human Torch from Fantastic Four) was exactly what I thought he would be. Stronger and faster than the most athletic man he can fight multiple foes; and with his shield he can even fight armed enemies. It's not that impressive. There have been so many Marvel and DC comic heroes to hit the big screen that a strong good fighting superhero no longer sparks my interest. I like him as part of the Avengers because he's not carrying the show, but on his own... I prefer bigger, faster, stronger, superer. But I wonder what happens if Captain American joins forces with the Fantastic Four??"", 'Two years after the events of The Avengers (2012), retired pararescueman Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) jogs around the Tidal Basin in Washington, D.C. Catching up to him very quickly is Steve Rogers, a.k.a. Captain America (Chris Evans). Steve completes multiple laps over Sam until the latter gets tired and sits to rest. Sam joins him and they introduce themselves. Sam is a war veteran and he knows Steve has been adjusting to life in the 21st century, and that he has a lot to catch up on. He recommends that Steve listen to Marvin Gaye\'s ""Trouble Man"" soundtrack to get up to speed on the last few decades. Steve adds it to his list, along with things like ""Star Wars/Trek"" and ""Rocky."" Steve gets a text telling him to stand by the curb in front of the Capitol. A car pulls up, driven by Natasha Romanoff, a.k.a. Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). She greets the two men and Steve hops in the car.The duo joins other S.H.I.E.L.D. agents led by Brock Rumlow (Frank Grillo) as they fly over the Indian Ocean. A S.H.I.E.L.D. vessel, the Lemurian Star, has been taken over by pirates led by Georges Batroc (Georges St-Pierre). They are holding hostages, including Agent Jasper Sitwell (Maximiliano Hernández). Steve, in his Captain America outfit, dives out of the jet armed only with his shield and no parachute. He lands in the water and climbs onto the ship, beating every goon that comes in his way. Natasha and the other agents drop down to aid Cap. The agents defeat the pirates and rescue the hostages while Batroc tries to run and is caught by Cap. They fight on the deck of the ship, with Batroc getting quickly back up on his feet even when Cap manages to take him down. ""I thought you were more than a mask,"" he says smugly. Steve removes his mask and replies, ""Let\'s find out."" He continues the fight and knocks Batroc down for good with his shield.Steve finds Natasha extracting files from the ship\'s computer using a S.H.I.E.L.D. flash drive. When Steve calls her out, she tells him she\'d been given a different mission by Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). She pulls the flash drive out, moments before a pirate runs past and throws a grenade at the two. Steve grabs Natasha and jumps through a window before it explodes.Steve is not happy with the fact that he was kept in the dark about Natasha\'s task. Upon returning to the Triskelion, S.H.I.E.L.D.\'s headquarters on Theodore Roosevelt Island in the middle of the Potomac River, Steve goes to Fury\'s office to confront him. He\'s not mollified by Fury\'s excuse--that Steve wouldn\'t be comfortable if he WAS in the loop. Fury reminds Steve that he can\'t trust anybody, even those who work closely with him. He takes Steve into an elevator down to the cavernous underground level where there are three Helicarriers being worked on as part of Project Insight, an operation that connects the Helicarriers to spy satellites used to prevent any possible terrorist attacks, and allow them to preemptively eliminate threats to national security. In part a response to the Chitauri invasion, Steve sees this as more of an aggressive form of protection. Fury insists that he get with the program.Steve visits the National Air and Space Museum, to check out an exhibit dedicated to his exploits during World War II. A child recognizes him in disguise, but Steve holds a finger to his lips asking the kid not to point him out. The kid understands and keeps quiet. Among the displays are mannequins with his World War II uniform and the costumes of Steve\'s fellow Howling Commandos, and a small exhibit dedicated to Steve\'s childhood friend Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), the only Howling Commando to have been killed in action. Steve checks out a video of his old love, Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), in which she commemorates Steve on his actions as Cap. He later visits an elderly Peggy, who has since been married and had children. She is ill and although she initially appears to recognize Steve, she slips back into a state where she believes she\'s seeing him again for the first time since he was lost, shocked to see him alive. He merely says, ""I couldn\'t leave my best girl. Not when she owes me a dance.""Fury tries to access the files that Natasha got on the flash drive, but he is unable to get past security, something that was apparently set by himself. He goes to meet with Secretary of Defense Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford) as he is meeting with the World Security Council over the matter of the hijacking of the Lemurian Star. Fury tells Pierce that they need to delay Project Insight. Pierce says \'okay\', but he wants Fury to have Iron Man stop by his niece\'s birthday.Steve visits the VA, where Sam is providing trauma counseling to other veterans suffering from PTSD. After the group meeting, Sam reveals to Steve that he lost his friend Riley in battle in Iraq after he was shot down in the air with an RPG. Despite the lost of his friend, Sam still loves flying. He asks Steve what makes him happy. He doesn\'t know.As Fury drives, he contacts Agent Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders) to rendezvous with him. As he stops at an intersection, a police car pulls up alongside Fury\'s car on his passenger\'s side. Fury notices that the officers driving the car are looking at him very suspiciously -- perhaps because he\'s a black man driving a very expensive SUV. The driver hits his siren for a quick second and pulls forward.Just as Fury pulls into the intersection, another police car appears and T-bones Fury\'s car on the driver\'s side, sending it into some bollards. The first police car suddenly stops and backs straight into Fury\'s car. A third police car simultaneously plows into Fury\'s car from behind, and several more units quickly arrive, boxing Fury\'s car in. Then a black windowless van pulls up, discharging a full SWAT team. The patrol and SWAT officers draw submachine guns and assault rifles and take up positions around Fury\'s car. The onboard computer informs Fury that there are no police units in the area, meaning that these cops are actually hired assassins.Seconds later, the assassins open fire, riddling the car with bullets. It does them no good, as the car is armored and the windows are made of bulletproof glass. With that failure, they move to their next strategy: they grab a hydraulic battering ram from their van and try to use it to break the glass on the driver\'s side window. As soon as the computer reports to Fury that the window\'s integrity level has reached 1%, Fury grabs a hidden minigun and opens fire, killing most of the assassins and destroying a few of their cars. After a prolonged exchange of gunfire, he commands the car to drive itself out. Fury\'s car takes off on autopilot with two police cars in hot pursuit.A lengthy pursuit unfolds through the streets. After forcing their way through stopped traffic, and another running shootout, two of the assassins\' vehicles catch up to Fury and begin to trade paint with him. Fortunately for Fury, his onboard computer detects a box truck about to catch up to them at the next intersection. Fury slams on his brakes, while the assassins\' cars continue on and are broadsided by the truck.Fury commands the vehicle\'s computer to get him to a safe location and speeds off. Before the computer can find a safe spot for him, he sees a figure dressed in black standing in the middle of the road. The mysterious mercenary shoots a magnetic bomb that attaches itself to the underside of Fury\'s car. It explodes and flips the car over. The would-be assassin walks over to the vehicle, ready to finish Fury off, but he escapes in time by burning a hole through the roof of the car and the street below with a laser weapon.Steve goes back to his apartment to find his pretty neighbor, Sharon Carter (Emily VanCamp), going to do laundry. He offers to let her use his machine, but she says she just spent a lot of time in the disease ward at the hospital and doesn\'t want to pass any sickness to Steve. She tells him that he left his stereo on.Steve hears music as he cautiously enters his house, grabbing his shield for protection. He finds an injured Fury sitting on his couch. Out loud, Fury says his wife kicked him out, but he shows Steve through text messages on his phone that anybody could be listening. Before he can say anything else, Fury is shot three times. Steve looks out the window for the shooter. Fury hands him the flash drive and tells him not to trust anybody. Sharon comes in, armed with a gun, and tends to Fury. Steve runs after the sniper. Steve smashes through the walls to catch up with the assassin outside. He throws his shield at him, but the sniper catches it with one swift move in his left hand, then throws it back to Steve. Steve catches the shield and is shoved back a bit and looks up, only to find the assassin has disappeared.Natasha meets up with Steve at the hospital, where they watch doctors operating on Fury. Maria joins them. The doctors try to revive him, but Fury flatlines, and presumably dies. Afterwards, Natasha asks Steve why Fury was in his apartment. He claims to not know, right as Rumlow tells him they need him back at S.H.I.E.L.D. Natasha calls Steve a bad liar, and they separate. We see that Steve hid Fury\'s flash drive behind a pack of gum in the vending machine.Steve is brought in to speak with Pierce. He also asks Steve why Fury was in his apartment, hoping to find clues to who killed him. They suspect Batroc after he was found the previous night in a safe house. Pierce insinuates that Fury hired the pirates to infiltrate the ship so that he could acquire classified information, and was then killed after the deal went wrong. Steve denies the claim. Pierce asks him again why Fury was there. Steve only says that Fury told him not to trust anybody.Steve hops on the elevator, accompanied by Rumlow and a few members of the STRIKE team. As the elevator starts down, Steve senses that he\'s walked into a trap, as Rumlow and his men have their hands on their guns. At the first stop, a couple of men in suits get on, and Steve notices that one of them is sweating profusely. Then at the next stop, a couple of burly guys get on and take up positions in front of him, blocking him in. At this point, Steve decides to let them know he knows what they\'re trying to do, prompting the men to attack him. They strap magnetic cuffs to his wrists and hold an electric stunning rod to him, but Steve overpowers them and knocks everyone out cold, Rumlow being the last to fall.Sitwell sees the fight through a surveillance camera in the elevator and orders the STRIKE team to get to the elevator. Steve breaks off the cuffs with his shield and sees the STRIKE team heading his way. He breaks off the elevator wires to send the elevator down to a lower flower. The team still approaches, so Steve breaks through the glass in the elevator, falling dozens of floors and hits the plaza, landing on his shield. He runs to the garage and rides out on his motorcycle, evading the obstacles laid out by S.H.I.E.L.D. A Quinjet emerges to shoot at Steve. He throws his shield into its engines, grounding it and giving him an opportunity to hop over it and escape.Sitwell orders S.H.I.E.L.D. agents to be on the lookout for Steve. Sharon demands to know why they\'re issuing a manhunt for Captain America. Pierce comes into the room and brands him a fugitive for withholding information on Fury\'s death.Steve goes back to the hospital to retrieve the flash drive from the vending machine, but it\'s gone. Natasha appears, chewing some gum, making clear she\'s found it first. Steve pushes her into a room and demands to know what she knows about the mysterious assassin. She and intelligence agencies only know the assassin as the Winter Soldier. He nearly killed her on a mission in Iran, during which the target she was assigned to protect was killed, and he has reportedly been responsible for over 200 assassinations over the past 50 years. They decide to use the flash drive to find out what they can on the Winter Soldier\'s whereabouts.Pierce meets with the WSC members again, defending Fury as a martyr, though they believe he was killed for trying to cover up his own illegal dealings. They all opt to reactivate Project Insight.Steve and Natasha go to a mall, disguised as a civilian couple. They take the flash drive to an Apple Store and pop it into a MacBook Pro to find the signal coming from Wheaton, New Jersey. Natasha tells Steve that they have nine minutes or less before S.H.I.E.L.D. agents find them. On the way out, the duo spots Rumlow and his men searching the place. Natasha pulls Steve in for a kiss on the escalator to draw attention away from themselves, since public displays of affection make people uncomfortable (and make faces harder to see). The ruse works and Rumlow doesn\'t spot them.Steve and Natasha drive where the signal pointed, ending up a...Camp Lehigh, Steve\'s old training base. As they arrive at the gates, Steve briefly envisions his former, smaller self running past him.He and Natasha enter the facility, which is discovered to be an original S.H.I.E.L.D. office. They find framed portraits of Howard Stark and Peggy, along with Col. Chester Phillips. Steve looks behind a bookshelf and uncovers a room full of computers. The only modern type of technology in the room is a small port for the flash drive. Natasha inserts it and activates a computer. A German voice speaks and analyzes the two. The voice belongs to Dr. Arnim Zola (Toby Jones), the HYDRA scientist responsible for building Red Skull\'s various weapons. He transferred his consciousness into a computer in 1972 when his body failed him because of terminal illness. Zola explains to the duo that HYDRA was formed on the belief that humanity could not be trusted with its own freedom, and after the war, as part of Operation Paperclip, the United States government recruited Zola and other HYDRA operatives, where they conspired against their new employers. Since then, S.H.I.E.L.D. has been nothing more than a front allowing HYDRA to continue their work, influencing history from the shadows, including various politicians and even Howard and Maria Stark. As one last bombshell, Zola reveals that this whole exposition speech of his was to stall Steve and Natasha so they\'ll be hit by a missile HYDRA has sent to take them out in less than 30 seconds. Steve and Natasha jump into a hole as the missile hits, destroying the computers. Steve protects himself and Natasha as the place crumbles. Rumlow and his men search the place to make sure there are no survivors, but the two have escaped.In his home, Pierce bids goodbye to his housekeeper, Renata (Branka Katic), just as the Winter Soldier appears in his kitchen. He never speaks a word. Pierce starts to talk to him when Renata comes back to get her phone. Remarking that he wishes she\'d knocked, Pierce shoots her twice because she\'s seen him and the Winter Soldier talking.Steve and Natasha hide out at Sam\'s home, knowing they can trust him. Natasha expresses remorse over her involvement with HYDRA agents. Sam decides to help them, but first, they need to get him equipment: a flight suit known as the EXO-7 Falcon. When he asks Steve and Natasha if they can retrieve the suit for him, they scoff, saying it\'ll be easy.Back in D.C., Sitwell walks away from a meeting with Senator Stern (Garry Shandling. Before they part ways, Stern leans in and whispers to Sitwell, ""Hail HYDRA."" At that point, he gets a phone call. It\'s Sam, standing in Sitwell\'s line of sight, who instructs him to get in a car around the corner to meet with him and his friends.Steve and Natasha take Sitwell up to the roof of a tall building. Steve holds Sitwell over the edge, threatening to drop him. Sitwell knows this isn\'t Steve\'s style. Steve agrees... and lets Natasha kick Sitwell off the roof. Sam catches Sitwell, and drops him back on the roof. Now fearing for his life, Sitwell confesses that Zola created the algorithms used by Project Insight to locate certain people around the world based on personal facts or data. The targets are picked based on their past actions, allowing HYDRA to easily track down and kill anyone who could pose a threat to them before they\'re in a position to fight back. Realizing that Pierce will likely have him killed for spilling secrets, Sitwell agrees to cooperate and go with them.As Steve, Sam and Natasha are escorting Sitwell to a secure location, they are ambushed by the Winter Soldier. HYDRA\'s assassin jumps onto the heroes\' car, yanks Sitwell out through the window, and throws him into the path of a truck. The assassin is joined by several members of the STRIKE team, who promptly ram their car into the inside guardrail. A shootout ensues as the Winter Soldier trades fire with Natasha, while Steve and Sam engage the HYDRA agents.At one point, the Winter Soldier thinks he\'s found Natasha hiding behind a car, and he shoots a rocket at that spot to draw her out, but it\'s actually just a recording played back on a phone. Natasha jumps on the Winter Soldier\'s back and attempts to garrote him from behind, but he overpowers her. She attempts to run, only for the Winter Soldier to get his gun back and shoot her in the left shoulder from behind. As he climbs onto a car and prepares to finish her off, Steve attacks him. After a drawn out fight, Steve is able to overpower the Winter Soldier with a judo throw that knocks the assailant\'s faceplate off. To Steve\'s horror, the Winter Soldier is Bucky Barnes, alive and well, and with no memory of who Steve is.Steve\'s brief hesitation is long enough for Bucky to pull a pistol on Steve, only to be taken down by a timed attack from Sam. Bucky regains his footing, and tries to shoot Steve again, but is forced to dodge as Natasha uses his grenade launcher to fire a grenade at him that takes out a nearby car. As the smoke clears, Bucky escapes while Rumlow\'s men take Steve, Sam, and Natasha into custody.Rumlow and his men load Steve and his allies into a van, intending to take them to a remote location to execute them and bury them in unmarked graves. As they come to a stop in a tunnel, Sam notices Natasha is bleeding seriously from her shoulder and tells the guards she needs assistance. One of the guards agree, and promptly pulls out an electric rod to knock out the other guard, before taking off her helmet, revealing herself to be Maria Hill. She helps them escape from the van by drilling a hole through the floor. The STRIKE team don\'t realize their prisoners are gone until they come to a stop in a storm drain and open the back doors to remove them.Maria takes the heroes to a secret facility to treat Natasha. Fury is also there, recuperating from his injuries. He survived the attempt on his life thanks to an anti-stress serum developed by Banner, originally to control his Hulk problem, but which can also allow a person to fake one\'s own death. When he and Natasha are a little more rested, they gather with the other heroes to formulate strategy. They don\'t have much time. Project Insight is set to launch within hours, at which point the three Helicarriers will form a triangle and lock sights on their targets around the globe. The people who will be targeted run the gamut between very minor and very serious threats to HYDRA. Fury takes out three chips that they will use to override the Helicarriers\' systems. He turns control over to Steve to give orders.Within a bank, the HYDRA agents work to fix Bucky\'s arm, which took damage during the fight with Steve. He has brief flashbacks to his old life, from his fall off the train to when Zola and his henchmen from HYDRA found him. His left arm was amputated and replaced with the bionic metal arm. When he began to freak out, Zola had him sedated and later put on ice, only ever thawed out when HYDRA needed him to assassinate someone. Pierce comes in, praising Bucky\'s work and asking him to come back to do it again. Bucky asks about Steve, claiming to know him. Realizing that Bucky might be getting his memories back, Pierce orders the agents to get him back to his original killing mindset.Steve stands on a bridge, reminiscing about his time spent with Bucky. A flashback shows Bucky with Steve after the funeral of Steve\'s mother. Bucky offers to let Steve stay with his family, and all he\'d have to do is shine Bucky\'s shoes. Sam comes over, prepared to join Steve in the fight. Steve tells him to suit up before going to the Captain America exhibit to get his old World War II uniform. The elderly security guard (Stan Lee) sees the suit missing and comments that he\'s gonna get fired.The World Security Council members arrive at the Triskelion, guided by Pierce. He gives them electronic pins that will give them access to anywhere in the building. Steve and Sam break into the building. Steve accesses a mic that patches him through to every loudspeaker. He tells the agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. that Pierce is a traitor who is working with HYDRA, and that they must stop Project Insight from happening. Rumlow and his goons break into the control room. He forces an agent to release the Helicarriers, but Sharon intervenes. She forces Rumlow to drop his gun. He does, then grabs his knife and cuts Sharon\'s arm. A gunfight breaks out in which most of the SHIELD technicians are killed. Rumlow, amidst the bullets, manages to release the Helicarriers himself.Steve and Sam make their way to the Helicarriers as the HYDRA agents shoot at them. Steve gets the first chip into one Helicarrier, while Sam flies around, providing cover. He manages to get a heat-seeking missile that was aimed at him to hit a Helicarrier to give him an entrance, allowing him to place the second chip there. Hill, meanwhile, monitors their progress while fighting off HYDRA agents trying to kill her.Pierce tries to convince the World Security Council members to join him in support of Project Insight, making it sound like a peaceful effort to subdue potential attacks around the world. He hands Councilman Singh (Bernard White) a glass of champagne, but Singh refuses to join him and tosses the glass. Pierce pulls out a gun and aims at Singh, but Councilwoman Hawley (Jenny Agutter) kicks Singh away, then takes down the other HYDRA goons in the room before taking the gun. It turns out Natasha took Hawley\'s place, using special technology that allows her to perfectly mimic a person\'s face. Her backup comes when Fury steps out of a helicopter, to Pierce\'s surprise. Knowing Pierce probably changed the retinal scan, Fury removes his eyepatch to reveal his scarred left eye also has a retinal scan, which enables him to override Project Insight along with Pierce, as they are the only two agents of the highest degree needed for that. Pierce sets off the pins he gave the council members, which burn deeply into each member\'s sternum. He threatens to set off Natasha\'s, forcing her to walk out with him. Natasha activates it herself, burning herself, but not as badly as the others were burned. This gives Fury the opening to shoot Pierce twice, killing him. His last words are ""Hail HYDRA.""Bucky is set loose, killing off the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents trying to aid Steve and Sam in taking down the last Helicarrier. He rips off Sam\'s wings and throws him off the Helicarrier. The HYDRA agents begin to lock on their targets, with over 700,000 and counting. Sam manages to get his parachute out, leaving him grounded. He runs back into the Triskelion to fight Rumlow. Steve confronts Bucky inside the Helicarrier, trying to get through to his best friend by reminding him that millions could die. Unwilling to listen, Bucky continues to attack. Steve runs to grab the chip and replace it, but Bucky swipes it from him. Steve manages to wound both of Bucky\'s arms, then puts him in a headlock until he releases the chip. Steve rushes to place the chip into the system, but Bucky gets his hands on a gun and shoots him, badly wounding him. Despite the injuries, Steve still succeeds in installing the chip, calling Hill to override the Helicarriers. The targets go offline, to the surprise of the dumbfounded HYDRA agents. With the systems overridden, Hill has the Helicarriers open fire upon each other. One Helicarrier crashes into a dam beneath the Triskelion. The second crashes through the Triskelion, catching Rumlow in the process. Sam runs like hell out of the window as Natasha and Fury fly their chopper in time to catch him.The third Helicarrier continues to fall with Steve and Bucky still inside. Steve chooses not to fight his friend, dropping his shield out of the Helicarrier. Bucky mercilessly punches him repeatedly across the face, even as Steve chooses to stick it out with him until the end, repeating the promise Bucky made to him long age. Before he delivers the fatal blow, Bucky looks at Steve, with hesitance, almost as if he is starting to remember. The Helicarrier crashes, throwing Steve out and sending him into the water below. He slips into unconsciousness, but not before seeing a hand reaching out for him. Bucky drags Steve to shore before walking away for good.In the aftermath, Steve recovers in a hospital as Marvin Gaye\'s ""Trouble Man"" plays. He wakes up to hear the music, and Sam holding a bedside vigil for him. Meanwhile, Sharon applies for a posting as a field agent for the CIA. Hill interviews for a job with Stark Industries. The FBI arrest Senator Stern and other various corrupt officials who took bribes from HYDRA. Rumlow is also recovered from the wreckage, alive but with terrible facial burns. Natasha is brought before a committee hearing to answer for her ties to S.H.I.E.L.D. She defends herself by saying that even if they wanted to put her in prison, they could not because the council members know they need her and her allies. She coolly walks away. Meanwhile, Fury gets rids of any trace of his existence, including his passports and eyepatch, burning them for good.Fury meets Steve and Sam at a cemetery at his own grave. On the headstone are Fury\'s name and the words ""The path of the righteous man...."" , from Ezekiel 25:17. Fury tells Sam and Steve that if anybody asks for him, they only need to come here to his grave.Fury leaves as Natasha arrives to tell the guys this is Fury\'s way of saying ""Thank you."" She hands Steve a file that he wanted, then suggests he ask out Sharon. Steve looks at the file, which concerns Bucky and his Winter Soldier transformation. Sam realizes that Steve is going to look for Bucky. Steve tells him that he doesn\'t have to go with him. Sam replies, ""I know. When do we start?""In a mid-credits scene, Baron Wolfgang Von Strucker (Thomas Kretschmann) is discussing recent events with a fellow HYDRA scientist, Dr. List, in an underground HYDRA facility somewhere in eastern Europe. Even if the American factions of HYDRA have fallen, they have many other followers around the world keeping HYDRA\'s work going. Strucker in particular is overseeing experiments on human subjects with alien weaponry, including Loki\'s scepter. As they talk, Strucker and Dr. List decide to check on the two successes that their work has produced: fraternal twins Pietro (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen). He has superhuman speed, while she has telekinesis. Observing them, Von Strucker comments, ""It\'s not a world of spies anymore. Not even a world of heroes. This is the age of miracles, doctor. And there\'s nothing more horrifying than a miracle."" The screen cuts to black as Wanda uses her powers to smash a pair of cinder blocks together.In a post-credits scene, Bucky walks through the Captain America exhibit at the Smithsonian and comes across the display of himself. He stares at it pensively as he tries to remember his past life.']"
36,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Guardians of the Galaxy,2015381,"[""Marvel Studios' Guardians of the Galaxy is a smart, funny, bright, weird and exciting movie. It's a dazzling spectacle of gloriously bizarre entertainment. It boasts of a talented cast, an awesome soundtrack and great special effects. Guardians feels at once both epic and intimate. James Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy's one of Marvel's best films to date. Rating: 9,2"", 'One of the funniest Marvel films is a comedy movie with distinction. A simple story. All the heroes of the film were excellent, especially Drax, Rocket, Groot, and Alcmestri among the heroes of the film was excellent. The music scene was great, especially Come And Get Your Love.', ""I don't know how marvel did that but man this movie was something, TBH I wasn't sure if that movie will success because It sounded like silly for me when I heard about talking raccoon and tree, suddenly they became one of my favorite characters in the MCU , Sorry marvel I was wrong."", ""First off I just wanted to say how amazing this movie is. Everything is perfect from the soundtrack, colors, characters, visuals, storyline and tone. This movie is funny but can be serious when it needs to be, the characters have actual personalities and they grow as well. The soundtrack fits and is absolutely perfect, the color scheme completely matches the tone of the movie and the storyline connects and makes sense. My only problem is probably the villain, he could come off as cliche but he wasn't that bad and was an alright villain. 9/10, definitely recommend, you don't even have to do like marvel to like this movie it's just so fun!"", ""It is a very fun and entertaining film. The story and screenplay is amazing. The direction by James Gunn is awesome. The CGI and visual effects of the film are outstanding. The film is one of the best MCU films humor wise. The performances of the cast are great. All the main characters are very likable. Definitely a must watch even if you aren't a superhero movie lover."", 'Overall, the movie just...works. The cast was great, the soundtracks were invigorating, the plot was perfect! The movie may not tell us about the origin of each of the members of the Guardians of the Galaxy, it was still capable of showing us the personality of each character, with tidbits of their own histories, while still moving forward towards how they came together as a team. This is certainly one of my favorites!', 'This film is perfect entertainment. Sheer bliss from end to end. Watch it, laugh out loud and enjoy.', ""The biggest appeal of this movie, well there isn't one. There is multiple...the colours, the music, the action and the comedy all combine to create an epic and crazily fun superhero flick. The characters are really well written and all have great chemistry with on another. Along with the dialogue this allows the characters to be quite funny and have some really strong one-liners. The villain isn't terrible either but nothing special, he's pretty much just a strong guy that works for an even stronger guy. The plot is excellent, everything fits together well and moves at a good pace which means the film is very rewatchable. The action and special effects are obviously amazing, it is a high budget marvel movie after all, what do you expect? The soundtrack tho! So good, it pairs excellently with the humour and is brilliantly placed and timed with each scene. Even the actual movie theme(not the MUSIC music) is terrifically triumphant. Coming back to the characters, what makes them so special is that each one of them has a blatantly obvious flaw that means they all have competition with each other and gives so many options when it comes to humour and overall scenes and plot."", ""James Gunn is an amazing director, and this movie certainly shows it, the settings, the music, the characters. Every character is unique with their own personality. Rocket raccoon certainly steals the show for me, he, and the rest of the movie aswell, is so strange and unique, but it's just great, amazingly executed, a great director can make the strangest concept into a great film.A lot of people complain about the villan, but in my opinion he was fine, a lot of people dont understand that a movie doesnt have to be about the villan. Ronan isnt in the movie that mutch, the movie is about the guardians of the galaxy, and how they interact and grow with eachother, Ronan served his purpose in that journy, and actually makes a funny contrast with the rest of the movie, as he is a very dark character the entire movie, but when he finaly reaches Xandar, and Peter starts dancing, and the confusion he has, oh it's just great, i love it. The outfits were great aswell, though i like rockets outfit from endgame mutch more.The music was amazing, i still listen to these songs regularly. I never grew up with this music, never heared these songs before, and they are just amazing. They fit so well into the story aswell, about his mom. Ironic even that the MCU movie with the saddest opening, also was the funniest movie.I wish i had seen this movie earlier. I encourage anyone else to give it a try aswell if they like more lighthearted movies."", 'The amount of hilariousness in this movie is unprecedented. I was very pessimistic when I first heard of this team but then I watched it and the rest is history, this is one of the best MCU movies and has some of the best MCU characters and I say that confidently!', ""I think this movie might be my favorite of all time as of now. There are so many aspects of it that are perfect to me, the most important being it's ability to connect with me emotionally.To start, the music in these films is not only enjoyable, but perfectly set with the story and mood. Each song is played with a purpose and is also played physically through some source in the film rather than just added as background music. The use of cassette tapes is genius.Maybe what this movie is most well known for is its humor. The characters come together so well in a hilarious but sincere way. Star-Lord is my favorite character but I often find myself laughing at what Drax says the most.Like I said, where this movie really stands out to me is with its heart. Each character is searching for a family, and that's what they get here. The plot weaves these stories together in a way that is both satisfying and entertaining. The final action scene where the Guardians all come together to wield the power stone gives me chills every time. It does all of this while still setting up stories for the future."", 'I love Guardians of the Galaxy so much! One of my favorite parts of the MCU!', 'Humorous, action filled, well paced. One of the better marvel films.', 'My grandkids forced me to watch this at gunpoint, but I was surprised by how much i liked it! Fun little movie.', 'The reason why this movie is good is because you have nice Introduction of another Infinity Stone, and i really love the caracters. Nice movie.', 'Absolutely just fun and full of enough action just about perfect. Chris Pratt nails it.', ""Guardians of the Galaxy is a pleasantly surprising SyFy thriller for this generation. The film stars Chris Pratt as Peter aka Star-Lord, Zoe Saldana as Gamora, Bradley Cooper as the voice of Rocket, Vin Diesel as the voice of Groot, and Dave Bautista as Drax. This all-star cast does an amazing job bringing these characters to life. If you like any of the Marvel Avengers movies you will love the humor and action of this family-friendly film. Peter is a human from planet Earth that has a bounty on his head when Rocket, a talking raccoon that was developed in a lab, and Grout a walking tree come along and try to capture him to collect the bounty on him. In the meantime, Gamora comes along trying to steal the Orb that Peter has in his possession. This group of misfits that end up crossing paths, all at the same time, end up being put into prison where they meet Drax. Drax lost his family at the hands of Gamora's gang, therefore Drax wants revenge and to kill her. This group of enemies ends up having to rely on each other to escape prison. In the beginning, they are trying to kill one another or use each other for personal gain. In order to ensure their personal gain, they end up having to try and keep one another alive. By protecting each other they begin to create a bond. I feel that the music along with the special effects that were used for this film is what makes it great. The music speaks to what is happening in the film and the emotions that the character is feeling at that time. They were consistent and the use of the music shows the time frame in which Peter left Earth. The differences in the feeling during the scenes are also shown in the lighting and special effects. The lighting and special effects during the fight scenes show quicker cuts, as opposed to the times during the film when the characters are more relaxed, in which the director pans across the scene moving with the characters. The director and the all-star cast pull the audience in and do an excellent job bringing the characters to life while leaving them asking what could be next for this group of friends. If you like humor in your SyFy films you will love this cinematic sensation."", ""I had no idea Marvel movies can be so funny! Action and comedy are actually pretty nice combined. The characters are just brilliant and the jokes are just like they should be, not too lame but not too much. The story was very good and entertaining. The only reason I don't rate this 10/10 is because Guardians Of the Galaxy vol 2 is just a bit better. I highly recommend watching this, even if you thought that Marvel movies are boring (like I did)."", ""When planning how I was going watch all these MCU films, this is one I earmarked as being one I thought I'd enjoy - not based on anything of note, I knew very little, but from the passing screenshots and such I had seen it seemed like one I'd enjoy. I'm happy to say I certainly did!'Guardians of the Galaxy' is so enjoyable. It's 121 minutes of pure entertainment. It does, at least to me, have a different feel to it when compared to the nine preceding MCU films. That's not a negative for either this or those earlier productions, it just felt different to me.I particularly enjoyed the cast, which features - as is customary at this point - a load of well known names. Chris Pratt is, probably, the perfect choice for Peter, he carries the role extremely well - his humour sticks out, but he also performs the more serious stuff nicely.Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Bradley Cooper and Michael Rooker are all thoroughly enjoyable too. Vin Diesel (kinda?) appears to portray Groot, which pleases me as someone who is a big fan of 'Fast & Furious'. There are a few others in there, including Djimon Hounsou and Benicio del Toro. Terrific cast!There is a lot to like here. I look forward to seeing the follow-ups to it."", ""I love the Marvel films and since this was different I wasn't sure. I loved it. It was equal parts action and humor. It was a nice breakaway from the seriousness of the other MCU films dealing with SHIELD and Hydra.If you're making your way through the MCU movies in timeline order and need to skip a few, please don't skip this one!"", ""It's very good. Everything about this Movie what Marvel should continue to strive doing, such as work on good Story telling, have a unique style instead of the same story over and over as well etc."", ""Guardians of the Galaxy is fun, serious, and everything in between. The introduction of the mostly all new characters is fantastic, greatly encapsulating the different facets of each's personality and abilities. The fight scenes are exciting and the visuals, between the effects and character designs, are outstanding. Comedic efforts are the highlight of the film, offsetting an extremely dire situation the characters face. The intelligent music selections featured also provide a nice edge to the movie. Marvel's future films are set up well from this wild space adventure."", 'Full of comedy action drama and one of the best movies of marvel and highly recommended to watch literally this movie is superb.', 'Guardians of the Galaxy is an instant classic and havent lost the fun I had watching it the first time back in 2014. The Characters are all incredible interesting: Rocket Racoon, Groot, Drax, Quill and Gamorrha are great as characters themself but even better together. Incredible funny and not this ""sarcastic humour"" that is in every Marvel or action movie nowadays. And also the plot with more about Infinity stones, more of Thanos and introducing the Galaxy and not only earth and Asgaard is fun and important. Favorit movie of the MCU!', 'Earth, 1988:Young Peter Quill (Wyatt Oleff) sits in the waiting room of a hospital, listening with headphones to ""Awesome Mix Tape no. 1"" on his Walkman. His grandpa (Gregg Henry) comes out and gets him so he can say goodbye to his mom, who is dying from a brain tumor. His mom gives him a present and tells him his father was an angel, and that Peter is just like him. She asks for his hand, but he\'s too scared to take it. Just then, she dies. The distraught Peter runs outside and is abducted by a spaceship.\nMorag, 2014:On the planet Morag, an adult Peter Quill, a.k.a. Star-lord (Chris Pratt), is searching for a mysterious Orb whilst listening to Awesome Mix Tape no. 1. He finds the Orb and takes it out of a laser enclosure. Almost immediately, he is ambushed by Korath the Pursuer (Djimon Hounsou) and his henchmen. After a shootout, Peter makes it to his ship, the Milano, and escapes.His father figure, Yondu Udonta, (Michael Rooker) who heads the Ravager platoon that raised Peter, calls and tells Peter to give him the Orb. Peter decides he\'s going to sell it on his own. After Peter hangs up, Yondu\'s men reprimand him for always being soft on Peter despite his constant betrayals, which Yondu brushes off, being more interested in finding out who else is interested in the Orb.Korath returns to the Dark Aster, a Kree warship led by a genocidal tyrant, Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace), who seeks to destroy the planet of Xandar after their people killed his father and grandfather. Korath reports that he failed in getting the Orb and that it\'s in the hands of Peter. Ronan wants the Orb because he can trade it to Thanos in exchange for Thanos destroying Xandar. Ronan decides to send Thanos\' daughter Nebula (Karen Gillan) after Peter, but her sister Gamora (Zoe Saldana) volunteers. Over Nebula\'s complaints, Ronan sends Gamora.On the planet Xandar, Peter takes the Orb to a broker (Christopher Fairbank) and asks what it is, because Ronan\'s goons are after it too. On hearing Ronan\'s name, the broker immediately backs out, not wanting anything to do with the orb, and removes Peter from the shop. Outside, Gamora jumps Peter and tries to retrieve the Orb herself. As they fight, they are ambushed by Rocket Raccoon (Bradley Cooper) and Groot ( Vin Diesel), seeking to claim a bounty on Peter. (Stan Lee has a cameo appearance as an old man on Xandar, chatting up a young lady. Rocket calls him a pervert.). Its not too long before Peter, Gamora, Rocket, and Groot are arrested by the Nova Corps, and after processing, are sent to a space prison called the Kyln.Pretty much everyone in prison wants to kill Gamora because she\'s the daughter of Thanos. One of the inmates, Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista), has a vendetta against her because Ronan killed his wife and daughter, so he wants to avenge them by taking the life of one of Ronan\'s family members in return. Gamora explains that she\'s not related to Ronan and she was planning on double crossing him. Peter argues in Gamora\'s favor.Meanwhile, Ronan is summoned to meet Thanos at his at his domain in an asteroid field. Ronan reports to Thanos (Josh Brolin) that Gamora is a traitor, and kills one of Thanos\'s underlings for showing disrespect to him. Thanos tells him to take care of her and get the Orb, threatening to kill him if he doesn\'t. He also notes that Gamora is his favorite daughter, which angers Nebula.Back a the Kyln, Gamora has a plan to sell the Orb to someone else. Peter, Rocket, and Groot agree to help and split the reward. Rocket has a plan to escape the prison. He needs one of the guard\'s wrist devices, a prisoner\'s prosthetic leg and a battery from a tall column in the prison. As he explains that it\'s very important to take the battery last, Groot grabs it first. The alarms go off and security droids fly in. Gamora goes to get a wrist device as Peter negotiates for the prisoner\'s leg. Drax decides to join in the escape, realizing that eventually Ronan will go after Gamora and then he can kill Ronan himself.Everyone gets the item they agreed to get, and they all make it to a guard station near the top of the prison. Rocket is surprised that Peter actually got the leg and says that he (Rocket) was only kidding, and he didn\'t really need it. Just as it seems that they have run out of time, Rocket rigs up the stuff to turn off the gravity in the prison and to use the security droids as jets to fly the guard station out of the prison. They escape, but Peter leaves the others, telling Rocket that he left something behind. It turns out that he is retrieving his Walkman with the Awesome Mix Tape from one of the guards.Yondu goes to his broker and finds out Peter still has the Orb. Threatening the broker with his arrow, he gets the man to reveal where Peter might have traveled.Everyone on Peter\'s ship gets to know one another better. They don\'t like each other at all. Soon they arrive at Knowhere (a space station built in the severed head of a Celestial) to meet with the Collector. While they wait for their appointment, Drax, Rocket, and Groot get drunk and gamble. Gamora and Peter bond over music. He explains that his mom made him the mix tape of her favorite songs. She listens and likes it. He asks her to dance, but she doesn\'t trust him. He says it reminds him of an old fable about other people who didn\'t dance, called Footloose. He makes a pass at her, but she says she\'s not one of the doe-eyed girls he\'s used to and she won\'t fall for his pelvic sorcery.Before they can meet with the Collector, Drax, Rocket, and Groot (all drunk) get into a big fight. Drax thinks Groot is dumb and Rocket is tired of people calling him a rodent. Peter talks them out of fighting. The Collector\'s assistant fetches them and they all go to meet him. Drax goes off on his own and makes a call to Ronan.The Collector (Benicio Del Toro) has a giant assortment of collectibles from all over the galaxy, including Howard the Duck and Cosmo the Soviet space dog. The Collector puts the orb into a kind of lathe, which unscrews the two halves of the Orb to reveal that it\'s a capsule for an Infinity Stone. The Collector explains that the Infinity Stones are six singularities created during the Big Bang. There are more of them and they can destroy planets. The Collector\'s assistant suddenly grabs the stone, trying to kill him. The Infinity Stone is poisoning her, and then she and everything in the area blow up. Most of the people survive, along with Cosmo. Peter and the others manage to escape with the Orb holding the Infinity Stone. They decide the safest place to take the stone is Nova Headquarters. It\'s too dangerous to be anywhere else.Suddenly the group is ambushed by Ronan and his crew, responding to Drax\'s call. Yondu\'s Ravager platoon also shows up, having tracked Peter down from the broker. Gamora, Rocket and Quill take off in single passenger ships while Nebula and some of Ronan\'s goons chase after them. Drax tries to fight Ronan, but gets beaten up badly.Nebula chases Gamora\'s ship above the atmosphere and blows it up. Nebula gets the Infinity Stone and leaves Gamora floating in space to die. Peter realizes that he can\'t allow Gamora to die, so he calls Yondu to tell him where he is, then exits his ship, and floats to Gamora, where he gives her his gas mask to keep her alive.Yondu arrives and collects Peter and Gamora with a tractor beam right before they can freeze to death. This is where we see that Yondu\'s ship is the same ship that abducted Peter as a child.Meanwhile, onboard the Dark Aster, Ronan tells Thanos that now that he (Ronan) has the Infinity Stone, he can cut Thanos out of the deal. Instead, he will destroy Xandar himself and then go after Thanos. He puts the Infinity Stone into his hammer.Back on Yondu\'s ship, Yondu is going to kill Peter for double-crossing him, but he reconsiders when Peter says that he has a plan to get the Orb back. Meanwhile on Knowhere, Drax, Groot, and Rocket decide to join forces and save Peter and Gamora from Yondu. They fly the Milano to Yondu\'s ship and threaten to blow it up with a special weapon Rocket built unless Yondu releases Peter and Gamora. Peter emerges from the crowd aboard Yondu\'s ship, and persuades Rocket that he doesn\'t need to be rescued.Now on board the Milano, Peter explains that they must prevent Ronan from touching the Infinity Stone to the ground of Xandar, which will wipe out the planet, and that he has a plan to stop Ronan. The others ask Peter if he really has a plan, or if he was lying. He says he has part of a plan. After much discussion, he says that he has 12% of a plan. Everyone scoffs, except Groot who says (translated by Rocket) that this is more than 11% of a plan. Rocket says that they will most likely die if they try to stop Ronan. Peter points out that they\'ve already lost so much, that at this point they have nothing to lose. Slowly, each of them stands up and announces that he will join the fight against Ronan.Peter warns the Nova Corps that Ronan is coming to destroy them and they should get ready, telling them that they should believe his message, because he\'s not 100% a dick.Rocket\'s idea is to blow a hole in Ronan\'s ship so Peter, Groot, Drax and Gamora can board it. Gamora is going to cut the power for Ronan\'s security and then they\'re going to blow him up with a cannon that Rocket made.They start the plan. Rocket blows a hole in the Dark Aster and then helps Yondu and his men defend Xandar against Ronan\'s fighter ships. Yondu is shot down. On the ground, told to surrender, he instead uses his arrow to take out an entire platoon of goons.On the Dark Aster, Gamora and Nebula get into a big fight, while Drax, Peter and Groot go to the bridge of the ship.Dozens of Nova ships link together to form a giant net and slow the descent of the Dark Aster. Gamora finally beats Nebula, who falls, landing on a Ravager ship and commandeers it, throwing the Pilot of the ship out the window and flying away. Ronan orders his ships to kamikaze into Xandar. Rocket and Yondu\'s men shoot as many of the ships down as they can.Almost to the bridge, Drax kills Korath. Groot grows a long thin branch and thrashes a large number of Ronan\'s men. Eventually, everyone makes it to the bridge to fight Ronan. Again, he\'s too strong for them, but Peter manages to shoot Ronan with Rocket\'s super cannon, to no avail. Rocket crashes the Milano into the bridge and seems to have destroyed Ronan. The entire ship is plummeting towards Xandar, so Groot forms a giant nest around all of them for safety. Rocket is upset because he knows that what Groot is doing will end up killing him. Groot, who up to this point has only said ""I Am Groot,"" responds with ""We are Groot.""The ship crashes. Everyone except Groot is okay. Groot is a pile of twigs strewn all about. The battle is not over though, because Ronan is still alive and well. He sarcastically calls Peter and his crew the Guardians of the Galaxy. As he raises his hammer for a final blow, Quill stands up and starts to dance to the song ""Ooh-ooh Child,"" and challenges Ronan to a dance-off. Ronan is confused, until Peter reveals it was all one big distraction, as Drax and Rocket shoot Ronan\'s hammer at Ronan, releasing the Infinity Stone. Peter grabs the stone before Ronan can. Peter starts to be affected in the same way as the Collector\'s assistant. Holding the stone is going to kill him, but Gamora tells him to take her hand. He flashes back to when he didn\'t have the courage to take his mom\'s hand, and he now grabs Gamora\'s. Drax and Rocket hold hands with the others, and the power from the Infinity Stone is spread among the four of them, causing a burst of energy that vaporizes Ronan. Rocket collects one of the sticks that was once Groot.Yondu appears and demands the Stone as per his original deal with Peter. Peter hands him the Orb. As Yondu and his men take off, one of them notes that he likes Peter and he\'s glad they didn\'t take him back to his dad like they were supposed to all those years ago.Gamora is upset that Peter gave up the stone. Peter reveals that he switched the Orbs, and he still has the one with the stone.At Nova HQ, they turn over the Orb that contains the Infinity Stone and Peter learns he\'s only half human and half something ancient and unknown. They speculate that his nonhuman genes allowed him to hold the Infinity Stone without dying.There is a party on Yondu\'s ship. His crew is celebrating but Yondu looks suspiciously at the Orb and then decides to open it. In it is a troll doll. He smiles.Peter finally opens the present his mom gave him before she died. It\'s a cassette labeled ""Awesome Mix Tape no. 2."" He asks the Guardians where they want to go. Gamora says, ""You lead, Star-lord."" He asks if they want something good or something bad. He then decides they should do something that is both. Rocket holds a pot in which he has stuck the stick that he retrieved after Groot\'s sacrifice. We can see the face of a tiny Groot on the stick.End CreditsDuring the credits, the baby Groot (slightly larger than in the previous scene) dances in his pot to Quill\'s 1980s music, with Drax in the background. The baby Groot stops when Drax looks at him, but he starts again when Drax looks away.After the credits: The Collector is sitting on the wreckage, drinking, when Cosmo the Soviet space dog comes up and licks his face. We hear a voice that says that\'s gross. The camera turns to reveal Howard the Duck sitting on a broken cage, drinking as well.']"
37,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Avengers: Age of Ultron,2395427,"[""Cool seeing them all together again, even if I didn't massively enjoy it. It's good, nothing more or less in my opinion.'Avengers: Age of Ultron' isn't too far off 2012's 'The Avengers', especially in terms of how I fell about it. I definitely wanted more from both, yet they are still satisfying superhero action flicks. I'd rank this narrowly below the aforementioned.Robert Downey Jr. felt a little flat to me as Iron Man - he still has a decent amount of moments, just not as many as you get in his individual films. All the others continue to entertain to an equally suitable level, I didn't overly like the characters of Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen but I also don't have any noteworthy negatives about them. The story between Scarlett Johansson and Mark Ruffalo didn't do much for me either.With that noted, it is still an enjoyable ride through the 141 minute run time. The ending is intriguing, interested to see where that goes - I have a minor inkling about the mid-credits scene, given all the internet attention that has had - even for someone like me who knows very little overall."", ""This film isn't nearly as bad as some people make it out to be. While the story isn't as good as the first Avengers, the acting is still just as good, the action is even better, and Ultron isn't a bad villain, he's just an under-developed one. Honestly, the action makes up for most of the flaws of this movie and it also set up a lot of MCU films, or at least foreshadowed a lot. Movies like Black Panther, Avengers: Infinity War/Endgame, and Captain America: Civil War. Overall, this isn't a bad film, at all, but it is the weakest of The Avengers franchise."", 'In 2012, there came a day unlike any other day where the worlds greatest heroes were united against a common threat and THE AVENGERS blew away audiences of all ages with the first ever comic book movie crossover. In 2015, there came another day unlike any other day and this time the world is threatened by a Ultron, the cynical critical atypical child of Skynet and Megatron...... No actually he\'s just a wisecracking artificial intelligence with delusions of godhood and all round evil. Turning on his creators, he threatens all life on earth with his sidekicks ""illusion- woman"" and ""not-the-flash""....I mean, Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver, and it is up to the Avengers to take him out before he can usher in THE AGE OF ULTRON. Instead of the robot dominated dystopian future that we saw in the comics, what we do get is more ""the next few days of Ultron"". No matter, it is an exciting few days with director Joss Whedon balancing the intercharacter dynamics with awesome action pieces from claustrophobic close combat, to a freeway chase, to the much advertised no holds barred beat down between the Hulk and iron man\'s new ""hulk buster"" Armour. All this is supplemented with beautiful special effects from Industrial Lights and Magic ILM. Flawless work befitting the movie\'s massive Budget.In The villain, Ultron, the Writers have crafted a memorable though under utilised bad guy. Ultron could have been the vehicle to explore deeper themes, themes that were merely hinted at but never fleshed out. Instead, His cynical yet refined snarling courtesy of James Spader reminds me of the those magnificently passionate Super villains that were so common in Saturday morning cartoons of old.And that is exactly what this is. AGE OF ULTRON can be described as a true live action cartoon. The dialogue is light hearted, the story is straightforward, the tone is fun and the action is immense. And this is not exactly a good thing. Intense scenes are interrupted and spoilt with poorly placed humour and once again the story does not seem to take itself seriously. Fights are over-choreographed, more like some fancy ballet than an all out battle. The fact that it cuts to graceful slow motion once in a while only emphasises the dance like nature of the fights. And yet the movie felt like pieces of it were cut out. The narrative does not flow as smoothly as the first with inexplicable scenes like Thor suddenly going off on his hallucination trip. Much of the premise and the characters development up to this point very much depends on the viewer watching prior marvel movies. It is here that Marvel studio\'s continuity heavy Creative direction rears its ugly head. To know what is going on in this movie, one would have to watch the previous movies. Captain America the winter soldier, iron man 3, the first avengers movie. But perhaps that\'s the point? Force people to go buy the Blu rays or the video to rewatch and get up to speed. In the end, the real big winner is distributor Disney. Ka-Ching $$.I like a good comedy. In in a big action blockbuster, I like to believe that the stakes are real, that the dangers faced by our heroes are real, that they are really fighting for the fate of the world. Instead, we get this cartoony violence, with equally cartoony superficial story, where heroes joke around with quick lighthearted quips in the middle of a fight scene where people could die. This kills tension. And if it weren\'t for the magnificent effects, action and direction, AGE OF ULTRON would have scored a bit lower.', 'The task of bringing together Earth\'s mightiest heroes took Joss Whedon into uncharted territory with 2012\'s ""The Avengers,"" and, despite the weight of the Marvel Cinematic Universe on his shoulders, the results were staggeringly entertaining. The task of making a sequel to that ground-breaking, monumental event film, however, and being expected to deliver on par or better results, is an entirely different beast.""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" was definitely built on the bullet point takeaways of ""The Avengers,"" which are: Make time and space for wit, banter and humor for the sake of humor to prevent the film from taking itself too seriously; give each character a story arch and independent moments; choreography clever action sequences with well-timed glory shots. These components are in full force in ""Ultron"" and make enjoying the blockbuster as easy as shoving a lollipop in your mouth.Yet ""Ultron"" is infinitely more complex than its predecessor. The number of heroes featured barely fits into a single action figure play case, meaning more subplots and back story, in addition to creating an arch of the creation and life of Ultron itself. With a plot that takes the Avengers from the eastern European country of ""Sokovia"" to New York to the African nation of ""Wakanda"" to Seoul, South Korea to Sokovia again, much of ""Age of Ultron"" is a non-stop blur.The film opens with the Avengers leading an assault on a secret HYDRA facility where they have located the staff that Loki used to lead the Chitauri invasion in ""The Avengers."" When they secure it and bring it back to New York, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) discover that its power source contains a blueprint for artificial intelligence, which would allow Stark to proceed with his Ultron project, an initiative to create peace-keeping robots that could defend the world in place of the Avengers should another alien invasion occur. When Ultron (voiced by James Spader) becomes conscious, however, he interprets his peace-keeping instructions as an imperative to wipe out humankind.Added to the mix are the Maximoff twins, Pietro (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Wanda (Elizabeth Olsen) – also known as Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch – who decide to serve Ultron, with the latter using her powers to give each of the Avengers dangerous visions that could tear them apart.The fight scenes and action sequences are in such abundance in ""Ultron"" that it\'s impossible to remember them all, and the ones that are most distinct, such as Iron Man chasing down and taming a rampant Hulk using his Hulkbuster armor, are ancillary to the narrative of finding what Ultron is up to and stopping it. In other words – it\'s all for show. The creativity of the fight choreography also gets lost in the whirlwind of action. Captain America (Chris Evans) probably does 12 different awesome things with his shield, but they happen so fast you\'ll be hard pressed to recall any one of them in detail. Really clever sequences are only as fun as the build-up and payoff and those pieces are given no time to breathe.Whedon does allow for pauses in the chaos, such as the swanky Avengers Tower party featuring the film\'s best scene, when each Avenger tries his hand at lifting Thor\'s hammer, or a quiet retreat to an unexpected safe house in the countryside, but it\'s simply a trade- off: instead of busy action sequences, we get character relationship dynamics and back story.""Ultron"" is inundating, to be frank, but for the everything-but-the-sink mentality, it\'s carried by its sense of humor and a cast whose members have each proved themselves time and again to be magnetic both on their own and as part of this team. Some of the novelty has worn off, but seeing all these characters together remains a treat that even the most convoluted of stories cannot entirely dismantle. Marvel Studios truly proves with ""Ultron"" the credibility that it has built with fans, to the point that even when it gets a little ambitious and mettles a bit more (you can easily see Whedon at odds with them in this final cut), its reputation remains intact and the fans placated.As ""Phase III"" begins, adding even more characters to Marvel\'s cinematic universe (and even sliding Spider-Man into the mix) en route to the two-part ""Avengers: Infinity War"" slated for 2018 and 2019, it will be interesting to see if Marvel Studios barrels along into more unwieldy but delicious chaos, or reins it in a touch. Either way, should be fun.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more', '""People stopped being people in 1913. That was the year Henry Ford put his cars on rollers and made his workers adopt the speed of the assembly line. At first, workers rebelled. They quit in droves. Now we plug right into repetitive motions of a hundred kinds."" - Jeffrey Eugenides Produced by Marvel Studios (now a subsidiary of the Walt Disney Company), ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is a gazillion dollar superhero movie. Most of the film consists of dull, unimaginative action sequences in which powerful ""good warriors"" battle powerful ""bad warriors"". These action sequences - which have no sense of style, tempo and which are totally devoid of tension - are rolled out like crude, Pavlovian commands; the chemical rushes cynically demanded by corporate candy factories.Breaking up the monotony of these monotonous actions sequences are equally monotonous and equally mechanical scenes in which our heroes ""talk"", ""reveal their personalities"" and ""share their feelings"". These scenes exist, not because Marvel Studios has any interest in drama, characters or continuity, but because ""films are supposed to have these scenes"". In the Marvel universe, nothing really matters. The individual plots and over-arching plot lines of Marvel\'s films don\'t matter. Characters don\'t matter. These things are only present to present the illusion of storytelling. They are filler. The constituents of a factory assembly line whose sole goal is the procurement of money.You can\'t have a Marvel Movie without a super-villain. This time around our villain\'s a Really Bad Guy who wants to do Really Bad Stuff and who ironically pokes fun at Conventional Movie Villain Dialgoue whilst actually totally adhering to clichés. This villain (spoiler?) is defeated. Along the way, the film ""comically"" delivers its obligatory ""one swear word"", but not before a room full of lawyers and marketing executives run up the data, salivate over pie-charts and double check with global ratings boards.Marvel Studios has a history of roping in ""irreverent"" and ""edgy"" directors. Afterall, you can\'t sell cookie cuttered dough to zombies without pretending it\'s the work of a rebel. As such, ""Age of Ultron"" was directed by Joss Whedon, a geek-king with a flair for zany dialogue. But like Tarantinospeak, Woody Allenspeak, Mametspeak and Coenspeak, Joss Whedonspeak is now officially annoying. Indeed, everyone in Whedon\'s ""Ultron"" now sports the same voice. Every character, be they villain, hero, co-star, robot or computer, is an ironic, sarcastic, wisecracking master of zany one liners. This orgy of flippancy, non-sequiturs and ""cool dialogue"" reeks of desperation; cool stops being cool when everyone speaks cool.Watching most Marvel Movies is a bit like being forced to watch a pornographic movie for a full two hours past the point of ejaculation. ""Ultron"" in particular bludgeons you with bludgeoning. It\'s filled with CGI muscle-men pounding and stomping, blowing up buildings and tossing cars back and forth, and then doing it again, and again and again and again, and then again in the sequels and then again on the directors\' cuts, and then again in the reboots, and then again in the reboots\' sequels and then again and again. And then a few more times. And then again and again.Today, Marvel Studios now rolls like one of the world\'s largest conveyor belts; factory film-making as the epitome of the self-perpetuating capitalist machine, repackaging and marketing to every inch of the world. Art subservient to product cycles, product obsolescence and schizoid brains. And all the while, the Studio keeps expanding, pushing their movies in the summer, their TV shows in the fall/winter, and their streaming shows in the spring before the cycle is repeated all over again. With the new mantra of #ItsAllConnected - ironic, considering no Marvel show/series meaningfully connects to another - Marvel moves like the cinematic equivalent of malware. And now that Disney\'s acquired the ""Star Wars"" franchise, we can expect it to similarly start squeezing new ""Star Wars"" movies out of its mechanical orifices like diseased clockwork.Incidentally, like most recent Marvel movies, ""Age of Ultron\'s"" chief villain is essentially a Western defence contract run amok. So we have another ""anti violence"", ""anti military"" Marvel film which gets its kicks from violence, mass murder and the flattering of whole cities. Lazily written and acted, the film finds actor Mark Ruffalo continuing to be excellent, soulful and layered. He plays the Hulk, a property damage loving green dude with magical pants.3/10 – What was Ultron\'s age anyway? Was that dude even legal? Worth no viewings.', ""being a huge Marvel fan, and also Josh Whedon fan I was super excited for him to come back and do another Avengers movie. The first film was pretty brilliant. But with this film, Whedon wasn't given much air to breathe, with constant Studio interference and orders of certain shots to be re- done, or scrapped if not worse. Put in.So, you thinking why is this film so bad, if you are a fan, you should love it. Well the film changes pace, very quickly and abruptly, which is a poor sign of movie making. The Characters do not act like they would usually act in the same scenario, the progression of the story is all over the place, Scene's that just have no weight or meaning to the film, but in there because it looks cool or is setting up another independent super hero movie, the Villain that is so smart, but doesn't use the internet and his ability to control everything just to wipe out everybody, but rather has this ridiculously stupid plan. The Hero's that are suppose to be smart, intelligent and some what Spanish do not see all of the stupid plot hole that get infiltrated. The fighting was also a problem for me, it was the same. Once you saw it in the first Avengers, you see exact same thing in the second one too, and it doesn't even change a little.Overall, this film is bunched up due to the constant interference by Studio as Josh has stated so many times now."", 'Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) is a MARVEL damn good superhero flick and an excellent sequel! Yes it is miles way better than Jurassic World and Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Terminator Genisys I have enjoyed this film much better than Jurassic World, Star Wars and Terminator the new movies. This film is fun, popcorn, Action and entertaining action sequel flick. I like the first one but I love this one much more. The first time I watch it, I did not like this film at all, it did not work for me, but the second time around this flick was awesome and it become one of my favorite MARVEL superhero movies. I love this film so much, more than the first Avengers. James Spader made the movie for me! So much better than Loki. James Spader and Robert Downey Jr. played together in a teen movie Tuff Turf in 1985 and 30 years later they teamed together to star in a MARVEL comic book super hero film. I like Tuff Turf but Avengers: Age of Ultron is far way better film to me. I love this film so much and I will never get the backlash. Joss Whedon gave me everything I wanted in a sequel. This and the first film are in my top 10 films of all time. I waited a long time for this universe and I am loving every minute of it. Superhero movies come out all time but something like this is what I love about movies. Plot: Tony Stark creates the Ultron Program to protect the world, but when the peace-keeping program becomes hostile, The Avengers go into action to try and defeat a virtually impossible enemy\'s to get. Earth\'s mightiest heroes must come together once again to protect the world from global extinction. I really enjoy this movie I don\'t get the backslash and a lot of people were disappointed with this sequel that it is not so good as the first film. Age of Ultron is in my top 3 favorite comic book films. Number 1 will always be Captain America: The Winter Soldier and number 2 will be Captain America: The First Avenger, I just love those two films: Captain America is my favorite superhero character in MARVEL comic books. Captain America in this movie is the most decent hero in this movie, he did not want the leave the island with people stuck on it, he refused too, I have seen a hero in him. People are keep getting upset over Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), ""oh look what they did with Black Widow."" I saw the film and I am seeing her kicking ass or calm down the Hulk, which is a pretty ballsy thing to do. Specially for someone who has no balls and she is kicking ass and driving motorcycle, driving around shooting for Cap, helping them to get vision android to beat Ultron and she is the only one with no powers, except Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), she has the to get the thing for them. I think it would be weird to kidnapped Thor, if you put Thor in the scene duh. I enjoy this movie much more than the first film, the first film I liked okay, I like the first Avengers film. This is a fun popcorn entertainment flick that I really love. I like the romance between Black Widow with Hulk it was really good fast paced entertainment. I love Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff / Scarlet Witch I like the twist by the end of the film that she turn her side around when she found out that Ultron wants to destroy everything on this planet I love that. You have Aaron Taylor-Johnson in it from Kick-Ass film as Pietro Maximoff / Quicksilver sadly he dies on the end of the film, but he saves Hawkeye and a kid from Ultron firing bunch of bullets on them I thought that was pretty decent in the film. In my opinion Aaron Taylor-Johnson did a good job playing his character. I love that they return Samuel L. Jackson to the movie back as Nick Fury and that he help them out fighting Ultron. James Spader did a terrific excellent job playing Ultron.Avengers: Age of Ultron is a 2015 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team the Avengers, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is the sequel to 2012\'s The Avengers and the eleventh film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). You have a lot of action in it, I also love that Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, Thor, Bruce Banner (Hulk), Natasha Romanoff, and Clint Barton work together after Ultron failed to destroy them and they go in to safe house to Clinton\'s family, I like that. When Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) touches Black Widow, Iron Man and Thor I like that you see a background of Natasha Romanoff\'s childhood, I like that. I love the African shipyard you see them on a ship and I love the last stand. I love that the Vision helps Avengers to destroy and stop Ultron from extinction. Btw I love to death Black Widow / Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) she is so beautiful and charming I love her. Overall: I am giving this flick 10 out of 10 for me Age of Ultron is my #3 favorite super hero movie. I can\'t wait for the next movie: Captain America: Civil War.', ""One user nailed it... underwhelming. What also really bothered me was Ultron's voice and character. Seemed too childish and immature for a villain. His humor was also cheesy.Still a decent film, but certainly not one of my favorite Avengers films.7/10 from me."", 'Can this film possibly ""not"" succeed? No. Even if it were a bomb (which it is most definitely not) tens of millions of fans would see it anyway. So it was a guaranteed hit. Nice work if you can get it.Best line? ""I support your avenging."" (Mrs. Hawkeye)Second Best line? ""You get hurt. Hurt em back. You get killed. Walk it off."" (CA)Third Best? ""Well I was born yesterday."" (you know who)Honorable mention? ""Beep beep"" (Natasha on her cycle, mimicking her horn, trying to warn pedestrians)Why did Spader get the Ultron gig? Because of his incredible work in Blacklist. (See it)What\'s the best part of this (somewhat long) movie? The back-and-forth between the characters, a Whedon trademark. And of course the action scenes. Possibly the best ever filmed.What\'s the worst part? The 40 minute ""dead zone"" after the Bond-style opening, where the Avengers try to make like it\'s Happy Hour at the local bar.Which actor consistently shines? Downey. He is the smartass each of secretly wants to hang out with.Which actor suffers the most in group play? Thor. The gravitas of being a God gets lost in team work.Name a massively over-exposed actor who finally got under-exposed? Sam Jackson.What could we have lived without? ""Explaining"" to the audience why characters like Pepper Potts were ""unavailable"" for the story (or possibly too expensive even for a quick cameo)What is Whedon\'s greatest enhancement to the Marvel backstory? The romance between Natasha and Hulk.What is Whedon\'s strangest tweak? Killing Pietro. The boys at the X-Men franchise will not be happy.Is this a better movie than AV1? No, but it is just as good. (It tries harder but has pacing issues).Who wins at the end? The studio. And Joss Whedon who BOTH wrote and directed what could be the biggest money-maker in history. Somewhere in Hollywood, JJ Abrams is actually getting nervous.-------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATED Jan 16 -- OK, so JJ deconstructed the original Star Wars script scene by scene (something no one else had ever bothered to do) and rebuilt it into the 2015 relaunch of Star Wars. And nailed it. The viewer experience, the pacing, is dead-on. And oh by the way produced the fastest film in history to hit 1.0 billion in ticket sales. So disregard the last line of the original review above. JJ is no longer nervous.', '...Phase 2 of the Marvel movies had been batting .500 for me. I did not enjoy Iron Man 3 or Thor: Dark World, but really dug Guardians of the Galaxy and Captain America: Winter Soldier (Cap 2 is probably the best film in the entire Marvel series!)Based on that, I don\'t think I am surprised that I came out of Age of Ultron with mixed feelings. Overall it is a solid entry, but it is by no means flawless. The good:Really liked the intro of Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver. I liked the horror-movie tropes tied to Scarlet Witch (she is a Witch afterall!) and Aaron Taylor-Johnson\'s Quicksilver had a lot of personality.The action, of course, was great. And Hawkeye actually had something to do in this film. The Vision: They did such an incredible job building mystique around this character.The Bad:Wasn\'t a fan of that extended scene at the Farm. That stopped the movie cold. I know some people say ""It was necessary for character development"", but the previous films had done such a poor job of giving Hawkeye any character that seeing him on the Farm did absolutely nothing for me.The romance: Ugh. Talk about forced. I like Ruffalo\'s Banner. I really do. I was surprised how much i did in the first Avengers, cause i\'m usually not a Ruffalo fan. But I just did not see any chemistry between Ruffalo and Scar-Jo. And where was the build-up to this? Last time we saw these 2 together Hulk was trying to smash Black Widow. Marvel needs to work on their female-story lines.Ultron was kind of a lame villain. I don\'t think there was enough build-up for him. He just sorta showed up and was evil.Overall: Is it worth seeing in the theatre? Yes of course it is. But it is not without its flaws, and sure doesn\'t top Cap 2.', ""I really should keep up on Superhero movies . But there's a reason I don't - I simply don't like them . They personify everything I dislike about modern Hollywood blockbusters , lots of explosions , lots of stunts and lots of CGI . It's less like watching a film and more like logging on to youtube and watching gameplay of the latest state of the art computer game AVENGERS AGE OF ULTRON gets off to the exact start I'm talking about . Most of the iconic Marvel Superheroes - and the audience are thrust in to an opening action sequence . It's very vague what this mission is , something about East European baddies in league with Hydra working on some artificial intelligence . Ignore the narrative because the opening involves lots of stunts , ramping and explosions with the occasional one liner thrown in . You want action you've got it . You want intelligent , stimulating storytelling ? Go and read a book . I can understand what the producers are pandering to but I found this pre-title sequence rather uninvolving and the rest of the film continues in the same way One thing the film does try and do is merge high concept action with character driven moments . On paper it does have a relatively good cast and it'd be a pity to waste it on overblown action but it's not really an actors type of film and while the production team deserves some credit for trying to concentrate on character but it's not developed enough to be entirely successful and comes across as rather shallow Despite this short review I'm big enough to stick up my hand and say this movie isn't produced for grumpy , middle aged men like myself , it's produced for younger people who can't get enough superhero movies and for this market the prospective audience will probably love it so much so that that'll be a contender for biggest grossing film of 2015 and we'll be getting more Marvel movies for the foreseeable future"", ""Spoiler free review. Let me first start of by saying that I am not a Marvel ''fanboy'' or a DC nerd. The comic book genre of films have made it to my personal top 3 favourite genres in the last decade and the MCU has been a strong contributor to that rise. I hold the first Ironman, first Avengers and Captain America 1+2 in high regard. I did not like the direction they took with Iron Man 3 (more on this below) or Guardians of the Galaxy but Winter Soldier was a gem in terms of balancing solid action, drama and levity.That being said, my initial thoughts on Age of Ultron (AoU) are quite negative. To me, its essentially a carbon copy of IM3. There are problems which strike you repeatedly as you progress throughout the film. The 2 biggest complaints I have with AoU is 1) the tone (comedy) 2) the script/writing.So starting with the tone. I like to laugh as I'm sure most people do, but there is a time and place to exhibit your comedy writing skills in an action film. In AoU, its a constant, recurring and predictable theme. It's not limited to one character either, everyone is popping one liner jokes as if its the Expendables and yes, most are not funny. The timing of these moments of levity are horrible too, desensitising the viewer to any impending fear of death in battle. If the characters seem so relaxed in not worrying about possibly dying, then what suspense is needed to be held by the audience? This plagued IM3 in a bad way and its arguably worse here. The comic book films which achieved great success in this regard were XMen DOFP, The Avengers 1, Cap 2 even Dark Knight Rises! Can you imagine at the climax of Xmen DOFP if old Magneto and Storm and Bishop start pulling one liner jokes as the army of sentinels came charging at them? It would kill any tension! 2) The script. I won't say too much since this is a spoiler free review, but it really feels rushed and unorganised. I watched Fast 7 around 2 weeks before AoU and I got similar vibes. Again, its not the fact that the film is 2.5 hours long or has too many characters, that isn't am excuse since The Dark Knight and Xmen DOFP shows how to navigate these theatrical obstacles. There are a few completely unnecessary subplots in AoU and useless characters which do not impact the story overall. The villain himself, Ultron is another massive let-down in Marvels already growing catalogue of mishandled villains.So as a summary, if you want mindless action and cool CGI, which this film does offer in the form of some spectacular visual fight scenes then you will like AoU. If you are after a darker, grounded and more moving story like the trailers promised, you will be severely disappointed. Final score 6/10 and I am being kind since Cap is my fav Avenger and they finally gave him some good screen time."", 'As I was watching this movie today, I realized it\'s one of the most important film in mcu. It has tons of elements that are used heavily in future MCU films, egFleshing out Hawkeye°In this film we get to see the other side of Hawkeye, we learn about his family, who would played a vital role to his character\'s dark turn in Endgame.°This movie also solidifies his relationship with Black Widow which makes her demise in endgame even more impactful.°He also inspired Wanda to shake off her past and become an Avenger. The arising tension between Steve and Tony° Things started to get sour between Steve and Tony, after him and Bruce accidentally created Ultron and also Vision. And the destruction of Sokovia at the end of the movie is also one of the main reason for the Sokovia Accords, which are all part of the reason that split the superheroes in two sides in CW. Intro of Scarlett Witch and Vision°Vision and Scarlett are both introduced in this film, and they both would go on and become crucial members of the Avengers.Thanos had enough° The events of this film upset Thanos so much that he decided to ""do it himself"" which foreshadows the event of Infinity War. Avengers as a unit°It\'s also the first appearance of the Avengers functional as a team. They\'re not just meeting and building the team like in the first Avengers, they aren\'t split like in Civil War and Infinity War or broken like in Endgame. They\'re just out there taking on bad guys, hanging out, and fighting evil robots. Hulk/Bruce banner story arc°Bruce Banner started having problems transforming into the Hulk in this movie which keeps recurring in Infinity War, until ultimately resolved at Endgame.°Hulk buster armor°At the end of this film, Hulk left on the quinjet which from there, you know, Ragnorak. Wakanda/ Black panther tease°Klaw is first introduced in this film, he would go on to become one of Black panther\'s main villain. Wakanda and vibranium are mentioned as well. Black widow\'s arc°Flashback scenes of Black Widow\'s years of training might be further explored in the her upcoming solo movie.Ragnarok:°Heimdall first teases Ragnarok and the fact they will lose in Thor\'s vision, which prompted him to fly back home to Asgard. Ironman to save everyone°The visions of defeat he saw in this film haunt him, but he was, in the end, able to use that fear to defeat Thanos in Endgame, thus saving everyone. °Captain almost picking up Mjolnir.°The first mention of the word ""Endgame"". At the time of its release it was met with mixed reviews mostly because it was too muddy, yeah it had to to tell its own story, all while setting up the next four years of Marvel films. This movie deserve nothing but our utmost respect. 🙌', 'So everybody must be asking now: ""Is it worth watching more than two hours of this just to get to the obligatory Thanos end credits scene?"" and the answer is... yes. Besides making fun of War Machine - again - and completely ignoring characters like Pepper Potts and Falcon, there was nothing that bothered me tremendously about this film. Keep in mind that it is a comic book film with superheros that dress funny, though.The villain is pretty menacing, the interaction between the Avengers goes well beyond killing enemies in each other\'s blind spot and the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver addition was interesting, though kind of condescending. I mean, if they want to ban Tin-tin cartoons for racist depictions of African people, they should stop at one moment or another inventing countries with Slavic names and filling them with helpless women and children with names just as ridiculous and toy soldier police and army forces. I am just saying.What I thought was better than I was expecting from an Avengers movie were the underlying character stories. Thanks to Scarlet Witch we see bits of our heros\' histories, we get to know Hawkeye a little better and understand his role in a team of superpowered individuals, he see the romantic side of Black Widow and the Hulk... yes, you read that right... and we get to see Captain America and Tony Stark having ideological arguments that divide the team. Of course, they carry them with vibranium shield throws and energy beams, like men do... don\'t they?I loved the character of The Vision, a freak hybrid between a servile AI and a full psycho AI, holding the power of an Infinity Stone and having a 3D printed body that is half alive, half vibranium. I share his view of humanity as queer pets that you have to enjoy during their short life.What I didn\'t like is that they upped the ante of what the Avengers can do, just because they could. In the end this diminished the level of empathy that one can feel for superhumans like that and removed from the quality of storytelling. Also, another film in which artificial intelligence builds bodies and kills people. Why would it? Ultron\'s motivation was completely unexplored and his philosophy and references to Pinocchio made no sense at all. OK, it was meant to be insane, but even insanity has purpose and sense. Overall, I think the biggest problem with the film was that it had too much of a budget.Bottom line: brainless fun, but fun nonetheless. Less humor than expected, with Ultron teasing an interesting character with his jokes, but then devolving to a classic villain in the sea of special effects that filled most of the movie. You get to know the Avengers more, as well, which was nice.', ""It's quite an achievement to make a boring Superhero Movie so well done to all involved.Remember the first average at best Avengers Movie? A baddie in control of the Tesseract uses it and an alien army to try and take over the planet. Whilst this is happening the Avengers are brought together where there are a few internal issues involving having their minds controlled &/or beating each other up, before joining forces to beat the alien threat.Well.... This movie is about a baddie who was in control of the Tesseract which then becomes the catalyst for a new robot baddie and it's robot army trying to destroy the planet. This again creates a few internal issues involving the Avengers having their minds controlled &/or beating each other up, before joining forces to beat the robot threat. It's just the same movie repackaged (again) which tries to be intelligent but comes across as dull. Some of the Avengers presence have little or no no point in being in the movie (Hawkeye just being there for example to offer the others a weekend retreat to go to).But as with the first movie and the upcoming Captain America: Civil War it seems as long as the movie is crammed full of as many Superheroes as possible and they all kick off at some point during the movie, then this is enough to keep an audience happy.Stick with the X-Men at least they make an effort!"", 'The Avengers raid a Hydra base in Sokovia commanded by Strucker and they retrieve Loki\'s scepter. They also discover that Strucker had been conducting experiments with the orphan twins Pietro Maximoff (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), who has super speed, and Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen), who can control minds and project energy. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) discovers an Artificial Intelligence in the scepter and convinces Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) to secretly help him to transfer the A.I. to his Ultron defense system. However, the Ultron understands that is necessary to annihilate mankind to save the planet, attacks the Avengers and flees to Sokovia with the scepter. He builds an armature for self-protection and robots for his army and teams up with the twins. The Avengers go to Clinton Barton\'s house to recover, but out of the blue, Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) arrives and convinces them to fight against Ultron. Will they succeed? ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is an entertaining adventure with impressive special effects and cast. The storyline might be better, since most of the characters do not show any chemistry. However, it is worthwhile watching this film since the amazing special effects are not possible to be described in words. Why Pietro has to die is also not possible to be explained. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Vingadores: Era de Ultron"" (""Avengers: Age of Ultron"")', 'This movie takes a long time to gain any steam, with a lot of all talk and no action in the first half of the movie. There is also little suspense and intrigue - just the superheroes pondering and conjuring their next mission, with Tony Stark and Bruce Banner creating a project called Ultron to act as a peacekeeping program serving as the movie\'s backdrop.The Ultron project goes horribly wrong and the machine takes a mind of its own, threatening to rid the world of humans in attempts to ""save the world"" - something we\'ve heard before.We get to see action slowly trickle in during the second half of the movie slowly - lots of crazy CGI action during the rumbling climax. This film\'s plot sets the story for the next film, Captain America: Civil War, in motion. However, I thought this film overall lacked the entertainment value due to its extremely slow plot and lackluster story.Grade D', ""I loved the first one, 10/10. This one was just missing something. It had all the ingredients. I think it was the main villain. I'm not a fan of James Spader's smug voice so maybe that's why I didn't enjoy it. There was way too much CGI. It was very well done, just too much of it. Also I didn't get a lot of reason why Ultron did what he wanted to do. He just did it with little explanation.Also where were the laughs? There are usually some well placed lines in these films but I didn't see many.Solid sequel though."", 'The Avengers assemble once again go up against a new corrupt, A.I. Ultron (James Spader). As the troupe pursue their mission, we\'re given a deeper understanding of our favorite super heroes. There are not enough words in the world to express how happy I am. As a Marvel fan, this film showcases some of my favorite comic book characters together in one plot line in a bigger and better way. When you are dealing with a sequel, as a filmmaker, you\'re pretty much trying to top yourself. Thankfully, the filmmakers have out done themselves here. We\'re given a superior conflict, more characters and action beyond epic proportions. I love this movie not only because it\'s a phenomenal Marvel film, but also an outstanding film in general. A movie is supposed to grab the audience and transport them to a universe with characters that not only we look up to but also identify with. Marvel has successfully created this reality. Every time I see a Marvel logo on a movie poster I\'m excited to be sent back, once again, into their universe. Marvel is a genius entertainment company because they establish their characters in previous films. The Avengers are the protagonist. Every character is given their moment in the lime light but, they are not the main focus. They all share the screen and have their own personal conflict, yet they respond as team. That is not to say that there is no character development, there is. Former story lines help save time so that the writers can focus on perfecting the current story. This also leads to much stronger relationships between the characters. For people who have no history with Marvel films, I suggest that you see some of the previous films that feature the Avengers. The reason is that you may miss a connection with the characters that can be resolved by watching previous films. Although you will enjoy the action and story even without seeing the previous films, the inside jokes and interactions between characters become funnier when you understand the past. The action in this film is awesome! The word awesome is a very primitive word, but it explains everything. While I love to go to the movies and appreciate storytelling and 3 dimensional characters, there are times when I just want to see things go boom! Every Avenger, with his or her different abilities, works together and kicks butt. An example of this is when Thor hits Captain America\'s shield and causes a devastating explosion. You have to see it to believe it.My favorite character is, Vision (Paul Bettany) an android created by Ultron. Bettany is originally the voice of J.A.R.V.I.S., Tony Stark\'s (Robert Downey, Jr.) A.I. companion. Bettany uses his fantastic voice to create Vision. I was excited when I heard he was going to be a new addition to the Avengers team. Not only is the acting and personality spot on, but the costume design is beautiful. There are so many scenes that I adore, but my favorite is when the Avengers, ""get acquainted"" with Vision for the first time. This is the second A.I. the group has encountered and they\'re unsure if they can trust him. Vision is uncertain himself and gives a speech on why it doesn\'t matter because they all want to stop Ultron. At the end of his speech there is a comedic pay-off that shows which side Vision is truly on. The moral of the film is, ""The way to peace is not destruction."" Ultron is built for one reason - to create peace in our time. Ultron is confused on how to fulfill that mission and believes the only way to achieve his goal is to wipe out the human race and start over. However, Ultron underestimates the soul of man. I give this 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it to 11- to 18 year- olds. There is language and intense action that younger kids might not be able to handle. Check out this film in theaters May 1 and remember, a true Marvel fan stays to the end of the credits.Reviewed by Keefer B., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

For two hours, I can forget everything that sucks about the real world and enjoy watching earth's mightiest, (and gosh darn it funniest) heroes (you're welcome Cap for not using the other word). I've always been more of a DC guy, but Marvel movies are just pure entertainment. Joss Whedon may have given us the funniest Marvel movie yet. Whether it was the Thor hammer gag about getting 'it up' or not, Captain America's bad language issues, or Hawkeye poking fun at himself, Age of Ultron was incredibly fun. To top all that, and the first film, Ultron is loaded with action that feels like it's straight out of the comic books.We open with the Avengers mid mission taking down Baron Von Strucker and the experimented on Maximoff twins. As the camera seamlessly weaves through the entire team we get Brian Tyler's brilliantly mixed score, which I was thrilled to hear they salvaged some of Silvestri's theme, that goes with each character. It was like the assemble moment from the first film was happening again within the first 5 minutes, you just don't get much better than that. We quickly get introduced to Scarlet Witch's nightmarish powers with Tony seeing his future of the Avengers dying at his own hands. I do feel like that's a quick nod to Civil War and the possibility of the team going separate ways. Iron Man started it all, so it does seem like the beginning to the end. Throughout the film we get to see different nightmare sequences that give us glimpses of Heimdall played by Idris Elba and the Ragnarok storyline. With Cap we briefly saw Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter and a little bit of the dance we never got to see. Finally with Black Widow and her harsh upbringings as an assassin. On a side note it was cool seeing Julie Delpy in the flashbacks.Onto the possibly the most fun segment of the film, the party scene. Not only did we get several laugh out loud jokes, we had jokes that I missed because everyone was still laughing from before. I'm not even sure Guardians was able to do that. The scene with Thor's hammer was especially entertaining. The look on Thor's face when Cap is able to slightly move it was priceless. Ultron's entrance is terrifying but also sort of funny? I wasn't expecting the humor to Ultron, and I'm not sure I needed it. Don't get me wrong James Spader was fantastic as the voice, but I think at times it didn't fit. The film does indeed go from one action scene too another, and if this isn't your type of movie, I don't blame you if it feels tiresome. But it never bored me as I don't think there will be a more fun movie this year. It's not like action is all we got, we were introduced to a new romance with Hulk and Widow. It's no Gwen and Peter or Pepper and Tony, but I liked the dynamic. Whedon definitely made us care more about each character this time around, as even Hawkeye became a bada**.As a safe house, we were taken to Hawkeye's real home. It was a nice break from the action to spend time with real people without any powers. Hawkeye was just overall a much better character here. After Vision awakens with the mind gem, we head to the final battle. I was glad that this time they were able to find a way to get people to safety, with help from Nick Fury, what an entrance by the way. With so many characters using everyone else's weapons in the battle, it made for one huge geek fest. But it goes to show you how much credit Whedon deserves for balancing all the screen time. Infinity War will be an even bigger challenge, good luck Russo bros. Speaking of that, Thanos' brief but menacing mid credits scene was cool and is a huge tease. I can't wait to see how everything unfolds now that we also have a New Avengers team, led by Cap. Sure Quiksilver wont be around but Vision was really cool and Scarlet Witch was electric so I'm really looking forward to it. Plus who doesn't love a little more Anthony Mackie as well? So there are definitely flaws to be talked about. Thor's detour midway through felt off, Ultron's humor is also out of place at times, and I can see where the action can be exhausting to some, and the amount of characters and cameos make it feel a little messy, but I just had so much fun at the movies. There are also times where things happen that feel like they should have a scene before, explaining it. I hope Joss Whedon puts out his extended 3hr long cut on the bluray. The film also feels at times that it sacrifices brains for action. But there's so much geek material here I don't think I can get too mad. I mean come on, who doesn't love that Hulkbuster fight!? I don't know how long superhero films will be around, so let's enjoy them while we can. What's next? Civil War is next, and I think you can already sense the tension between Cap and Tony. Sure, they end on good terms here, but they never really see eye to eye. Knowing how many are coming back (and possibly Spidey) gets me even more excited. It definitely seems like Avengers 2.5. Nevertheless, go experience this film in theaters.+Hawkeye is cool again +The main theme is back! +New characters turned out great +Hilarious gags +Ultron can be terrifying +New Avengers+Insane action -Some detours feel off -Ultron's humor was too out of place at times Critic score 9.5/10. Nerd score 10/10."", ""It hurts to rate this so poorly, but it certainly deserves the low marks. There were so many things that ruined this movie for me.1) The Storytelling - Or lack thereof. There was not a compelling story to be told here. Ultron wants to blow up the world, the Avengers try to stop him. That's all the audience ever really knows about this story and it felt flat and unfulfilling.2) Plot? - The movie opens with our heroes in the middle of a battle for reasons that are largely unimportant. That pretty much sums up this whole film3) The Love Interest - Totally underdeveloped. We're basically told by the script writer that these two people are in love, but never are we SHOWN that they're falling in love. It rang completely hollow.4) The Humor - There were WAY too many jokes in this movie, and that wouldn't have been all that bad if so many of them weren't eye rollers. Many of them left me groaning.5) Ultron - This guy appears out of nowhere and is woefully underdeveloped. Plus, he's supposed to be some kind of AI but he's constantly cracking off stupid one-liners and making facial expressions that I thought were inconsistent with what and who he was supposed to be.6) Character Overload - There were WAY too many characters to do any of them any justice. I would have liked the film to focus on a smaller group of characters and their relationships with one another, instead, we got a who's who of the entire Marvel universe leaving a lot to be desired.I could go on, but my heart is still aching and I don't want to talk about it anymore. I see that a lot of people liked it and I'm happy that they did. I only wish it hadn't been such a colossal disappointment for me."", ""Age of Ultron is a tiresome flick. The characters are the same as expected but Iron Man has become more snobbish and self centered. The character has gone over the top with his abilities to the point where the writers of the script give him carte blanche which makes Tony Stark in to an annoying 4 yr old.The Hulk is better CG, which is a good thing, but now he isn't the same Bruce Banner who has uncontrolled rage and then forgets every thing he did while as The Hulk. The writers have had to change his character because, uncontrolled, he becomes a loose canon. You can't give him any real dialog. Which ruins the character for me because I grew up with him being this blind rage of power going off to smash puny bad guys while saving good people who are scared of him.Marvel has become this lack luster pile of poop which is pushing out crappy movie after crappy movie to cash in on the popularity of comic book characters. This has caused movies like Age of Ultron to stink.There are some serious plot holes in the script but I'm not going to dwell on it. With out them the movie is still sub-par. The supporting cast is pushed through the movie like a scrap meat being put through a grinder.Captain America is flat. Barton is a worthless character. Black Widow is only eye candy. Thor is Thor, I honestly don't think they could screw him up. Nick Fury is... terrible. This Vision is too limited. The creators of these movies keep trying to cram too much in to the story when it took dozens of issues to build up just one character. Too much is lost on The Vision and his backstory by shoving him in to the final ten minutes of the movie as a escape for the writers.I watched Age of Ultron on Amazon and it took less than five minutes of the movie to make me want to start fast forwarding. I'm glad I didn't pay top dollar to see this in the theater. It wouldn't have been worth the money."", ""In the first AVENGERS, the villain was Thor's personal albatross, and now Tony Stark's invention is out to save the world by destroying it, or something like that\x85 And while it took over half the original movie for the eclectic group to warm up to each other, now we begin with so much bantering camaraderie it's like hanging out with the popular kids after prom\x85 And there are about five jokes per minute, as if Robert Downey Jr's quick-witted sarcasm was infected onto everyone else – even Ultron, Tony's dominating Artificial Intelligence Robot, who's full of wry wisdom: His nefarious motivation to do very bad things but unlike Loki, with an entire THOR film to catapult his dastardly menace, the titular heavy's purpose is completely forced and thoroughly confusing.

A lazy, soulless sequel, that shames its prequel & also the prolific superheroes.

The visuals are marvelous & the action-sequences are expertly choreographed. But, the narrative is stilted & soulless. Also, the pace is dreadfully slow in the first-hour. I was throughly bored in this hour, almost in disbelief if this one is actually a marvel movie.Joss Whedon's Screenplay is a downer. He made a terrific film previously, but this time around, he has faltered. The Writing Material surrenders to graphics & makes very less use of its own strength. Whedon's Direction, on the other-hand, is fair. Cinematography is alright. Editing is loose, the film runs for a long 142-minutes! The Avengers, however, do well. Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man, donning the part for the fifth time, hasn't lost his charm. Chris Hemsworth as Thor, is excellent here, while Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk, looks tired. Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America, has his moments. Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow, is passable. Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton / Hawkeye, is a pleasant surprise here. He actually gets scope to perform this time & he does. Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Quicksilver & Elizabeth Olsen as Scarlet Witch, add freshness in the proceedings. James Spader as Ultron, is the biggest letdown.

Rogers captures Strucker, while Stark retrieves the sceptre after Wanda implants a fear-filled vision of a bleak possible future in his mind.Back at the team\'s headquarters - Avengers Tower (formerly Stark Tower) - Stark and Banner discover an artificial intelligence within the sceptre\'s gem, and secretly plan to use it to complete Stark\'s ""Ultron"" global defence program. After many failed attempts, they leave for a victory party to celebrate the recapture of the sceptre. Unbeknownst to them, the program comes to life...The unexpectedly sentient Ultron (James Spader) awakens, believing that he must eradicate humanity to save the Earth, and overwhelms Stark\'s AI, JARVIS (Paul Bettany). In the guise of one of Stark\'s Iron Legion robot drones, Ultron attacks the Avengers as they relax together after their party. Escaping with the sceptre, Ultron uses the resources in Strucker\'s Sokovia base to upgrade his rudimentary body and build an army of robot drones. After killing Strucker, he then meets and recruits the Maximoff twins, who hold Stark responsible for their parents\' deaths due to weapons manufactured by his company.The trio goes to the base of arms dealer Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) in an African shipyard to obtain Wakandan vibranium. The Avengers pursue them there, but Wanda subdues all of them except Stark and Barton with haunting visions, causing Banner as the Hulk to rampage through a nearby city until Stark stops him with his Hulk-buster armour. A worldwide backlash over the resulting destruction and the fears incited by Wanda\'s hallucinations send the team into hiding at Barton\'s safehouse, where they meet his wife and children, who had been kept a secret from all of them except Romanoff.Seeing no answers to be found there, Thor departs to consult with his friend Dr Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard) on the meaning of the apocalyptic future he saw in his hallucination, while Romanoff and Banner discuss the possibility of fleeing together after realising their mutual attraction. However, Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) arrives and encourages the team to fight back and stop Ultron.In Seoul, Ultron forces the Avengers\' friend and ally Dr. Helen Cho (Claudia Kim) to use her synthetic-tissue technology, together with vibranium and the sceptre\'s gem, to perfect a new body for him. As Ultron uploads himself into the synthetic body, Wanda is then able to read his mind, and discovers his plan to annihilate humanity. Horrified, the Maximoffs turn on Ultron and join forces with Rogers to distract him while Romanoff and Barton retrieve the synthetic body. However, Ultron captures Romanoff while Barton reluctantly takes the body back to Stark and Banner at Avengers Tower, followed by Rogers and the twins.The Avengers fight amongst themselves when Stark secretly uploads JARVIS - who is still operational after hiding from Ultron deep within the Internet - into the synthetic body. Thor returns to help activate the body, explaining that the gem on its brow - one of the six Infinity Stones, the most powerful objects in existence - was part of his vision.This ""Vision"" (Paul Bettany) - proving himself a worthy ally by effortlessly lifting Thor\'s hammer Mjolnir - and the Maximoff twins accompany the Avengers back to Sokovia, where Ultron has used the remaining vibranium to build a machine to lift a large part of the capital city skyward, intending to crash it into the ground and cause global extinction. Banner rescues Romanoff, who pushes him into a pit to rouse the Hulk for the battle.The Avengers face off against Ultron\'s army of drones, while Fury arrives in a Helicarrier with Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders), James Rhodes / War Machine (Don Cheadle) and other SHIELD agents to evacuate the civilians. While the other Avengers go to help with the evacuation, Wanda accepts the task to guard the machine from activation by Ultron\'s drones. However Ultron steals the Avengers\' Quinjet and goes on a strafing run in a desperate attempt to stop the evacuation.Pietro is killed when he shields Barton from Ultron\'s gunfire. The Hulk leaps into the Quinjet and forcibly evicts Ultron - leaving him vulnerable to a vengeful Wanda, who abandons her post to destroy Ultron\'s primary body. This then allows one of his drones to activate the machine. The city begins to plummet, but Stark and Thor overload the machine and destroy the landmass, with the Vision swooping in to rescue Wanda. The Hulk, unwilling to endanger Romanoff by being with her, departs in the Quinjet, while the Vision confronts and destroys Ultron\'s last remaining body.Later, the Avengers have established a new base run by Fury, Hill, Cho, and Selvig.

38,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Ant-Man,478970,"[""Having enjoyed a vast majority of Marvel's superhero output (more so than most) without worshipping them, 'Ant-Man' is a minor effort from them but there is still a good amount to like about it.'Ant-Man' manages to be a better film than expected. The character is not exactly a household name and is always tossed aside in favour of other superhero characters like Spiderman that have had longer longevity and perhaps have more compelling origins and stories, hence why they are adapted more. Also wasn't sure what to make of the trailer, which made the film out to be rather bland and too reliant on humour.Seeing it for myself finally a year on, 'Ant-Man' could have been better. While the humour mostly works wonders, there are a few instances where it's not so funny and not very well placed, like in emotional scenes that are actually quite poignant and then interrupted by a joke that is not only forced and unfunny but also not belonging in the scene. The family scenes are a mixed bag, sometimes they are sweet and touching while at other times they're a little flat and predictable, contributing towards a few rare dull stretches. Corey Stoll also goes through the motions as the rather generic and under-characterised villain.On the other hand, 'Ant-Man' is a great looking film, it's beautifully shot, very atmospheric, is very slick and the special effects, mostly the rapid size-changing and with the ants, are clever and of the usual high-quality Marvel standards. The music avoids being over-bearing, one-note, too quirky or too bombastic, fitting well tone, mood and pace-wise. Direction is more than competent, keeping the story going at a solid pace and the telling of it interesting enough, though maybe a little more flavour may have been more welcome. While the action is not as much as most Marvel films, it is fun, thrilling, nicely choreographed and tautly shot and edited, especially towards the end. Admittedly there are a couple of cheesy parts towards the end too, but kind of in an endearing rather than jarring way and it doesn't jar with the rest of the film.There is some very smart and hugely entertaining scripting and dialogue here in 'Ant-Man' too. While it doesn't work completely seamlessly, 'Ant-Man' is one of Marvel's generally consistently funniest films, and the film doesn't take itself too seriously or too much of a joke either, instead not being afraid to embrace the silliness and humour while ensuring still that the subject matter is treated with respect. It is especially good with the title character's deadpan quips and Luis' fast-talking patter. The story is mostly diverting, it's narratively simpler than most Marvel outings and less risks here are taken than most Marvel films but it always makes sense, moments of dullness and jarring are few (while not being completely absent either), it's fun and it doesn't try to do too much or try to insert too many characters while not playing things too safe either.While not complex as such, the characters are mostly engaging and are not too one-dimensional, only the villain could have had more done with him. Paul Rudd is a strong and hugely entertaining lead, while Michael Peña's hilarious in a role that could have been really annoying. The seasoned support of Michael Douglas adds hugely too, and Evangeline Lilly gives the film some much needed heart. Anthony Mackie is good too.Overall, minor Marvel but good Marvel. Well-made and a lot of fun, but there is a personal preference to the Marvel films that took bigger risks with more and often richer characters, bigger bolder action and more going on in the story. 'Ant-Man' executes a vast majority of its components really well indeed, just that Marvel has done even better before and since. 7/10 Bethany Cox"", ""ANT-MAN is another light and breezy Marvel superhero movie conceived as a stand-alone introductory piece. The story is about a down-on-his-luck thief who ends up stealing a body suit that has the power to miniaturise him instantly. He then uses said suit to go on a heist to retrieve some important technology from a maniac. The film is set in the same universe as the Avengers films and contains some clumsily shoehorned-in references to the franchise.It's a simple enough conceit, but one which zings with humour and features endlessly great CGI action sequences which really push the boundaries and show off techniques and effects that haven't been done before. It was a lot of fun seeing ants playing the good guys in a similar way to HONEY, I SHRUNK THE KIDS. The heist plot is nothing special but there's enough ensemble acting and humour to see it through. I wasn't particularly interested in Paul Rudd's hero, but Michael Douglas gives reliable support and Corey Stoll's bad guy is memorably nasty. For a light-hearted effects blockbuster, ANT-MAN works a treat."", ""Ant-Man (2015)*** 1/2 (out of 4)Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is released from prison and plans on going straight but that doesn't go as planned but he's recruited by Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) to try out a suit that manages to shrink his size while making him even stronger. Soon Ant-Man has to try and stop a bad guy (Corey Stoll) trying to sell the secret.ANT-MAN is a film that really took me by surprise. I'm not a comic book person so I wasn't familiar with this character or the story. I was really shocked at how entertaining the personal drama was as well as how exciting the action was. When I first saw the trailer I couldn't help but think of HONEY, I SHRUNK THE KIDS and this film actually benefits from the same thing that movie did and that's the rather cool effect of being small and surrounded by large, everyday items.This is certainly one aspect that makes the film so entertaining because the entire idea of someone being able to shrink and then go back to their regular size in the matter of seconds is just fun. Even more fun is the way he is trained into becoming this warrior because it not only adds some great action scenes but also some very good laughs. You've got the action and the laughs but I thought the film also sold the personal drama that the main characters have.A lot of credit has to go to the cast for pulling this off. Rudd is as perfect as Ant-Man as Robert Downey, Jr. is as Iron Man. The casting was simply perfect because Rudd can perfectly handle the drama, the comedy and the action and he makes for a complete character. Douglas also adds a lot to the film in his supporting role as does Stoll as the villain. Michael Pena and Bobby Cannnavale are both good in their supporting bits as is Evangeline Lilly in her role.ANT-MAN also benefits from clocking in under two hours as the film never seems too long. The story isn't dragged on and instead we're given non-stop action and fun. There have been many good movies made from Marvel comics but ANT-MAN is certainly among the best."", ""In 1989, Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and Howard Stark clash over Pym's invention, the Pym particle. In the present, Hank Pym is no longer in charge of his own company. His protégé Darren Cross (Corey Stoll) has revived his research against his wishes and creates the Yellowjacket, a shrinking suit. With his daughter Hope (Evangeline Lilly) on the inside, Hank tries to stop Darren. Meanwhile, thief Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) gets out of San Quentin after three years. He's desperate to be good for his daughter but can't hold onto any legal work. His crime partner Luis (Michael Peña) gets him a job to break into a safe. He's surprised to find only a strange outfit in the safe. Pym sees him as the perfect candidate for Ant-Man.This is a great refreshing smaller size superhero movie. The world isn't ending and yet the stakes feel big. Michael Peña is funny. Paul Rudd is great. His relationship with his daughter is lovely. I love Michael Douglas. It would be amazing if he continues in the universe. The shrinking is terrific. The humor is good although I find one moment awkward. Hank is having a tough conversation with Hope about her mother and Scott puts a comedic button on the scene. In general, this superhero movie has plenty of heart, fun and adventure."", ""Once again, there's a guy who needs to take over the world and side with a horrible group. He has money and fame and yet he has to go over to the dark side. In this case, he has taken previous research and molded it to his own devices. Michael Douglas first developed the ability to close up molecules and make things turn smaller with intense strength and capabilities. Then he loses his wife and drops from the scene. His right hand man, an ambitious jerk moves ahead and plots evil use of the findings. Paul Rudd plays a poor guy who is divorced. He was sent to prison for a burglary which had some unfair circumstances that led to unfair results. Pyn, Michael Douglas's character, realizes that he has to stop the next step or these bad guys will take over the world and brutalize it. Rudd becomes Ant-Man, not just because he can become small, but because he learns to run with the ants. Of course, the whole thing is high on the hokeyness meter, but, then, it is comic book stuff. It is fun and exciting and works pretty well. It leads to some pretty sappy results, but this is not Fellini or Bergman. It's a joyful effort, using the Marvel trademark."", ""I guess a lot of people thought (me included) that this could be the one Marvel Film that could flop at the box office. Not helped by the late change in director as Edgar Wright walked out after developing the project for years. The marketing of the film also seemed unfocused.The opening part of the film did not hold out much hope. Paul Rudd plays Scott Lang, a down on his luck ex-con. He has recently got out of jail, cannot hold a decent job because of his criminal record. His ex-wife is about to marry a cop and he has trouble getting access to his daughter because he cannot pay child support.His friends persuade to him to take part in a heist and this is when we find out that Lang is just a little more than a cat burglar but someone rather smart, resourceful and cunning. However his efforts in trying to break into an impregnable safe rewards him with just a funny kind of costume. A costume which he discovers has special powers that shrinks him. Lang is arrested when he tries to give the costume back.Lang is contacted in jail by scientist Hank Pym (Michael Douglas.) In an opening flashback we see that he worked for Shield. Now he has been forced out of his company by his own protégé Darren Cross (Corey Stoll) and estranged daughter Hope (Evangeline Lilly.) Pym has mastered the technology in developing a suit that shrinks but also has a device that controls ants. He did not want the project to fall into wrong hands. Cross has been developing his own similar project unsuccessfully. His Yellowjacket so far fails to shrink and we soon find out that he will stop at nothing.Pym thinks it is only a matter of time before Cross will succeed and Lang is persuaded to develop his skills with Pym as mentor. Hope who has realised that Cross has gone too far is his trainer. Together with an army of intelligent ants, Lang learns how to shrink and de-shrink in an instance as well as learn how to do combat.Lang teams up with his band of ex-cons to break into Cross's firm and destroy the suit assisted by Hope still in the inside.There is nothing original about Ant Man in the Marvel film universe, well apart from that he shrinks in size and never gets stepped on. It is the usual case of an ordinary guy, who has got the wrong end of the stick in life, develops superpowers via a suit, learns how to use it and goes after the bad guys. This is the initial part of the set up and the film takes it time getting there. It only really finds the right gear in the second half of the film.There is very little else in the plot that will shake you. Hank's protégé is bald so just think Jeff Bridges in Iron Man. Cross immediately is shown to be evil so no surprises there.This leaves with Rudd giving enough of a quirky performance which is mainly the reason why he was cast. He is just right being the every man loser, wanting to do the right thing. He is charming, funny in an understated way and likable, less of a grunt compared to other Marvel Film characters. Of course he needs to be quirky and off beat when the concept is a man that shrinks to an ant.When you see some of the action sequences, especially at the climax, I think it is clear that Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish's script elements have been maintained with a big influence from, dare I say Wallace & Gromit. Just look at that scene involving Thomas the Tank Engine.Paul Rudd is ably assisted by Michael Pena and his gang of misfit ex-cons. Douglas is solid as Hank, suspicious of Shield, Cross and ghosts from the past.Although it does not at times feel like a Marvel film their are enough references to Shield and Avengers as well as an Avengers sidekick flying in.It looks like Marvel were right to have faith in Ant-Man as he was punched above his size at the box office."", 'In 1989, the scientist Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) quits working for the S.H.I.E.L.D. when he discovers that they have unsuccessfully tried to replicate his shrinking technology named Ant-Man that he considers too dangerous for mankind. In the present days, Dr. Pym was forced by his daughter Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) and his former protégé Darren Cross (Corey Stoll) to leave his company Pym Technologies to them. Further, he finds that Darren is developing his own shrinking technology named Yellowjacket.Meanwhile, the small-time burglar Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is released from prison and welcomed by his former cell mate Luis (Michael Peña) that wants him to participate in a heist.

Soon he learns that he is part of the scheme plotted by Dr. Pym and Hope to make him a superhero wearing the suit and save the world destroying the Yellowjacket. Without any alternative, Scott is trained by Dr. Pym and Hope in the beginning of an incredible adventure. ""Ant-Man"" is a highly entertaining adventure with another Marvel (unknown) hero. The plot is very funny and it is funnier to read reviews showing plot holes based on science and forgetting that the story is based on a comic magazine. The special effects are also great and it is good to see Evangeline Lilly again. There are two scenes entwined in the credits, the last one in the very end. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Homem-Formiga"" (""Ant-Man"")', 'In many ways this is an odd addition to the Marvel universe. As the films seem to get bigger and bigger with each one, Ant-Man is surprisingly small (as the title suggests). It is not just the character, but also the plotting – it is not really a world-beating foe here, but just a simple robbery (albeit for an unique item). In doing so, the film gets to do what so many of the other films do (have fun at its own silliness), but it benefits by not having to deliver a massive universal conclusion too.In some ways the film plays to this well, and it has some very funny moments along with a general sense of fun; however at the same time it always feels like it is not quite firing on all cylinders either. Of course Edgar Wright famously left the film in the middle, and one does have to wonder how much more spark he would have brought to the final film if he had been allowed to. There is still a lot to enjoy about its silliness (the final fight on the train, and Thomas the Tank Engine himself being a great example), but too much of it seems ordinary, albeit with the extraordinary narrative device. It is expensively produced, and has some clever sequences, but the most fun moments do tend to highlight that not enough of the film is up there.The cast work hard and mostly do well. Rudd is fun, although when in shrunken action mode, his key appeal is less evident as he is an effect not a character. Peña is not the second name on the cast list by a mile, however he is one of the best bits of casting, and his comedic delivery produces some of the most fun moments (the story- telling montages). Douglas, Lilly, Stoll, Cannavale, Harris, Donovan, and others are all solid, but nobody really goes out of their way to make it their best work or even close. In the end Ant- Man is a fun blockbuster, even if it is not as consistent, nor as fun, as it should have been.', 'Ant-Man introduces Paul Rudd as our new Avenger. Scott Lang (Rudd) is a thief/ hacker who spent time in jail. He wants nothing more than to go straight and establish a life with visitation rights for his daughter (Abby Ryder Fortson). His wife (Judy Greer) is about to move on with a policeman (Bobby Cannavale).In a subplot Dr. Hank Pym is played by Michael Douglas who comes on the scene, almost doing an aside, and says ""I\'m still alive."" He was part of a company that shrinks the space between atoms. It is now run by Darren Cross (Corey Stoll) with the assistance of his own daughter (Evangeline Lilly).The two subplots come together with formula results, it was like watching the first ""Iron Man"" again which isn\'t too bad, just predictable. The script is filled with humorous moments and a few memorable lines. It leads us into an Avengers sequel which isn\'t bad for Paul Rudd fans.Guide: No sex or nudity. Minor swearing. No F-bombs.', 'How can you do a really good movie about a man who transforms into a little man? How do you make it accessible to people who are not aware of the comic world, but also keep it real with the fans of the Marvel Universe? Well Marvel seems to have all the right answers to that. Generally speaking that is, because as always, there will be people who might not like this at all.But the acting in this, is superb! Getting Michael Douglas and Paul Rudd in the two main roles is genius. Also Evangeline Lilly, who is not Lost anymore. The comedy timing, the story telling, the little things that make this movie work, are all elevating it to an experience you can have, that is a fun ride. Something movies should be, if they are aiming for it.Because this is not meant to solve world problems, this is not meant to be a heavy drama, this is meant to be what it is. And by those ""rules"", it expands the Marvel Universe ... can\'t wait to see what\'s coming up next (Phase 3 has started)', 'For a second, maybe even a third tier Marvel Comic character, ""Ant-Man"" turned out to be a fun movie with a nice blend of action, suspense and humor. I got a kick out of the scientific jargon Dr. Henry Pym (Michael Douglas) used to describe his shrinking technology, a particle that could change the distance between atoms while increasing density and strength. In a tribute to the comic book origin of Ant-Man, Darren Cross (Corey Stoll) describes the shrinking process as a \'tale to astonish\', a reference to \'Tales to Astonish #27\' from January, 1962 in which the character made his first appearance. And as usual, Marvel writer, creator and editor Stan Lee cameos near the very end of the movie as a bartender, describing what might have been one\'s reaction to the picture - ""Yeah, crazy-stupid fine""! is the way he states it. I can go with that.There\'s also the cool way the writers tied in the rest of the Marvel universe by referencing The Avengers (see my summary quote), and that scene with Ant-Man battling the Falcon (Anthony Mackie) on top of Avengers headquarters. All of this is played with just the right sort of tongue in cheek humor while miniaturizing Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) in the Ant-Man suit and having him sabotage Cross\'s plan to sell his updated technology to the goons from Hydra. The only time I thought the film makers took it too far was having Ant-Man go sub-atomic and make it back again after Hank Pym\'s dire warning. That concept probably could have been saved for a sequel, although that idea was telegraphed pretty well.Quite coincidentally as I watched this movie for the second time, I happened to be reading a novel by Michael Crichton entitled \'Micro\' which borrows liberally from the Ant-Man concept. It tells the story of an evil scientific genius who shrinks some prospective new employees after they learn he might have had one of his vice presidents killed, brother to one of the students. The story deals with half inch humans in a novel way, placing their adventure in Hawaii and examining how they deal with threats from nature at ground level. It\'s a quick read and makes you think about life from a different perspective.Anyway, like a lot of viewers, I think my surprise at how good this film turned out to be makes me look forward to what comes next. A couple of after film scenes hinted at not one, but two potential sequels. When Dr. Pym shows his daughter Hope (Evangeline Lilly) the prototype suit he was working on with his deceased wife, it\'s suggested that the follow up movie further explores the sub-atomic world with an Ant-Woman. Then, an eventual Ant-Man team-up with the Avengers is suggested by the Falcon\'s cryptic words to Cap when he says ""I know a guy"".', ""Armed with a super-suit with the astonishing ability to shrink in scale but increase in strength, cat burglar Scott Lang must embrace his inner hero and help his mentor, Dr. Hank Pym, plan and pull off a heist that will save the world.I might be in the minority, but I think this is the best film in the Marvel universe yet, or at least in a long time. As the films got bigger, they became more crowded, more full of action, and more full of computer-generated fluff. This film returns to a script, with a solid set of characters. There is still action (because it's a superhero film), but it does not overwhelm the picture.Also, Paul Rudd makes for a great hero. What Marvel has done well is casting actors who add a light and humorous element, even during universe-altering stories. Rudd, Chris Pratt and Robert Downey... these guys are enjoyable and make for heroes we really like to see."", 'Marvel Comics created many great superheroes that have graced the screen and become especially big in the 21st Century, but the title character of this next incarnation was not a household name, but this movie certainly looked worth a go, directed by Peyton Reed (Bring It On, Down with Love, The Break-Up, Yes Man). Basically well-meaning thief Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) has been released from prison, he moves in with his old cellmate Luis (Crash\'s Michael Peña), he is determined to go straight and get a job to provide child support, this is the only way his ex-wife Maggie (Jurassic World\'s Judy Greer), now engaged to policeman Paxton (Blue Jasmine\'s Bobby Cannavale), will allow him to see his daughter Cassie (Abby Ryder Fortson). Unable to hold a job because of his criminal record, Scott agrees to join Luis and his crew to commit a burglary, he breaks in past security systems and cracks the safe, but he finds only what looks like an old motorcycle suit, but he does take this home. Scott tries on the suit at home, and accidentally presses a switch that causes him to shrink to the size of an insect, Ant-Man, he survives a flush down the drain and onto the streets before returning to normal size, terrified by the experience he returns the suit to the house, but he ends up arrested. Former S.H.I.E.L.D. scientist Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), the homeowner, visits the jail and smuggles the Ant-Man shrinking suit into Scott\'s cell to help him break out, at his home Pym explains that he resigned from S.H.I.E.L.D. after discovering that they attempted to replicate the suit shrinking technology, Pym\'s former protégé Darren Cross (Non-Stop\'s Corey Stoll) is close to perfecting a shrinking suit of his own, the Yellowjacket. Pym manipulated Scott through Luis into stealing the suit, it was a test, he wants him to become the new Ant-Man to steal the Yellowjacket, Pym\'s estranged daughter Hope van Dyne (Lost\'s Evangeline Lilly) has been spying on Cross despite her strained relationship with her father, she helps train Scott to use the technology of the suit, to fight and to control ants. Scott is first sent to steal a device from the Avengers\' headquarters, where he briefly fights Sam Wilson / Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Hope shows anger towards Pym about the death of her mother Janet (Hayley Lovitt), he explains that she was The Wasp and disappeared, whilst disabling a Soviet nuclear missile, into a subatomic quantum realm, he warns Scott this could happen if he overrides the suit\'s safeguards. The Yellowjacket is perfected and Pym is invited to the unveiling, Scott meanwhile, with the swarm of ants, flyers, builders and others, infiltrates the building, sabotages the servers and plants explosives, but Cross traps him, he intends to sell both the Yellowjacket and Ant-Man suits to Hydra, led by Mitchell Carson (Martin Donovan), Scott manages to escape, Carson flees, and Scott pursues Cross, while the explosives detonate and the building is destroyed. Ant-Man and Yellowjacket fight until Scott is arrested by Paxton, but Cross holds Cassie hostage to lure him into another fight, but this time Scott shrinks to subatomic size to penetrate Cross\'s suit and sabotage it to shrink uncontrollably, Cross is killed, Scott disappears into the quantum realm, but tampers with the safeguards and manages to reverse the mechanism and return to the real world. In the end Paxton covers for Scott in gratitude to keep him out of prison and allow him to be with his daughter, Pym wonders if his wife is also alive in the quantum realm, Luis tells Scott that Wilson is looking for him, and Pym shows and offers Hope a new prototype Wasp suit. Also starring Wood Harris as Gale, David Dastmalchian as Kurt, Tip ""T.I."" Harris as Dave, Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter, John Slattery as Howard Stark, Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America, Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes and Stan Lee as Bartender. Rudd manages to pass off being just-about serious and the leading hero, but leaves room for deadpan quips, Douglas is a good choice for the wise scientist, Lilly gets her time being the feisty scientist\'s daughter, and Stoll is good at being the nasty villain, the supporting cast members get their good moments too. You almost ignore the fact that you may not have heard of the title character before this film was made, you buy into it fairly quickly, and there\'s small references back to the Avengers, you can just settle back and enjoy the fantastic special effects that take you into the microscopic world of insects and create fast-paced chase and fight sequences, and there is funny stuff too, all together it is a fun action adventure. Good!', 'After three years in prison cat burglar Scott Lang finds it difficult to find work so soon gets involved in a robbery. His criminal contacts have learnt about an old man with a massive safe in his basement\x85 they don\'t know what it contains but given the security it must be valuable. He is rather surprised to discover that all it contains is what looks like an old biker-suit. He takes it and tries it on later\x85 suddenly he shrinks to the size of an ant! It turns out the suit\'s owner, Dr Hank Pym, intended for him to steal it he wants somebody who is a skilled burglar to use the suit for a very specific job. Initially Scott isn\'t interested but inevitably he is soon pulled in. Hank explains how the suit works and tells Scott that he is worried because his former protégé Darren Cross has replicated the technology and intends to sell it to the highest bidder. Scott won\'t be working alone; he will have support from Hank, his daughter Hope, his three criminal friends and lots of ants\x85 it turns out Dr Pym has developed technology that enables ants to be telepathically controlled! Ultimately Scott, in his Ant-Man suit will have to face Cross who is wearing his fully armed \'Yellowjacket\' suit.Not being a comic reader I wasn\'t familiar with Ant-Man before this film came out but when heard about it I thought the premise sounded rather fun\x85 and so it is. There are some humorous moments, mostly provided by Scott\'s criminal friends; these are fun and don\'t detract from the story. Scott/Ant-Man is a good protagonist as he isn\'t a typical superhero; he has no natural superpowers and the technology he uses wasn\'t invented by himself. Paul Rudd does a fine job in the role and is ably supported by Michael Douglas and Evangeline Lilly as Dr Pym and Hope. Corey Stoll is suitably menacing as Cross and Michael Peña, Tip ""T.I."" Harris and David Dastmalchian are fun as Scott\'s criminal friends. The special effects are very impressive making it easy to suspend ones disbelief and accept that Ant-Man can change size and interact with actual ants. I liked the fact that while it is made clear that this film takes place in the same reality as other Marvell superhero films it doesn\'t guest star any other well-known superheroes just one less well known one in a scene where Ant-Man infiltrates an Avengers facility to steal a needed piece of equipment. Overall I\'d certainly recommend this to fans of the superhero genre; it is lots of fun and has plenty of exciting moments.', 'Normally I am not overly keen or fond of superhero movies, but after having heard lots of good things about it and because Paul Rudd stars in it, then I decided to sit down and watch ""Ant-Man"".And I must say that I was more than genuinely surprised with how entertaining this movie turned out to be. It was good and wholesome entertainment from start to end.The story was good and easily comprehensible. And it was a nice twist with the cut-over into the Avengers universe, for those whom enjoy that type of superheroes.What appealed to me in ""Ant-Man"" was the comedy and the offbeat character and unlikely superhero character. That and also the performance by Paul Rudd in this movie, because he really carried the movie quite well. It was also nice to see Michael Douglas back on the screen, as it had been some time since last I saw him. But also Corey Stoll was really well cast for the villainous role.""Ant-Man"" has lots of action, subtle comedy, good special effects and good acting performances.All in all, then I am rating ""Ant-Man"" a solid seven out of ten stars.', ""After a three year stretch in San Quentin, brilliant cat-burglar Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) attempts to go straight, but when he is fired from his job at Baskin Robbins, his criminal pals talk him into a potentially lucrative safe-cracking job that leads to the discovery of a special high-tech suit capable of shrinking a man to the size of an ant while increasing his speed and strength\x85I grew up reading DC Comics rather than Marvel, but the DC cinematic universe has disappointed me far more than it has impressed: in particular, I found the Nolan Batman films and Snyder's Superman movie overtly serious in tone, visually dreary and consequently rather dull. In contrast, the majority of Marvel's superhero films have been colourful, exciting, and, most importantly, a lot of fun. Despite a troubled production, Ant-man also manages to be all of these things.It might seem like a minor movie in the MCU when compared to the X-Men and Avengers films, which are far broader in scope, but Ant-man succeeds in delivering the requisite action and spectacle, as well as some much needed humour. The script, from Joe Cornish and Edgar Wright, is full of light-hearted moments that acknowledge the silliness of the whole concept, and director Peyton Reed keeps things moving along at a decent pace. The film also ties in nicely with the Avengers series with a neat scene in which Ant-man meets (and beats) Falcon (Anthony Mackie).7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for the incredible effects, best of all being the de-ageing of Michael Douglas."", ""'Ant-Man' is part of the Marvel Universe of action fiction, and in fact Stan Lee has his customary cameo in it. We viewed it on BluRay and the picture and sound are first-rate. The concept is a scientist (Michael Douglas) has developed a technique to shrink the size between atoms some 25 years earlier but shelves it, and in fact denies it, because his protégé has evil intentions for it, making the world a more dangerous place. But petty criminal, just out of jail and locked out of his young daughter's life, Paul Rudd as Scott Lang, gets a chance to climb out of his hole by helping implement a strategy to defeat the evil scientist. To do this he has to put on and learn to use a suit which can convert him, at the press of a button, into Ant-Man, literally the size of an ant but retaining all his power. So in that tiny package his power is more like a super power.Evangeline Lilly has a key role as Hope van Dyne, Corey Stoll is good as the evil scientist Darren Cross, and when dressed in his own suit, Yellowjacket.There are characters from other Marvel stories, like Anthony Mackie who is in such series as The Avengers and Captain America, plus Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter of 'Agent Carter.'The story is good and often humorous, Rudd is really good in his role, and the movie overall is very entertaining."", 'Ant-Man delivers much of the fun, good (if silly) stretches of the comedy, and the wacky comic-book science fiction stuff that many of us come to expect from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It\'s also a movie that caused some movie people to raise their eyebrows when the original director Edgar Wright parted ways with Marvel over some ""creative differences"". What was it exactly, we may never know, though there\'s been speculation about the studio and producers like Kevin Feige forcing on the other aspects of the MCU onto what is an origin story mostly unto itself about Dr. Hank Pym restarting his Ant-Man design with thief Scott Lang (Michael Douglas and Paul Rudd, both cast by Wright). Whatever the case, we now have the movie we have in front of us. For me, I saw little things that did indicate it was still Wright\'s work (and he shares script and story credit with Joe Cornish, along with Rudd and Adam McKay), while still being basically a fairly safe comic-book movie.What I mean by comic-book movie isn\'t meant to be a put-down, though with the deluge we\'ve been getting in theaters (or it feels like that due to the over-marketing of them) there\'s always the possibility of fatigue from all of the explosions and daring-do. At the heart of Ant-Man is lots of goofy science that is explained in the way that it is through these kinds of movies, not just of the Marvel kind but just of any goofy sci-fi flick (atoms, and things becoming Sub-Atomic as well, which I\'ll get to later). At the same time it\'s also a father-daughter story, as both Pym and Lang are fathers who have to do right by them - it\'s what drives them both, and the scenes between Douglas and Evangeline Lilly feel strong enough in that regard (her mother, Hank\'s wife and the original Wasp we learn, died due to an accident in the 80\'s).We only see so much of Rudd and his daughter, and for me that was kind of perfunctory for the story: his drive to do right by his daughter is mentioned repeatedly, not least of which by his ex-wife and the girl\'s new father (Bobby Cannavale, always a welcome presence), but we only see so much of that bond between them, given that Lang\'s just gotten out of jail. But it\'s fine - the desire to see her will, I guess, drive him to have better control over his ant army (no kidding) to get into places and ""steal stuff"" as the trailer says. And for what he\'s asked for, Rudd makes this a fun, likable anti-turned-real hero, and delivers the quips and one-liners given with the comic umph that they\'re needed.The action moves swiftly enough and is directed competently. I mention \'competently\' not to make Peyton Reed seem like some kind of hired hack - hired, though he was, he shows some visual flair, most notably when a character finally becomes ""Sub-Atomic"", which is as much a credit to the VFX wizards at Marvel studios, but is probably the highlight of the movie for me, when things story-wise get most desperate too - but is it missing its original director? This could be a good example to show in film schools down the line of how a script can have solid comic beats and unexpected moments for characters (primarily the wildest and funniest lines are given to Lang\'s co-horts in crime, most especially Michael Pena), while still missing a real visual edge. Again, this isn\'t badly directed exactly, and I\'m sure things like the Thomas the Tank Engine gag, and not just what you see in the trailer but everything else, could have been screwed up in even more incapable hands.But maybe there could\'ve been more to the villain. Here we get Corey Stoll as Cross, a pretty terrific actor (Midnight in Paris, House of Cards especially) and here we know who this character is - Pym\'s former protégé gone corporate criminal mastermind - from minute one, without any ambiguity. But it didn\'t make him very interesting, and I felt kind of sorry for such a guy as good as he is to be given a character who is at best two dimension if not less (""I saw too much of me in you,"" Hank basically says to Cross to explain to the audience why he is the way he is, the bad parts magnified). There\'s also some science with the character and the Yellow-Jacket suit that get rushed in the third act, but really it is another example of a Marvel villain getting the short-shrift; maybe not to the extent of Ronen in \'Guardians\', but close enough.Still, the heroic side is what is most often strong in these MCU movies, and Rudd and Lilly deliver for the characters solid acting chops, and you care (up to a point at least) about the conflicts. Douglas does too, and maybe gives the most... most character, I guess (interesting, captivating, troubled, you pick). Pym has so much that has happened in his life, much heart-break, lost scientific dreams either stolen away from him or, worse, it went to his head. It makes me want to see an Ant-Man pre-origin movie, albeit with another actor (and no more weird CGI to make actors look younger, like in the opening scene of this - weird).He\'s the kind of star a film like this needs alongside the other capable and ready-to-do-this players, and makes Ant-Man a fun experience with its complex heist involving (yes) a fleet of ants, and the ability of the hero to shrink and grow large with the push of a button. A cool power, which I hope to see more of in these movies. But top tier for this studio? Not quite.', ""Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend and his friend and that friend's girlfriend. They laughed throughout the movie but I just smiled at some of the scenes and lines. When it came to the climatic battle, however, I found myself laughing along with them especially during that toy train sequence. Paul Rudd is the appropriate hero as the title character who shrinks and goes back to normal in one quick beat. Michael Douglas is the mentor who previously was that costumed fighter but gave it up after suffering a tragedy. Evangeline Lilly is the daughter of Douglas' character who also wants in on the action. All I'll say now is I highly recommend Ant-Man."", 'This film tells the story of a criminal with a masters degree in electronic engineering who tries to take the right path for the sake of his daughter. Through strange twists of fate, he becomes an unlikely superhero called the Ant-Man.The many posters for ""Ant-Man"" only emphasises the diminutive size of the new superhero in the Marvel collection, but to me they do not entice me to watch the film. After watching ""Ant-Man"" though, I was completely blown away.""Ant-Man"" has a long build up because it is introducing an entirely new superhero. The build up is good, and characters all have distinctive personalities to make them different and interesting. I was captivated by the plot. It has so much action going on both action-wise and emotionally and I am still spell bound despite having left the cinema and arrived home. I really like the fact that there are two emotional subplots, one involving Paul Rudd and his daughter, and the other one between Michael Douglas and his daughter.Ant-Man is an unlikely superhero film, because ants are not usually adored by people. To turn it into a great superhero film is quite an achievement. I really enjoyed watching ""Ant-Man"".', ""Given the production problems and its long gestation period, Ant-Man is arguably far better than it had right to be. Unsurprisingly with a Marvel Super Hero film, the critical reactions have been mixed, but given it's not as gargantuan as most Marvel pics it proves to have a big entertaining heart. A pic cunningly viewing the Marvel Universe from a different angle, whilst also not over egging the pudding.The effects work is impressive, the origin story narrative engrossing and with it carrying a lightness of touch, and there's a very enjoyable cast enthusiastically buying into the comic book frivolity. Sure, some of it's just plain daft, our hero's powers are hardly blunderbuss stuff, while the family melodramas bubbling away feel tired, but come the glorious finale, pandering to the child in us all, it's another Marvel winner readying itself for further adventures of Ant-Man. 7.5/10"", 'One of Marvel\'s Lesser known, Second String, ""Smaller"" Characters.

In fact, because this was a Marvel character I watched it. I say that because Ant-Man was never that intriguing to me in the comics and it didn\'t sound anymore intriguing just because it was on film. But alas, Marvel usually does a good production so what\'s a couple of dollars and two hours on a weeknight? ""Ant-Man"" was able to make an otherwise ridiculous sounding superhero kinda cool. There was a little bit of back story offered to help the audience understand who created Ant-Man and what the potential conflict would be. Of course it always helps if you\'re a fan of the comic because then you\'re totally plugged in to the entire story.This wasn\'t one of Marvel\'s best in my opinion but I can see how and why they are expounding upon the movies they release. 1.) It offers more flavors for the general public and 2.) It sets up for a very awesome super movie which can potentially integrate all of these characters into the story (ala Civil War, House of M, or Secret Invasion for all of you Marvel comic nerds like me).', 'I\'ll admit I wasn\'t looking forward to this one. I was barely looking forward to it when Edgar Wright was attached, but after his very public break from the project I had zero expectations this would be anything but a trainwreck. I\'m happy to say that it wasn\'t as bad as I feared. It actually isn\'t bad at all. A little ""meh"" perhaps but not bad. I enjoyed it for what it is, even if it\'s probably one of the last Marvel movies I\'ll be in any hurry to rewatch anytime soon. Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly are fine but do little to impress. Corey Stoll is a generic villain, forgettable in every way. Michael Peña and T.I. do a good job in their comedy relief roles. Anthony Mackie is fun as Falcon in his brief appearance. The best part of the movie, somewhat surprisingly, is Michael Douglas. I had doubts he would approach the part seriously, as a lot of actors from his generation look at comic book movies as an excuse to be campy. But he doesn\'t approach it that way and shines throughout the movie, easily overshadowing everyone else. I thought the scene where he was de-aged with special effects was nicely done. The effects were pretty good overall. The major negatives for the movie are that it never feels like it amounts to much and there are no memorable set pieces. There are so many ways to approach the character of Ant-Man, humorously and dramatically, that would have been more effective but also more risky. They chose to play it safe and I suppose I can\'t fault them for that. As it is, it\'s an enjoyable lightweight action comedy.', 'The Marvel Comics Universe keeps getting bigger and more spectacular with each appearance of ""The Avengers,"" ""Iron Man,"" ""Captain America,"" ""Thor,"" ""The Fantastic Four,"" ""X-Men,"" ""Wolverine,"" and ""The Guardians of the Galaxy."" Consequently, it comes with a sigh of relief that the latest newcomer, ""Ant-Man"" (**** OUT OF ****), shrinks from such apocalyptic pretensions. ""Bring It On"" director Peyton Reed, who replaced British writer & director Edgar Wright, has helmed what could possibly be the most imaginative as well as the atypical superhero saga of the summer. Miniaturization is the cornerstone of this clever little yarn. Mind you, nobody can completely appreciate ""Ant-Man"" who hasn\'t seen director Jack Arnold\'s seminal science-fiction feature ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"" (1957) where an unfortunate fellow--through no fault of his own--found himself reduced to the size of a toothpick and tangled with predatory house cats while taking refuge in a child\'s doll house. Similarly, the next major movie to magnify shrinkage, director Richard Fleischer\'s ""Fantastic Voyage"" (1966), scaled down scientists to microscopic dimensions and injected them into a comatose scientist\'s bloodstream to save him from a lethal blood clot. Appropriately, television capitalized on all things minuscule with Irwin Allen\'s ""Land of the Giants"" (1968-1970) where the crew and passengers of the Spindrift, a commercial sub-orbital transport spaceship, traveled into treacherous outer space turbulence and then crashed on an unknown planet. Everything loomed twelve times larger on this peculiar planet than anything on Earth making for 51 exciting episodes. Of course, other honorable mentions include the Dennis Quaid comedy ""Innerspace"" (1987) and the Rick Moranis farce ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"" (1989).""Ant-Man"" opens in 1989. Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) hands Howard Stark (John Slattery of ""Iron Man 2"") his resignation and leaves the espionage, law-enforcement, and counterterrorism agency SHIELD. Naturally, Stark regrets Pym\'s departure. Pym exits because SHIELD went behind his back and endeavored to duplicate the Pym Particle with his Ant-Man shrinking-suit technology. Pym lost his wife while during his experiments with that technology, and he deems it is far too dangerous for anybody to trifle with. ""As long as I am alive,"" proclaims Pym, ""nobody is ever going to get that formula."" This early scene fascinates because the filmmakers have given actor Michael Douglas an incredible, computerized, makeover so he appears twenty years or younger. For the record, Hollywood has altered some of the Marvel Comics canon. In the comics, Pym—not Tony Stark and Bruce Banner—originally created the villainous Ultron, who menaced our heroic quintet in ""The Avengers: Age of Ultron."" Meanwhile, the years have not kind to Pym. After he exited SHIELD, he formed his own company, Pym Technologies. Sadly, Pym\'s evil protégé, Darren Cross (Corey Stoll of ""The Bourne Legacy""), has seized control and feverishly schemes to replicate the prized Pym Particle. Ironically enough, Hank\'s estranged daughter, Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly of ""Lost""), appears to be working in league with the treacherous Cross.Meantime, idealistic thief Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) leaves San Quentin after serving a three-year stretch for burglary. Actually, Scott qualifies as the most sympathetic ex-con in cinematic history. Since he divorced his wife Maggie (Judy Greer of ""Jurassic World"") but hasn\'t paid a penny of child support, Scott cannot visit his adorable daughter, Cassie (newcomer Abby Ryder Fortson), who misses him as much as he misses her. Not only does Maggie stonewall Scott, so does her smarmy fiancé, Paxton (Bobby Cannavale of ""Spy""), who happens to be a cop. Reluctantly, Scott boards with his former cellmate, Luis (a scene-stealing Michael Peña of ""Fury""), who lures him back into a life of crime. Scott struggled to go straight, even landed a job at Baskin-Robbins, but his boss learned about this prison record and fired him. Desperate to make child support money, Scott resorts to his burglary skills. He breaks into none other than Hank Pym\'s house and steals an exotic helmet and suit. Later, he discovers the outfit enables him to shrink to ant size and enhance his fighting prowess. ""Second chances don\'t come around all that often,"" Pym warns Scott. ""This is your chance to earn that look in your daughter\'s eyes, to become the hero that she already thinks you are."" Scott joins Hank in an outlandish plan to prevent the megalomaniacal Cross from selling the Pym Particle to SHIELD\'s nemesis HYDRA. Silly, superficial, and preposterous, ""Ant-Man"" delivers scores of hilarious, but suspenseful shenanigans. Until Marvel/Disney released ""Ant-Man,"" Hollywood had ignored all things petite in pursuit of the big, the bigger, and the biggest in its blockbusters. Meantime, the ever creative intellects at Marvel had been planning an ""Ant-Man"" movie since ""Shaun of the Dead"" director Edgar Wright had embarked on the project about a decade ago. Creative differences forced Wright out, and Reed took over the helm. Now, ""Ant-Man"" has emerged as the revelation of the summer, rather like the goofy ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" did last summer. From concept to casting, everything about this mighty mite of a movie is nothing short of brilliant. Consistently entertaining on all levels, ""Ant-Man"" plumbs new depths in the superhero genre and provides former superstar Michael Douglas with his best role since director David Fincher\'s 1997 thriller ""The Game."" Romantic comedy leading man Paul Rudd of ""Role Models"" is the last guy you\'d imagine as the diminutive Marvel hero. Nevertheless, the self-deprecatory Rudd succeeds with a combination of panache and charisma. He is a funny guy who doesn\'t try to be funny and comes off being even funnier. Like the eponymous creepy-crawlies that can tote ten times their body weight, ""Ant-Man"" delivers ten times more entertainment than most superhero sagas despite its downsized spectacle. Not surprisingly, this origins opus covers the roughly same ground that ""Iron Man"" did, but it does so with greater creativity on a considerably smaller scale. Clearly, those pests that habitually ruin your picnics have undergone a massive publicity campaign that places them as well as formulaic superheroes in an entirely different perspective.Altogether, ""Ant-Man"" is antastic!', 'In 1989, Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) resigns from SHIELD after realizing that Howard Stark (John Slattery) had been trying to replicate his shrinking technology.In the present day, Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) has just served his last day at San Quentin State Prison. Waiting to pick him up is his old cellmate, Luis (Michael Peña), who offers to let him stay at his apartment. Scott is unable to find a legitimate job with his criminal record. He had found out that the company he worked for had been overcharging their customers, so he hacked into the system and transferred millions of dollars back to the customers. Luis introduces him to Dave (T.I.), a getaway driver, and Kurt (David Dastmalchian), an identity theft specialist. Luis has a tip about a robbery they could do together.Hank gets invited to a presentation at the company he founded, Pym Tech. He runs into his daughter, Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), and his former protege, Darren Cross (Corey Stoll), who shows him a prototype of the Yellow Jacket suit, modeled after the Ant-Man suit that Hank wore. Darren has not had success at shrinking living tissue.Scott borrows Luis\' van and drops in on the birthday party of his daughter, Cassie (Abby Ryder Fortson). He runs into Cassie\'s soon-to-be stepfather, Officer Jim Paxton (Bobby Cannavale) , who is not happy to see him. His ex-wife, Maggie (Judy Greer) tells him that he has to find a legitimate job and pay off his delinquent child support before she\'ll allow visitation with Cassie. Jim and his partner, Gale (Wood Harris) insist that Scott leave the party after saying goodbye to Cassie.At Pym Tech, Hope and Darren are trying to shrink sheep to microscopic size. Their experiment fails, and a sheep is killed. Darren insists they press forward with another sheep.Scott realizes that it will be more than a year before he can see Cassie again if he takes a minimum-wage job, so he takes up Luis on his offer. Luis\' cousin, Ernesto (Nicholas Barrera) had a friend, Emily (Lyndsi LaRose), who was a housekeeper and was dating Ernesto\'s friend, Carlos (Carlos Aviles). She told Carlos that the man whose house she was cleaning has a giant safe that\'s sure to be holding valuables. Scott agrees to help them with the robbery.Luis picks up supplies for the break-in, and Kurt steals a communication technician\'s uniform. That night, Kurt climbs up a pole outside Hank\'s house and blocks the electrical circuit, cutting off all phone communication. Scott climbs the fence and takes out the window sensors, then pries open a window and heads to the basement. He unlocks the basement door only to find a second door that is fingerprint-coded. Using tape, he lifts Hank\'s print and opens that door. When he gets to the safe, he realizes that he\'ll need some ingenuity to break the steel door. He drills small holes around the lock, then squirts in water and uses nitrogen to freeze it. The frozen water warps the steel and causes the bolts to shoot out. When he opens the safe, the only thing inside is a weird-looking body suit and helmet. He grabs that and heads out. Meanwhile, Hank has been watching the whole episode upstairs.Dejected at not having gotten anything valuable, the group heads back to Luis\' apartment. Scott goes into the bathroom and examines the suit he stole, wondering why it was so heavily guarded. He notices tubes full of red and blue liquid. Out of curiosity, he puts it on and steps into the bathtub to get a better look at himself in the mirror. Noticing a red button on the glove, he pushes it and instantly shrinks, becoming a half-inch tall. Luis comes into the bathroom and he turns on the water in the tub, which is like a tidal wave for tiny Scott. He hears a voice coming from an earpiece in the helmet. He tries pushing a blue button to return to normal size, but it\'s broken. Panicked, he jumps away from the water and finds himself sailing across the room. He lands in a crack and falls through to the apartment below. In that room, there\'s a party going on, and Scott realizes he\'s on a record player, with the needle moving toward him. He jumps free and lands on the floor where people are dancing. Avoiding the giant footsteps, he gets under the door and into the hallway, where he is promptly sucked up into a vacuum cleaner. When the dust bag gets emptied, he jumps again, this time landing on a rat. He runs away, but lands on a mouse trap. When it\'s triggered, it sends him flying out through a window and into the rainy night. He sees raindrops as big as his head, before landing on a car. The impact jarred the blue button free, and he grows back to normal size.Scott races home and takes off the suit. Realizing that someone had been tracking him all along, he decides to return the suit to Hank\'s safe. He easily breaks into the house again and puts the suit back. But when he gets out, he\'s surrounded by cops. He is arrested and brought to prison, where Paxton is waiting for him. Gale tells Paxton that Scott\'s lawyer is there. Confused, Scott goes to see the lawyer that he hadn\'t asked for and doesn\'t know.The ""lawyer"" waiting for him is Hank. He offers Scott two choices, life in prison or follow his instructions. Scott is thoroughly bewildered, so Hank tells him that he allowed him to steal the suit. Scott is taken back to his cell, and an army of ants brings him back the suit. He puts it on and shrinks, and then quickly escapes from the prison. One of Hank\'s ants spreads its wings, and Scott climbs on and flies over the city.Hank tells Scott that he invented the suit, but was afraid it would be misused, and so he had locked it away. Darren had found out about the shrinking technology, but when Hank wouldn\'t give it to him, Darren forced Hank out of Pym Tech. When Hope realized how dangerous Darren was, she teamed up with Hank to stop him. Hank tells Scott that he needs him to become ""Ant-Man"" to stop people like Darren. Scott realizes he has a chance to become a true hero, the kind of father his daughter deserves.Scott gets trained in martial arts and how to lead the ant colonies. He practices his timing with shrinking and growing back. Hank tells him that one piece of technology he\'ll need to steal the suit from Darren is in an abandoned SHIELD building. When Scott flies to the building, he sees that it\'s the current Avengers\' headquarters. Pressing forward, Scott lands on the roof, triggering a sensor. Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) arrives to investigate, and he can see Scott even at small size. A battle ensues, with Scott going inside Falcon\'s jetpack and causing it to short out. Scott escapes with the equipment he needs.When Scott returns, Hank explains the truth about how Hope\'s mother died. There was an ICBM that had been launched at the U.S., and Hank was trying to stop it, but even at ant-size, he couldn\'t get inside. She had a similar suit, called the Wasp. She decided to shrink to sub-atomic size and was able to stop the missile, but she couldn\'t return from that size and was lost in the quantum realm.Darren Cross finally has success at shrinking a lamb. He envisions himself taking over Pym Tech. He invites Hank to the grand unveiling, then calls Hope and tells her that he has increased security, including covering all the vents with microscopic mesh. They realize the job will be harder than they thought, and they\'ll need more people. Luis, Kurt and Dave are brought in. Luis poses as a security guard and lowers the water pressure so Scott can get in through the pipes. Scott plants explosives throughout the building, but when he tries to steal the suit, he gets caught in a glass cage by Darren, who had anticipated the burglary. Darren plans to sell the technology to HYDRA. Scott breaks free and takes out the Hydra agents. Darren gets into a chopper on the roof and escapes just before the building blows up. Hank and Hope break out by turning a tiny tank to full-size, and ride it out the side of the building.Darren puts on the Yellow Jacket suit, and he and Scott fight inside the helicopter. After they both fall out, Scott is able to trap Darren inside a bug zapper, but Jim Paxton shows up to arrest him before he can destroy the suit. Darren goes to Jim and Cassie\'s house and threatens their lives, hoping to draw Scott in. Scott arrives and they fight. The only way Scott can get inside Darren\'s suit is to shrink to sub-atomic size, and he causes Darren to shrink into nothing. Lang is trapped in the quantum realm, but hearing Cassie\'s voice, he manages to rewire the suit, reversing the process and returning him to normal size. Following the battle, a grateful Paxton covers for Scott so he would not have to go back to prison. Hank wonders if Hope\'s mother is also still alive somewhere. Luis tells Scott that the Falcon is looking for him.Mid-Credit Scene: Hank shows his daughter a new Wasp prototype suit and offers it to her.Post-Credit Scene: Captain America and Falcon have the Winter Soldier in they\'re custody, and are trying to figure out what to do next. Unable to tell Iron Man due to the ""Accords"", Wilson says he knows who to contact for help.']"
39,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Captain America: Civil War,3498820,"[""The first Captain America film was a lot of fun, and 'Winter Soldier', taking a bigger, bolder and darker approach while not forgetting the entertainment value, was even better.'Civil War' is not quite as good as 'Winter Soldier' but it's a little better than the first film, in my opinion. It may not be quite the spectacular extravaganza that this reviewer was expecting from reading the critics' reviews, but it is very solid fun still, great entertainment and in the top end of Marvel's output even with its faults.Granted, 'Civil War' is not perfect, so the detractors can think again before accusing me of being someone paid to write a positive review. This is actually somebody who saw the film, enjoyed it thoroughly but realises that it has flaws. Is anybody going to point out to Marvel detractors that people can enjoy Marvel's films without feeling like it's a criminal offence to and have been giving good reasons for doing so, so parroting out ridiculous and easily disproven conspiracy theories that have often come close to violating terms and conditions is only making them look like the idiots and the ignoramuses? Sorry to point out that irrelevant note, but this attitude keeps cropping up in the increasing user and critical condescension wave that IMDb is facing, and IMDb who seem shockingly oblivious to it should come down harder on it.As with what was not quite right with 'Civil War', there is an over-stuffed and occasionally under-cooked feel at times. 'Civil War' has many subplots and characters, and while actually it deals with a vast majority of the subplots and characters are dealt with incredibly well there are a few subplots that appear (a couple of them abruptly introduced as well) and not enough is done with them, as far as being completely forgotten about after ten minutes or being rushed through to get to the next one. Zemo's story is lost within everything else and would have fared better within a film all on its own, because the potential was there. A vast majority of the characters are all interesting with engaging, in-depth personalities, but War Machine is somewhat side-lined, while one appreciates the complexity given to Zemo there was the sense that he wasn't as completely crucial to the main story as he could have been and while Spiderman really grows on you his entrance is a bit clumsily done and makes one think does he really belong? However, 'Civil War' also does a huge amount right. It looks amazing for a start, the gritty but audacious look of 'Winter Soldier' makes a welcome return while the cinematography is stylish, the editing crisp (if slightly and occasionally confused in the airport action sequence) and the special effects as extravagant as they should, helped by thunderously authentic sound. Despite really not being a fan of shaky cam usually, it is not abused here, doesn't cause visual discomfort and gave certain scenes even more raw tension than they already had. The music again has much rousing excitement and haunting intensity while being no less memorable than the music in the previous two outings.The action sequences in 'Civil War' are strong too. The opening sequence starts the film with a bang, with its tragic consequences being genuinely affecting, while the airport scene is tense, enormous fun and thrilling (though because with so much going on, the camera/editing does at times struggle to keep up). Best of all is the climax, which had much more intensity and was surprisingly rich in conflict and emotion. The direction is astute and deftly balances all the different conflicts and tone shifts, while the script is very smartly written with the light-hearted moments like with Spiderman and Ant-Man being witty and hilarious while not once being at odds with the more thought-provoking and serious elements (which never get bogged down in too much talk). The story, while a bit over-stuffed and under-cooked in places, is never dull, never feels too stretched or thin, always makes sense (even with parts that needed more development) and is endlessly riveting right up to the end, which is an achievement for a two and a half hour film with this much going on. Likewise, while some characters are more interesting than others (which is standard for any film with a cast as large as this), the characters are very intriguingly and engagingly written with distinct personalities and realism.There are great performances across the board, with the one oddity being Marisa Tomei as Aunt May, not a big role but not small enough to give the impression that Tomei in age and manner did not fit the character. Much of the film however is dominated by Robert Downey Jnr and Chris Evans, both of whom are note-perfect as Iron Man and Captain America. Elizabeth Olsen is flawed but sympathetic, Scarlett Johansson is wonderfully fearless, Paul Rudd is a breath of fresh air with his introduction actually feeling like a character who belongs, Tom Holland brings endearing enthusiasm to Spiderman, Paul Bettany and Sebastian Stan are authoritative presences, Daniel Bruhl has the right degree of arrogance and is able to convey menace while only doing as little as a whisper and Chadwick Boseman characterises Black Panther's wounded pride with dignity and gravitas.Overall, very solid fun if just missing out on being the spectacular extravaganza expected. 8/10 Bethany Cox"", ""CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR is another Marvel Cinematic Universe flick that sees the series going from strength to strength; this is better than the last two CAPTAIN AMERICA films and on par with the highs of THE AVENGERS. The plot speaks for itself and takes things to an enjoyable political level as Iron Man and Captain America find themselves on opposing sides of the law. Despite a massive running time, this is a fast-paced and hugely enjoyable production, with a large cast featuring all manner of new superhero faces (Ant Man, Black Panther, and Spider-Man all make their appearances here). The film's high point is undoubtedly the action choreography, which mixes wire work, seamless CGI, and expert fight choreography into a satisfying whole. The opening sequence with Frank Grillo's returning bad guy gets things off to a fantastic start and is only bettered by the incredible airport fight later on. All of the usual faces here and are either given a lot or a little to work with, and there's the right balance of humour and excitement, thrills and fun. I loved it."", 'Captain America: Civil War (2016) *** (out of 4)Politics enter The Avengers as they are asked to sign an agreement, which would basically put them under control of the U.N.. Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) wants them to sign but Captain America (Chris Evans) believes it\'s a bad idea and soon the two are divided and a civil war breaks out among The Avengers.CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR is another high-powered and fast entry into the Marvel series that is hands out the best thing out there in regards to comic book movies. I\'ve honestly never read a single comic book in my life so I might not be the main audience for a film like this but it\'s very easy to see why this series has been such a hit with critics and fans. This is yet another highly entertaining film and it\'s certainly a lot of fun, which is something missing from so many comic movies today.Of course, the greatest thing about this is that there are so many super heroes gathered up in one movie. Not only is there Iron Man and Captain America but we\'ve also got Black Widow, Winter Soldier, Falcon, War Machine, Black Panther, Hawkeye, Scarlet Witch, Ant-Man and yes, Spider Man makes an appearance. I won\'t spoil the divide that happens in the film but there\'s a lot of great characters here and thankfully the ""story"" is kept to a minimum and instead we\'re just given one great action sequence after another.As you\'d expect, by this time all the actors are perfectly fit in their characters and there\'s no question that the studio being able to get the right actors for the parts is one reason this franchise has succeeded so greatly. The film certainly looks great but once again I\'ve only got one real complaint and that\'s the fact that the film ran on way too long. I\'m sorry, but 147-minutes for a movie like this just isn\'t really needed.', ""In Lagos, Captain America, Black Widow, Falcon, and Scarlet Witch stop Brock Rumlow but cause collateral damage killing some Wakandans. U.S. Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross informs the Avengers that the world has come together to take control of them under the Sokovia Accords. King T'Chaka of Wakanda is killed in a bombing during the signing by apparently Bucky Barnes. Prince T'Challa intends to kill Bucky while Captain America intends to capture him alive. The situation spirals out of control to split the Avengers apart.The MCU has become a long running serial show. The brilliance is that it works so well. They are fun. There is value in their connectivity. Sometimes, comic book movies have comic book motivations which often annoy me. The trick for this movie is that everybody's motivations work. The exception is yet another flawed MCU villain, Helmut Zemo. Taking him aside, the heroes have realistic motivations and actions. There is a great introduction of Spider-Man. Tom Holland is terrific and that franchise looks well on its way. His humor is a bit of fresh air. It didn't occur to me before but MCU humor has been mostly sarcastic cynicism. There is no cynicism in this Peter Parker and it's great youthful exuberance. Black Panther is also well-introduced and Ant-Man adds some great humor on top of Spider-Man. The conflict between Iron Man and Captain America is well developed. The romance between Scarlet Witch and Vision is intriguing. On the other hand, Cap's romance is questionable. The airport scene is something else. It may be the best comic book fight ever. This is what Marvel does and they do it well."", 'My son informed me tonight that the reason I was confused by this film is that a missed a previous Avengers movie. I try to enjoy these comic book movies and am always astonished how personally people take them. In this one, we are treated to so many characters with different skills and agendas that it is hard to know who to pull for, who is lugging around guilt, and who some of them even are. I was told there is character development. I don\'t see it. The milieu into which these persons are thrust seems to be so tilted that they really need to keep working. Lets face it. If there are casualties when they ply their individual trades, imagine the carnage without them. Of course, I had all I could do to figure out which side they are on. I guess ""Civil War"" means that they are fighting among themselves in their own universe. What are the motivations? My son also informed me that there are at least a dozen or more superhero films coming out in the next two years. Good God! I love a plot where a villain has created some malevolent thing that only special powers can stop. It would be nice if there weren\'t a tidal wave of superheroes.', '""Captain America: Civil War"" is the third biggest commerical success movie-wise from 2016 and of course this was a new installment to the Marvel Avengers franchise. The title here makes it sound like a Captain American film and while he probably does have more screen time and more significance than pretty much all the other characters, he is not at the very center of it all as much as you could think from the title. But first things first: The directors are brothers Anthony and Joe Russo and they are Emmy winners just like their writers here Chris Markus and Stephen McFeely with whom they collaborated on other occasions too, also on a previous Captain America movie. But back to this one here. With the exception of Hulk and Thor, you have all the Avengers in here basically, some very brief only, but others with more screen time. And Spider Man joins the gang too. Plus Black Panther before his own movie. At 2 hours 30 minutes roughly, it is a really long film, even for a Marvel movie.The main antagonist this time is played by Daniel Brühl, but he is really more of a schemer than a villain. On one occasion towards the end he says something along the lines of the Avengers having defeated much stronger opponents, so his only chance to destroy them is to cause conflict from within, which means provoke the Avengers in going up against one another. And he does come pretty close in fact, for example when showing us how Iron Man\'s parents were killed. There is a civil war between two groups of Avengers eventually and the original cause of conflict refers to innocent victims during fights between Avengers and super villains. Are they evitable? How much guilt do the Avengers carry with them? These innocent victims also explain Brühl\'s character\'s motives, even if somehow this explanation did feel a bit weak to me given the huge uproar it creates with Avengers fighting each other for death and life. Oh well maybe Thor\'s physical superiority as well as Hulk\'s muscles would not have fit in there. Then again, they probably won\'t care too much about human victims either. C.A. could have needed this duo I suppose.All in all, it was an okay movie I think, not among the best or worst the Avengers have to offer, certainly not as good as Infinity War, but better than Age of Ultron for example. And the story felt pretty creative as well, certainly different for once and the idea of the actual conflict and how it is like a battle from within this time, not the traditional fight against a powerful enemy (Thanos anyone?) made for a nice change. The late Stan Lee has perhaps his funniest cameo in any Avengers film here and I already wondered if I had overlooked him this time because he entered the movie so late. As for the cast list all in all, it is really a star-studded ensemble, but yeah obviously this was going to be another big hit, that much was safe, so it should not come as a surprise to anybody that the likes of Tomei, Freeman, Hurt and Slattery are included in here. For me the last two were really a nice little surprise as I think Hurt is easily among the finest actors from his generation and how can you not love John Slattery, Mad Men fan or not. Shame he was gone so quickly.Yes there are a few aspects I did not like, but these weren\'t too frequent. One was fairly considerable though, namely how quickly Stark changed his mind eventually and reunited with his old buddies, even if they were criminals now. This left a bit of a sour note overall without a doubt. Also seeing tiny Spider Man being able to stand up against the real superheroes did not feel too realistic, he really seemed like a liability to me with his lack of experience. But for me, the presence of Ant-Man, regardless of him being small, normal-sized or a giant was very welcome. Love Paul Rudd and the character, maybe even my favorite from the whole gang. I probably don\'t need to make a recommendation here as honestly, if you consider watching this one, you should have seen enough Marvel material already to decide for yourself, but if I had to, it would be a positive recommendation for sure, not an enthusiastic one, but yeah, the good aspects here are far more frequent than the weaker aspects. A bit surprised this one did not get in at the Oscars at all. Go see it nonetheless. Oh well, pretty much everybody already has anyway, right? It\'s fun, not entirely pointless even, and runs by quickly, does not feel like 150 minutes at all.', ""Thematically this film has similarities to rival DC Comics/Warner Brothers Batman v Superman. Who watches the Watchmen, sorry superheroes.This is the question asked in Civil War after a disastrous incident in Lagos involving Captain America and his team but the powers that be led by General Ross now the US Secretary of State that various incidents involving The Avengers either as a team or individuals has led to collateral damage. In short, innocent people have died.The film sets up a confrontation between Captain America and Iron Man and the various superheroes choose sides with new additions including Ant Man, Black Panther and Spiderman. Iron Man feels that there should be scrutiny or oversight by an external body like the UN. Captain America has concerns, rightly so after all he revealed Shield as being corrupted in the previous film and so nervous about history repeating itself.History does play an important part in the film. The Winter Soldier has history both with Steve Rogers and Tony Stark. Something just ripe to be manipulated by the film's villain Zemo who is planning the moves to pit the various heroes against each other.What the directors, the Russos get right here is a layered story with action pieces that are well paced. Some of the action sequences in the early part of the film are maybe too fast and frenetic with almost cartoon like action.The new version of Spiderman is introduced here and along with Ant Man they are there to add zippy humour and expand the Avengers universe."", ""I was not overly taken with the previous Avengers film, but I have enjoyed the Captain America series – although, being honest, if I watched them unaware of the title, I would not be able to tell one over the other with much success. This one in particular feels like an ensemble piece (as they all do) although the return of the Winter Soldier and the focus on Captain America does make it fit. The plot as themes of vigilantism, of revenge, of anger, all of which spin around each other with an air that suggests the film is trying to blur moral lines between the characters.In theory it does this reasonably well – or at least to describe it out loud it sounds like it must work. In the film though it doesn't seem to push for this aspect so much as just use it. So the film is driven by this, and all the characters have equal validity and tragedy to their motivations; however this is not the same as it being done with a lot of brain and heart. In this regard it doesn't deliver, although it does provide a more interesting base than the usual 'global threat from beyond' that some of the other films have had. On this it builds good action; for sure they are often large and with plenty going on, but many have good fluidity of movement and dramatic delivery – the action has some weight to it, rather than feeling like watching someone play a video game.The performances are all well-judged, with good mix of humor and dramatic presence. For sure it is not a film where the actors will bother the awards season too much, but they sell their characters and their threads well. There are perhaps too many characters for them to really do them all justice (Spiderman for instance feels rushed into the film, and more about making another film I think); by contrast a cameo for Antman was enjoyable. Mostly the focus is kept reasonably tight on the main few, and the new characters generally add to the themes (Black Panther).It isn't brilliant but it is an enjoyable blockbuster with an interesting narrative base, enjoyable plotting, and action which does more than just wiggle its CGI in your face."", 'More superhero infighting.The reasons are similar to the Batman/Superman thing, vigilante action causing collateral damage irregardless of the fact they are saving the world. The world wants to control the Avengers under a set of protocols. Some agree to them, while others do not and it was opposite from what I expected. Meanwhile there is a bad guy who is not a bad guy sometimes and a friend of Captain America except when he does bad things...so pay attention.I thought the film was about as entertaining as the last one until the end which explodes on the screen with action, humor, and drama.... and we get a non-formula ending.The film also introduces some new Avengers, of which the geeky Tom Holland gets to be Spider-Man. Paul Rudd as Ant Man joins the group in a small role. It is interesting to watch the Avengers battle as there is a lot of talking going on between themselves. The infighting seemed a bit ridiculous and could have been easily avoided, but that film would not be as exciting to watch. Whoever is doing the stunts, my hat is off to them especially Crystal Hooks, Heidi Moneymaker who doubled for Scarlett Johannson. Incredible. No Hulk or Thor or Pepper. Great action film. Iron Man/Stark not as funny and crisp as he was in the past. He was better as a straight man with Spider-Man:Peter Parker: ""I can\'t go to Germany."" Tony Stark: ""Why Not?"" Peter Parker: ""I got homework.""What made the whole film unbelievable was the Stark Compound chess board was set up with white square in the left corner and not right.The film is less preachy in its theme. Non-Avenger Lives matter? Don\'t handcuff the troops? Revenge is a dish best served cold?Minimal PG-13 swearing', ""For some apparently the answer is absolutely nothing. But if you bought into the Marvel Universe thing, then you know how they roll. It doesn't mean the movies are all the same. Quite the opposite, as Dr. Strange showed us. But even here you get political statements. And if it didn't do that the movie probably would have been seen as just another Comic Book movie that didn't take it's role model position to also have a message for the viewers.But do not despair, there is plenty of action in there. It's just that the movie does try to make you think about things and challenge you a bit. Also it does want to show that there are consequences to actions taken. Whether you agree with that approach or not is up to you. And again, there is enough action and fun to be had. You can take anything apart if you really want to and make it look bad, but you would take away a lot of fun that you can have."", 'If ever there was a movie that could be considered a metaphor for the times, \'Civil War\' would be the one. It displays many of the primary conflicting ideologies at play in the country and the world today - globalism vs. nationalism, liberalism vs conservatism, gun control fanatics vs Second Amendment enthusiasts, and one could go on. I recall directors Anthony and Joe Russo describing their previous \'Winter Soldier\' project as a commentary on present day, big government spying and terror-suspect \'kill lists\', and this film extends the approach. The brother directors continue on that tangent here by putting Marvel\'s main iconic characters in diametrically opposed corners while exploring the concepts of freedom versus government control. What\'s kind of interesting too is that the story line allows the viewer to make up one\'s own mind, which one can observe by reading the reviews and message boards. Personally, I\'m on Captain America\'s side in this argument, but I\'ll let him say it - ""My faith\'s in people, I guess. Individuals."" Which is why I was disappointed in Tony Stark\'s decision to sign the United Nations Accords, though in a way it made sense. As a major industrialist relying on government contracts to fuel his business enterprises, he must have felt he had to go along to get along. This might all be just a bit too heavy for the average movie goer looking for the latest in blockbuster special effects and mind blowing action, but it\'s the subtext in these pictures that grab my attention, and this picture did it. So now we\'ll have to wait and see what happens in the next installment, as it seems Iron Man is somewhat remorseful for going up against Cap and his team. And besides, we can\'t leave Bucky, Clint and Scott sitting in their jail cells. Once again, nice job kudos to Stan Lee as the Fed Ex guy delivering a package for Mr. Stank. The man turns ninety four!!! this year, and when I just checked, it turns out he shares my birthday! Wow, I hope he keeps cranking them out forever!', 'Political interference in the Avengers\' activities causes a rift between former allies Captain America and Iron Man.I see some people calling this the best Marvel film yet, and right now it sits at a 7.9 on IMDb. I would have to respectfully disagree with these champions of the film. While I do think it is a decent plot, and does a fine job of showing the philosophical differences between Iron Man and Captain America, it has two big issues for me.One, it is far too dependent on CGI. I would rather see more physical effects, even if they might be less ""spectacular"". Frankly, I am not impressed by the CGI because any time something happens action-wise, it becomes very obvious the characters are drawn in and not played by actors. I understand that action is important to a superhero movie, but why must it be the worst-looking part? And two, while the plot does do something for character development, it really has very little to offer as far as a story. The characters seem to have very little growth. My impression is the whole point of the film was merely to set up Spider-Man and Black Panther for their own films. It definitely didn\'t do much for anyone else.', ""This is not technically a sequel to the Captain America series, it is more like another Avengers movie, the only Marvel characters missing are Nick Fury, Thor and the Hulk, so I looked forward to it, from director brothers Anthony and Joe Russo (Welcome to Collinwood, You, Me and Dupree, Captain America: The Winter Soldier). Basically the Avengers: Steve Rogers aka Captain America (Chris Evans), Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Sam Wilson aka Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and Wanda Maximoff aka Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen, Mary-Kate and Ashley's sister) cause unintentional destruction whilst saving the world, the team are brought before U.S. Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt). Ross informs the team that the United Nations (UN) will have a panel determine their control for protection of the world, the team is divided: Tony Stark aka Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) supports oversight because he feels the destruction, but Rogers has more faith in his judgement than the government. A bomb explosion occurs in Vienna, security footage indicates the bomber is brainwashed super-soldier Bucky Barnes aka Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), King T'Chaka (John Kani) is killed and his son T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) vows to kill the Barnes. The government intends to kill Barnes, Rogers wants to bring him, as his childhood friend and war comrade, Rogers and Wilson find him in Bucharest, but they, Barnes and T'Challa, as his alter ego the Black Panther, are arrested. Helmut Zemo (Rush's Daniel Brühl) kills Barnes's old Hydra handler and steals a book containing trigger words that activate Barnes's brainwashing, infiltrating the facility Barnes is being held Zemo recites these words to make Barnes obey him, Zemo questions him, then sends him on a rampage. Rogers stops Barnes, he regains his senses and explains that Zemo is the real Vienna bomber, he wanted the location of of the Siberian Hydra base, where other brainwashed super-soldiers are kept in cryogenic stasis, unwilling to wait for authorisation to apprehend Zemo, Rogers and Wilson go rogue, recruiting Maximoff, Clint Barton aka Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Scott Lang aka Ant-Man (Paul Rudd). Ross gives permission to Stark to capture the renegades, he assembles Romanoff and T'Challa in a team, along with Lieutenant James Rhodes aka War Machine (Don Cheadle), Vision (Paul Bettany) and new recruit Peter Parker aka Spider-Man (The Impossible's Tom Holland). Stark's team and Rogers' team come face to face at Leipzig/Halle Airport, they fight each other and cause destruction around them, until Romanoff allows Rogers and Barnes to escape, the rest of Rogers' team are captured and held at the Raft prison, Vision inadvertently shot down Rhodes causing him to be partially paralysed, and Romanoff is forced to go into hiding. Stark discovers evidence that Zemo framed Barnes and shows Wilson the evidence, Wilson gives Rogers' location, Stark goes to the Siberian Hydra facility, Rogers and Barnes are there and they strike a truce, T'Challa secretly followed, they discover the other super-soldiers have been killed Zemo, who shows Hydra archive footage that brainwashed Barnes was responsible for the death of Stark's parents, thought to be killed in an automobile accident. Stark is enraged that Rogers was aware of this and turns on them, blasting off Barnes' robotic arm, Rogers disables Stark's armour and escapes with Barnes, leaving his shield behind, Zemo is satisfied he has fractured the Avengers and attempts suicide, but T'Challa stops him and takes him to the authorities. In the aftermath, Rhodes is provided with exoskeletal leg braces to walk again, Rogers breaks his allies out of the Raft, Barnes is granted asylum by T'Challa and put into cryogenic sleep until a cure for his brainwashing can be found, Stark reads a letter from Rogers which assures him there can be a future for the Avengers, and Parker is seen testing a new gadget from Stark. Also starring Emily VanCamp as Sharon Carter, Frank Grillo as Brock Rumlow aka Crossbones, Martin Freeman as Everett K. Ross, Marisa Tomei as Aunt May Parker, John Slattery as Howard Stark, Hope Davis as Maria Stark, Alfre Woodard as Miriam Sharpe and Stan Lee as FedEx Driver. Evans and Downey Jr. dominate most of the picture with their acting skills, but it is great to see all the superheroes together again, the highlight is when they all clash, fight together and destroy an airport, the introductions of the Black Panther and web-slinging Spider-Men is well done, there is a good mixture of high-octane energy and a little needed humour, the special effects for the super powers and explosions are fantastic, and the story is relatively interesting, all in all it is a great fun action adventure. Very good!"", 'While I am not overly a fan of the superhero genre, then I will still watch these movies when I have a chance, because they tend to be entertaining enough and usually be a visual treat in special effects.And that was true also with the 2016 ""Captain America: Civil War"" movie. Sure, the whole superhero thing is starting to wear thin in my book, but it should be said that there is enough action and impressive effects in this movie to make it worthwhile watching.For fans of the superhero movies, then I think that ""Captain America: Civil War"" would be like a mother of all movies, because there are so many different superheroes together, with myriads of backgrounds and powers.The story in the movie was adequate, albeit a bit simplistic. But it was easy to follow and it doesn\'t really require much thinking from the audience. Just sit back and enjoy the action, the fighting and the sparkling special effects.Personally I like Ant Man the best, because he is played by Paul Rudd and also because he is the one with the funniest and weirdest of all powers.I can\'t really say whether or not this movie is extraordinary compared to the other ones in the same Marvel universe, because to me they are essentially all the same, just with different characters. But it sure was entertaining enough for about two and a half hours.', ""I've rather stupidly watched the MCU films in completely the wrong order, which sometimes makes it challenging to keep up with who's who and why they're doing what they're doing. That said, this one is fairly easy to sum up: the Avengers have a falling out, with disagreements over how their activities should be regulated, and loyalties divided over the winter soldier, who has been framed for a series of terrorist attacks.With the superheroes locking horns, the scene is set for some spectacular fight scenes, which is what the Avengers films do so well. Civil War also introduces us to the Black Panther and the new Spiderman and gives us a lot more of Antman, which is a good thing, these characters providing many of the film's thrills, with Spidey and Antman upfront and centre for the most impressive scene, a battle at an airport that sees the aircraft used as weapons!Admittedly, the villain of the piece, a soldier seeking revenge for the death of his family in Zokovia, is a bit weak, but this character is merely there to serve as the catalyst for the jaw-dropping smackdowns between our heroes; in this respect, he serves his purpose well enough.7.5/10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb."", 'I watched this at home on DVD from my public library. This one again stars Chris Evans as Steve Rogers and Captain America. But it also includes a whole potful of other stars, too many to mention in my brief comments here.On the plus side the special effects and sound track, with plenty of surround and deep bass, are first-rate. On the negative side, I have a basic dislike for this type of story that has most of the superheros fighting each other. It was the same for me in the recent ""Batman v Superman"" movie. I suppose the movie makers are always scrambling for new ways to make the stories interesting but this just doesn\'t work for me.The other gripe is the heavy emphasis on massive destruction during the fights. I realize many fans crave this and like to see all the destruction but for me it takes away greatly from my enjoyment.So what we have here is basically the whole world getting upset that the band of superheros jump into frays without any guidance, they do their own things, and often there is severe collateral damage, even the deaths of innocent people. Since they have super powers it is difficult to require them to comply, and during most of the middle of the movie the various supers battle each other. It isn\'t pretty.Overall a fail, in my opinion.', 'What are \'stakes\' when it comes to super-heroes? How do they function when it comes to protecting people over the world and saving us from the enemies? What if there\'s destruction? How can people be trusted? Or, more philosophically, can the heroes trust themselves if they have to live with the deaths at their hands (or can they)? So many questions are at the heart of Captain America: Civil War, the sort of sequel-cum-culmination of a lot of plot threads and emotional stakes that have been set up since Iron Man 1 in 2008. It feels earned, and it\'s hard to not think of the immediate comparison of the other big super-hero beat-down of this year, Batman v Superman. Those comparisons could last all day, but I think it\'s also apt, even more-so, to think of this as a criticism of X-Men Last Stand, which was another film that had super-hero ""registration"" as far as being under control and the different factions that pop up and sides taken as far as who is right and wrong and the grey areas.But where that film felt too cluttered by characters, Civil War is not. It very easily could\'ve been, and it\'s easy to see it as not only are characters from the Iron Man and Captain America series here (Pepper Potts is out and Peggy Carter passes on early in this film, but that\'s fine, less potential clutter). But there are also additional characters from other movies (Ant-Man) and even a new character, a friendly neighborhood kid from Queens (you know him if you saw any images in the past month for even a nano-second, it\'s not as if the internet does a good job of keeping things on the low-down, it\'s Spider-Man), and yet everyone has a purpose, every character of some significance is given time to have a conversation and to talk about things so we know where they\'re coming from (i.e. Scarlet Witch and the Vision even do, which is a great couple of scenes), and so on.The Russo brothers do a fantastic job of keeping things emotionally speaking with Rogers and Stark clear and yet complicated; we know that the deaths of so many in an explosion at the start of the film weighs down on Rogers (though perhaps we don\'t see it as much), while for Stark it\'s thrown in his face every other moment of every day, and the turmoil is there on his face all the time (though Downey Jr is such a gifted actor as to show it just enough and to modulate the turmoil so that it comes at striking times, all of it in the eyes, it\'s really one of his best performances of his career). So as this goes on the plot keeps going as well, with Daniel Bruhl playing a variation on a character in the comics (who I\'m not familiar with but it doesn\'t matter) named Zemo.This is an interesting villain and one of the better ones in the series (not Loki or Ultron level great but close), as he is *just a guy*. He\'s not some ultra criminal mastermind - though he certainly knows how to set up a mass explosion - but he is also someone who is another person who has the vast well of grief and vengeance from people he\'s lost (family but also just, as he says, ""everyone"") from his home in Slovakia. It\'s a good performance from Bruhl too, not too over the top (close to it but more realistic), and it\'s a play on past conflicts from other MCU movies. Yet here it makes its mark more because, well, this time it\'s more about how to tear up the super-heroes by doing it from the inside, which itself is reflective of SHIELD being taken down by Hydra in Winter Soldier and the seeds of doubt already there in \'Ultron\'. It\'s a pretty strong creation for this particular movie.This is a very operatic type of movie - The Empire Strikes Back gets name-checked and it almost feels like a bold statement, like \'really, did you just make that even in a jesting manner in this big bad-a** action sequence at this airport - but damn if it doesn\'t try and possibly does live up to that standard of blockbuster excellence. It\'s a lot of fun though, there\'s lightness and quips and jokes and moments visually, filmmaking wise, that makes this something that will entertain you if you\'re only looking for surface thrills. And at the same time I found a lot underneath, and what it all leads up to makes things devastating for the characters. It\'s not perfect - I have parts I can pick at as far as a particular character\'s fate following the battle, and a speech given at a funeral scene is so on the nose that there\'s barely a nose left to see - but it\'s about as good as mainstream action spectacle gets.', ""Like the recent DC movie, Batman vs. Superman, this Marvel movie has hero pitted against hero, in this case-Captain America against Iron Man. The conflict was handled more believably here than there. Other superheroes also participate including yet another new version of Spider-Man. This was mostly awesome from beginning to end unlike the DC movie which didn't make sense some of the time. Also unlike B vs. S, this one didn't seem too long even though it's only about 5 minutes shorter than that one. Oh, and Stan Lee makes another amusing cameo here, too! Plenty of great action abound so on that note, yes, Captain America: Civil War comes highly recommended."", 'This film tells the story of The Avengers who have to be regulated in view of the mass devastation they cause during their missions. However, they are divided on this issue, and neither side is unwilling to back down.It is interesting to see a ""Captain America"" film becoming an ensemble film, moving from a film about a character to a film like ""The Avengers"". I am slightly disappointed by this, because I like Captain Rogers. However, the resultant story is full of adventure and marvel, exactly because there are many characters involved. The film brings in Ant Man, and even Spiderman, making the film rich with personalities and magical powers (meaning great special effects).Marvel certainly knows how to make an entertaining superhero action film, with a good balance of adrenaline and comedy. And there are two bonus scenes, remember to stay until the end of the credits.', 'The Avengers are in trouble. Because quite a few innocent people were accidentally killed during their many battles the government wants to rein them in. They draft a bill that makes it clear that the Avengers only go into battle when the government allows them too. Iron Man, Black Widow and a few others sign it. Captain America, Falcon and others won\'t. This leads to an all out battle.Just GREAT movie--overflowing with good acting and wonderful action scenes. It moves quickly--the 147 minutes flew by. This did everything right that ""Batman vs. Superman"" did so badly. It\'s serious but also has a sharp sense of humor and some VERY funny lines from Spiderman. Only two debits--Sebastian Stan is bad as Bucky and the way Scarlet Witch was treated at the end was vicious beyond belief. Still this is a wonderful comic book film well worth your time.', ""DISCLAIMER: I read Marvel's Civil War four or more years ago and I believe it is the best story arc ever written. Not only does the story arc include almost every character in the Marvel comic world, it has an incredibly relevant and sound basis. Hence, I was very skeptical of the movie because it had so much to live up to.That's how blown away I was with the movie because they adapted it well for the screen and made a compelling enough story that wasn't too simplistic. Some may say that this was nothing more than a Marvel version of Batman v. Superman. Not even. This story existed well before that movie came out and the Batman v. Superman impetus was very contrived (a Gotham City character interacting with a Metropolis character and the simple moralistic reasons they fought). Civil War, as the name implies, was far more encompassing than simply two superegos battling it out with one having an epiphany mid-fight. This is the best crossover multi-character movie to date.You may ask about the action because after all this is a big budget superhero movie. Don't worry your little head about that. With 12 of Marvel's finest partaking in a battle you are sure to see plenty of well choreographed fighting and an equal amount of quips and one-liners.But the action isn't the reason for the excellent review; it all goes back to the story. It's been a while since I've seen a superhero story this well written. They stuck to the true essence of the Civil War story arc (that being superhero registration) while adapting it to introduce characters not originally apart of the story AND making the story believable enough to have a final showdown.Sometimes, in an effort to get an epic fight, a movie will throw together a very elementary plot that has all the complexity of a game of tag. Basically a simple misunderstanding or good guy turned rogue and two friends are in a Battle Royal. Civil War's plot was more layered, more multi-dimensional and more thought provoking. Civil War had something for everyone and for sure when it was over you had chosen a side."", 'Walt Disney Studios should have changed the title from ""Captain America: Civil War"" to ""Captain America: Stalemate"" since none of the heroes who square off against each other die. Co-directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo, who helmed ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier,"" have the two rival divisions, led by Captain America and Iron Man, knocking the shenanigans out of each other in this contrived, drawn-out, 147 minute epic. Nevertheless, the worst thing that happens is War Machine loses control of his Iron Man style armored suit and makes a crash landing in a field. Although he suffers spinal damage, Lieutenant James Rhodes is back up and walking around with some difficulty before fade0ut. Mind you, ""Captain America: Civil War"" amounts to a letdown when nobody puts anybody down permanently. Ultimately, the two fractions emerge evenly matched. Nobody like S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent Phil Coulson is around to die and make an impact like in ""Marvel\'s ""The Avengers"" (2012). At least the recent DC Comics movie ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" pretended to kill off one of the two title characters. Of course, anybody with a grain of sense knows that the adversary that perished in ""Batman v Superman"" isn\'t dead. Furthermore, the DC Comics extravaganza at least staged a funeral and the characters engaged in a period of mourning. Although the premise that Captain America and Iron Man would clash is certainly attention-grabbing, the movie pulls its punches because the superheroes emerge with little more than either bruises on themselves or scratches on their respective outfits. Despite several competently orchestrated physical confrontations, ""Captain America: Civil War"" rarely generates a modicum of suspense about its outcome. Basically, the Russo brothers stage one memorable fight at an evacuated airport, clear up the mystery behind the death of Tony Stark\'s parents, and introduce a new costume-clad character to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The Black Panther makes his debut, but he seems rather tame compared with the other Marvel champs. At one point, ""Captain America: Civil War"" seems more interested in rebooting the Spider-Man franchise than doing something with its protagonists that its PG-13 rating would condone. Sadly enough, the characters that stand out here aren\'t the title characters. Indeed, Spider-Man and Ant Man make a greater impression than any of the other Marvel titans, and Black Panther looks like Mardi Gras was his destination, and he paused to participate.Approximately three characters die in ""Captain America: Civil War."" United at the outset, our heroes descend upon Lagos and tangle with former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Brock Rumlow, (Frank Grillo of ""The Purge: Anarchy"") a.k.a. Crossbones and his thugs who want to hijack a deadly biological weapon. Crossbones tries to kill Captain America with an explosion that obliterates his own life. Miraculously, the telekinetic Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen of ""Godzilla"") contains the blast and shifts it elsewhere to do its harm. Unfortunately, the blast shatters a nearby building, killing many unseen, innocent bystanders. The collateral damage fallout from the incident brings the Avengers under scrutiny. Afflicted with a guilty conscience about the death of an African-American lad in Logas, Tony Stark advocates the Sokovia Accords drawn up by the United Nations. Essentially, the Sokovia Accords establishes a panel to supervise the Avengers. Apparently, the indestructible Avengers may be responsible for killing more people than their own adversaries owing to the collateral damage that they have wrought during their escapades. Captain America (Chris Evans of ""The Fantastic Four"") abhors the idea, and he refuses to ink the pact. The death of Agent Peggy Carter solidifies his negative attitude toward the Sokovia Accords. A longtime Avengers adversary, U.S. Secretary of State Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross (William Hurt of ""Dark City"") now enjoys a position with more prestige than power over them. Ross, you may recall, has been the bane of the Hulk. Matters grow even more serious. Steve Rogers\' World War II pal Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan of Captain America: The Winter Soldier"") is suspected of a igniting a deadly blast in Vienna where the Accords were being signed. Surveillance cameras show that Bucky was in town when the incident occurred. The blast kills King T\'Chaka of Wakanda (John Kani of ""The Wild Geese""), and his acrobatic son T\'Challa (Chadwick Boseman of ""42"") dons a black bulletproof suit, a mask with cat ears, and gloves with retractable claws and embarks as The Black Panther to avenge his father\'s death. One of the many problems with ""Captain America: Civil War"" is that it bristles with far too many characters who do far too little to each other. Eventually, T\'Challa will have his own stand alone movie, but he looks shoehorned into this film with nothing memorable to do. Worst of all, the chief villain is a family-guy-turned-vigilante, Helmut Zemo (Daniel Brühl of ""Rush""), who is a rather dreary fellow compared with previous Marvel antagonists.Anybody familiar with the Marvel Comics graphic novel will tell you ""Captain America"" scenarists Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely have taken liberties with the source material. In the Mark Millar graphic novel, lesser costume clad warriors destroyed an elementary school while a reality-TV crew photographed their endeavors. This wholesale destruction prompted the President of the United States to enact the Superhero Registration Act to make superheroes more accountable for their actions. Furthermore, the law required these costume-clad crusaders to divulge their true identities. Now, these heroes face the prospect of serving as Federal employees or facing arrest. Iron Man supports the act. ""Becoming public employees makes perfect sense,"" he proclaims, ""if it helps people sleep a little easier."" Captain America opposes it, ""Super heroes need to stay above that stuff or Washington starts telling us who the super-villains are."" Later, Iron Man tricks Captain America and his Secret Avengers into responding to a fire at petrochemical plant where hundreds people could die. Ultimately, Captain America surrenders after Iron Man beats him into submission.""Captain America: Civil War"" isn\'t half as good as the previous two ""Avengers"" movies.', ""After an unfortunate incident in Africa, the UN decides that the Avengers require oversight and sets to passing a resolution that a UN entity control the Avengers. Tony Stark is for this, Captain America against it. When the UN meeting where the resolution is about to be debated is attacked, and several UN representatives killed, it appears to be the work of Winter Soldier. Captain America is convinced of his innocence, Tony Stark is convinced that he is guilty. This sets the two against each other, with the other Avengers choosing sides.I'm not a fan of comic book movies, though did enjoy the three Iron Men movies and Captain America: The Winter Soldier. The better ones have more to offer than just your usual CGI-action. Unfortunately, this is not one of those. Pretty much CGI-action and nothing else, made for the kids who wonder who would win in a fight between Iron Man and Captain America.Basic plot, with new super heroes introduced simply because the producers can. One such character is Spider Man, who is incredibly irritating. Certainly a reason to skip the Spider Man movie. One for fans of comic book movies only."", "". . . are led by that Notorious Fat Cat, Tony Stark (a.k.a., Ironman). Even Pepper Potts has tired of his Pompous Conspicuous Consumption, and tendency to sign up with the Fascist Appeasers without reading the Fine Print. CAPTAIN AMER!CA (a.k.a., Steve Rogers) realizes that the U.S. Founding Fathers would barf at the concept of a billionaire, and that these Patriots won the Revolutionary War due to their refusal to sell out their friends at the first opportunity, as Tony Stark does here in CIVIL WAR. It's hard to imagine that ANY viewer will side with the Stark Toadie Faction (and if there are any of that ilk, there ought to be some way to compile a list of them for future watch lists and possible sanctions). America's Fatal Flaw is that a majority of its people Worship Money, and view those that hoard the most of it as Gods on Earth. Since Rich People own and control all Media, this sort of weak-minded sinful thinking is promoted in our faces 24\\7\\365. What this world needs is Real Life Captains America able to crush the all-too-actual Tony Starks with their Heavenly Shields!"", ""What impresses me about this movie is how much good was done in a short amount of time for each character. There are really clever time-saving 'tricks' like Tony using the broom to bust open the hatch that caused the Spidey costume to come dangling down. That saved them minutes of precious dialogue; it just cut straight to the point. And during that whole scene in Peter's place, almost every line of dialogue counted toward something important, with just enough 'fluff' to make it sound like a real conversation instead of 'movie dialogue' (the funny asides like 'please move your leg' and 'your ridiculously hot aunt'), etc.The same is true about the scene near the beginning with Tony's holographic 'flashback' . That scene served so many purposes at once - first, it got me caught up in the background story; then, it gave me an insight into Tony's attitudes and regrets concerning his parents; then, when it was shown that it was a therapy technique, it showed me that Tony still has unresolved emotional issues concerning his parents, which then set up the stage for a reveal that causes Tony's later actions.These two previously mentioned scenes took about four or five minutes tops, and many other scenes in the film managed to squeeze in a half-hour's worth of material (per scene) into 5-minute snippets by accomplishing a lot of stuff simultaneously (story-building AND character-building AND plot development) , and making it feel natural and not rushed or forced.This film serves as a great example for others to study when it comes to screenwriting effectiveness. Something really remarkable was done here. And it was very refreshing after seeing so many big-budget blockbusters with horrible screenwriting."", ""In 1991, Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), brainwashed to be the Winter Soldier, causes a car to crash and recovers bags of a serum that turns people into super soldiers.After the Avengers defeated Ultron, Thor and Hulk are nowhere to be found. Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) has gone home to spend time with his family. Even Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) has apparently disengaged. Captain America (Chris Evans) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) are leading a new team of Avengers, consisting of Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), Vision (Paul Bettany), War Machine (Don Cheadle) and Falcon (Anthony Mackie). But the world hasn't forgotten the numerous civilian casualties that resulted from the Avengers' previous missions.In Lagos, Nigeria, the team is tracking the movements of Brock Rumlow (Frank Grillo), a Hydra agent who had infiltrated S.H.I.E.L.D. until Captain America exposed him. Brock was on one of the three Helicarriers that Cap had caused to fire on each other over the Triskelion near Washington DC, and he managed to survive the resulting crash. Badly burned in the incident, he now he wears a skull mask and goes by the name Crossbones. In Lagos, Crossbones and his team of mercenaries ram a garbage truck into the Institute for Infectious Disease building and clear out the guards with smoke canisters. Crossbones uses hydraulic gauntlets to give him super strength, and pounds open the glass around the lab. He grabs a vial containing a deadly, highly contagious virus. Cap's team takes out some of the mercenaries, and Crossbones and the rest of the men make their escape in a truck. After a chase, the truck is taken out of action. Crossbones hands the vial to one of his men, and tells them all to scatter. He then engages Cap, repeatedly punching him with enhanced strength, while the rest of the team chases after the mercenaries. Falcon finds the one holding the vial and shoots him, with Black Widow grabbing the vial before it hits the ground. Cap gets the upper hand on Crossbones, pinning him against the wall. Crossbones tells him that Bucky Barnes remembers him. With Cap momentarily distracted, Crossbones pushes a button, triggering a bomb on his vest. Cap braces himself, but Scarlet Witch is able to contain the force of the explosion. She uses her powers to push it up into the air, but she's only able to elevate it a bit before she loses control, and the explosion rips into the seventh floor of a nearby hotel. Cap calls for fire and rescue, and then runs into the building to help evacuate. Wanda tearfully looks at the destruction, devastated at her misguided actions.In a theater inside Tony Stark's old college, a video plays of him and his parents, Howard (John Slattery) and Maria. At the end, Tony tells the students that he is starting the Howard and Maria Stark Foundation, and each one of them has been approved for a research grant. In a corridor, a woman confronts him and shows him a picture of her son, who had been killed in Sokovia, crushed by a building that the Avengers had knocked down.At the Avengers' headquarters, the team is watching news footage of the Lagos mission. The reporter says that eleven people were killed in the hotel. Steve tells them that he let his guard down, and people died because of it. Vision tells Steve that Tony has arrived, and he brought the Secretary of State as a guest. General Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt) had been involved in the experiment that turned Bruce Banner into the Hulk, and then had spent years trying to hunt him down. Ross tells them that some people look up to them as heroes, but others think they're vigilantes. He shows pictures of the destruction that follows the team wherever they go. Then he sets a thick document down on the table and tells them it's the Sokovia Accords, ratified by 117 countries. The accords state that the Avengers will operate under a panel's supervision, only acting when the panel decides it's necessary. He says there will be a meeting in Vienna in three days, and if they don't sign on, they'll have to retire.The team spends hours debating whether to agree to the accords, and Tony shows them all a picture of the boy who was killed in Sokovia. Steve asks what will happen if there's somewhere they need to go but the panel won't allow them. Tony replies that if they don't agree to this now, it will be forced on them later. Knowing that they've reached a stalemate, Steve leaves in disgust. He gets a message that Peggy Carter has died and attends her funeral in London. At the memorial service, SHIELD Agent 13 (Emily VanCamp) reveals during her eulogy that she's Carter's niece, Sharon. She and Steve share a moment after the service where it's hinted that they are romantically attracted to each other but they need to keep their friendship professional. The next day, Natasha finds Steve and tells him that she, Tony, James Rhodes and Vision had signed on, with Clint and Wanda holding out.In Vienna, several heads of state have gathered for the ratification of the accords. Natasha meets the prince of Wakanda, T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), and his father, King T'Chaka (John Kani). Wakanda had become abundant in vibranium, the material that was used to make Captain America's shield, after a meteorite crashed there. Additionally, some of the Lagos victims were from Wakanda. King T'Chaka takes the podium for the keynote address, and Natasha notices security personnel surrounding a van parked outside. An explosion rips through the building, killing the king.Back in the U.S., Steve is sitting in a hotel room with Sam and Sharon Carter when a news report comes in, showing the destruction in Vienna. Security footage shows the man who planted the bomb, and Steve realizes that it's Bucky. Sharon gets a text, and tells Steve that she has to go to work, and takes a military plane to Vienna. Natasha looks around and sees hundreds of injured people. Prince T'Challa picks up a printed photo showing Bucky leaving the van that had the bomb. Natasha calls Steve, and he tells her that he has to be the one to bring in Bucky. He hangs up and looks at the damaged building, having already arrived in Vienna. Sharon sees him, and she hands him a file so he can get a head start on the manhunt, ahead of a German military task force, GSG9, who have orders to shoot to kill.In Bucharest, Bucky picks up a newspaper and sees that he is being accused of the bombing in Vienna. He realizes that he'll have to leave quickly. Steve goes to Bucky's apartment and finds him there. The GSG9 storm in, and Bucky blocks their bullets with Cap's shield and the two fight them off. He jumps down to the street, where he is confronted by the Black Panther, who scrapes his armor with metal claws on his hands. Cap jumps down and lands next to them, and all three take fire from the GSG9. Cap and Bucky run for cover, but the Black Panther stands still, letting the bullets hit him and bounce off harmlessly. Bucky runs through the streets with Black Panther chasing him, and Cap and Falcon following the Panther. Cap commandeers a GSG9 SUV, while the Panther leaps from the top of one car to the next, steadily gaining on Bucky. Bucky knocks a man off a motorcycle, then jumps on himself and guns the engine, driving into a tunnel. Black Panther is still tirelessly giving chase. Cap drives the SUV near Bucky's motorcycle, and the Panther jumps onto the SUV's roof, and then onto the back of the motorcycle. Bucky swings backward, knocking the Panther off, but he sticks his claws into the side of the SUV and clings to its side. Bucky looks ahead and sees Falcon flying straight toward him. He hits the brakes, and turns the motorcycle around and drives back past the SUV. Cap throws it into reverse, trying to keep up with Bucky. The Panther jumps into the air, and lands on Falcon's wings. Bucky takes a metal ball and throws it up to the roof of the tunnel. It explodes, blowing a hole in the concrete. Falcon uses his wings to shield himself, throwing off the Panther, who went straight through the explosion, unharmed. Bucky swerves to avoid a car, and falls off the bike. The Panther jumps on him, swinging his claws at him. Cap tackles the Panther, and they trade blows, with the Panther's claws leaving gashes in Cap's shield. War Machine flies in through the hole, and the GSG9 surrounds them all and tells them to put their hands up. They are all arrested, and Black Panther removes his mask, revealing himself as Prince T'Challa of Wakanda.On the ride to the task force headquarters in Berlin, Cap tells the prince that he has the wrong man. Cap, Falcon and the prince get out, and in another truck, Bucky is taken out in a cage. They are met by Everett Ross (Martin Freeman), the leader of the headquarters. The men have their weapons removed, and they are led inside the building, where Black Widow is waiting for them. Everett takes Prince T'Challa into one room, and the others are led to another room, where Tony tells them that Secretary Ross wants to have them all prosecuted. Tony says that as a compromise, they won't get back the shield and wings, which are now government property.T'Challa uses his influence to have Bucky extradited to Wakanda, where he will face charges of terrorism. Bucky is given an evaluation to determine his mental state. Still in the room with Tony, Cap watches it unfold. Tony tells him that if he signs the accords now, Bucky will be transferred to an American psych facility instead of a Wakandan jail. Steve agrees, but only if safeguards are put into place. Tony brightens, telling Steve that he and Wanda will be reinstated. Steve asks what he means about Wanda, and he tells Steve that she is being confined to the Avengers' upstate New York facility, under the guard of Vision. Tony says it's the best he can do, since she's not a U.S. citizen and they won't give her a visa. Steve says that she's only a kid, and doesn't deserve to be imprisoned. He leaves without signing onto the accords.Hawkeye breaks into the facility where Vision is holding Scarlet Witch. He attacks Vision, but is unable to hurt him. Scarlet Witch uses her powers to Vision through the floor and down several levels, and she and Hawkeye escape.Colonel Zemo (Daniel Brühl), having already killed a Hydra agent and recovered a book containing a list of words that will trigger Bucky's reversion to his brainwashed state, infiltrates the compound as the psychiatrist who will evaluate Bucky and reads off the list. Bucky, recognizing the trigger list, is helpless to stop Zemo and pounds his way out of his cell, battling Stark, Cap, Natasha and T'Challa. He tries to escape in a helicopter on the roof but is stopped by Rogers, who forces the chopper to fall into the river. He rescues his friend and takes him to a safe house where he and Sam Wilson clamp Bucky's bionic arm in an industrial press. Regaining his senses, Bucky tells Steve that Zemo is going to Siberia, where there are several more super soldiers waiting for someone to wake them up and give them a mission.Cap assembles a team consisting of Bucky, Falcon, Hawkeye, Scarlet Witch and Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) to stop Zemo. By operating outside of authority, they all become renegades. Iron Man forms his own team, made up of War Machine, Black Panther, Black Widow, Vision and Spider-Man (Tom Holland) to arrest the others. Two teams meet at the airport in Stuttgart, Germany. Cap's plan involves stealing the Quinjet some members of the other team arrived in. Stark tries to appeal to Rogers but fails and a pitched battle breaks out. Stark insists that Peter Parker remain at a distance and use his webbing to subdue anyone he can. Black Panther intends to capture Bucky. Ant-Man enlarges himself to 80 feet in height, distracting Stark's team and buying time for Cap and Bucky to escape to an aircraft hangar. Black Widow appears intent on stopping them, but she turns on Black Panther, allowing Cap and Bucky to fly off in the Quinjet. War Machine tries to stop them from escaping, but Falcon flies after him. Tony orders Vision to stop Falcon, Vision shoots an energy beam which Falcon dodges and it hits War Machine instead, causing him to fall from the sky and impact the ground before either Falcon or Stark can reach him. Stark finds that Rhodes is barely alive. When Falcon tries to express his sympathy, Tony knocks him out with a repulsor blast.After seeing evidence that Bucky was framed for the Vienna explosion, Iron Man travels to The Raft, a remote Arctic prison facility where the other members of Cap's team are incarcerated under the supervision of Secretary Ross. Tony is able to temporarily block the audio surveillance system of the facility long enough to show Sam that Rogers was right and that Zemo had killed the psychiatrist who was supposed to evaluate Bucky. He is able to find out from Sam Wilson where Rogers and Bucky went. Tony boards his private chopper and slips out in his Iron Man Armor and heads to Siberia to meet up with Cap and Bucky and make peace.Once Tony finds Bucky and Capt, they find that the super soldiers have already been killed, and Zemo, hidden behind indestructible glass, reveals that his real plan was to find footage of the Winter Soldier's first mission. Black Panther had been following, unseen, and he hears Zemo admit responsibility for the explosion. Zemo shows them a videotape of Bucky causing the car crash, and then murdering the occupants, Howard and Maria Stark, in cold blood.Incensed, Iron Man attacks both Cap and Bucky, and he demands to know if Steve knew what had happened. Steve tells him that he only knew that Hydra was behind his parents' murder. They fight, and Iron Man blasts off Bucky's metal arm. Cap eventually disables Tony's arc reactor, rendering his suit useless. Tony tells him that he doesn't deserve to carry his shield that his father gave to Steve. Steve drops it and leaves with Bucky. Zemo is sitting outside, and Black Panther stands behind him. He tells Black Panther that his family was killed in Zokovia, and he wouldn't stop until he destroyed the Avengers from within. With his success, Zemo tries to commit suicide with a gun, but Black Panther places his hand over the barrel, stopping the bullet, and then apprehends Zemo for judgment.Tony is helping Rhodes with his recovery, giving him robotic leg braces to recover from paralysis. Steve breaks the heroes out of their island prison and they go to Wakanda, where T'Challa gives them asylum. Bucky elects to be put back into cryogenic sleep until they can find a way to cure his brainwashing, so that no one will be able to manipulate him again. Peter Parker is recovering from his injuries at home, and he tries out a new version of the web shooter that Tony gave him. It projects the Spidey signal onto the ceiling.""]"
40,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Doctor Strange,1211837,"[""Saw 'Doctor Strange' (although fairly late perhaps) because of liking the cast a great deal, who can argue with Benedict Cumberbatch and Tilda Swinton, and having liked a lot of what Marvel has done, something that one doesn't see people saying a lot here.'Doctor Strange' is not a perfect film, but to me it was a thoroughly enjoyable one and is one of Marvel's best. Lets begin with the things that from personal opinion didn't quite work. Rachel McAdams does do a good job with what she has, but the character was underused and underwritten. Her screen time, while essential, was not large and her development was sketchy at best. Strange mastering magic does happen too fast, didn't buy how rushed that aspect was, and while there are a lot of fun and witty moments a few jokes felt random and out of place (i.e. Beyoncé).However, the cast are a major asset. Had reservations about McAdams's character but not with her performance. Benedict Cumberbatch really makes the interesting title character his own and knocks it out the park. The standout of the rest of the cast is Tilda Swinton, wonderfully mysterious as the film's most interesting character and played with relish by her.Chiwetel Ejiofor has a charismatic intensity and Benedict Wong has fun and enjoyed his chemistry with Cumberbatch. Do think that the villain Kaecilius could have been explored in more depth, but Mads Mikkelsen is intriguingly menacing.The story, making the most of a great innovative concept, is never dull and is told with absorbing atmosphere, exuberance and very rarely sacrifices coherence or credulity. There are some really interesting ideas here, explored with thought-provoking intelligence. The action excites and thrills, as well as being visually stunning, instead of being drawn out even though quite long the climax is great fun to watch (or at least it was to me).'Doctor Strange's' script has emotion, wit and tension and although he doesn't have the character growth one would like Strange is a well realised character and Cumberbatch has a lot to thank for that. The music score has great intensity, rousing excitement and nuance and Scott Derrickson clearly engaged hugely with the material.Where 'Doctor Strange' is particularly good is in the production values. It's very stylishly shot and edited and handsomely mounted in production design but it's the incredible special effects (particularly jaw-dropping in the climax) that take centre stage.Overall, while not quite finding it a masterpiece of film-making and having a few problems with it 'Doctor Strange' was a thoroughly enjoyable film and among Marvel's best. 8/10 Bethany Cox"", ""One of Marvel Comics great superheroes finally gets his turn at screen immortality. Doctor Strange who has a manner similar to the TV doctor named House is a rather self satisfied and smug individual. He's a genius and he makes sure everyone knows it. But one night he's involved in a serious automobile crash and his physical body fails to heal entirely. He's left with a palsy that makes being a surgeon out of the question unless you mean tree surgery.Benedict Cumberbatch plays Doctor John Strange and like Tyrone Power in The Razor's Edge he goes to the mystic east to find healing with the Ancient One, a gender bending guru played by Tilda Swinton. He learns a lot about the metaphysical nature of the earth and how worlds co- exist in the same space and how some chosen few like he's been chosen are guarding the portals between those worlds. When those worlds are open it can get real messy.There are times where the plot gets a bit vague and I guess you have to have been a Marvel Comics fanatic in order to get a lot of the subtleties in the story. Something I do not claim to be.Doctor Strange did get an Oscar nomination for Visual Effects and we'll no doubt see a sequel if the demand is there and the money is right."", 'The latest Marvel superhero origin tale, this explores the character of Stephen Strange, a neurosurgeon who loses his dexterity in a horrific car accident. He travels to Kathmandu in order to train spiritually in an attempt to fix his broken body, but instead he finds himself joining an order of mystic monks in their battle against a renegade. DOCTOR STRANGE stands out from the overcrowded market thanks to the emphasis on astral projection and spirituality, which I found generally interesting. Cumberbatch is a likeable hero and the supporting cast much better than usual for this kind of film, with Mads Mikkelsen standing out as villain. The film is inevitably dominated by CGI action but it feels fresher here than most, and it generally stays character-focused to keep the viewer involved.', 'New York neurosurgeon Doctor Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) is brilliant and arrogant. His only friend is ex-love ER doctor Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams). He gets into a car wreck damaging his hands. He is told about Jonathan Pangborn (Benjamin Bratt) who recovered from unrecoverable spinal damage. He is directed to Kamar-Taj. He finds The Ancient One (Tilda Swinton) and Master Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor) who teach him about the astral plane and the infinite dimensions. Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen) is a former disciple of the Ancient One and has fallen under the influence of Dormammu of the Dark Dimension.This is the latest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Dr. Strange adds the strange side to the comic book franchise. Cumberbatch fills out the role. Every role is well cast. Even Tilda Swinton seems fitting in the otherworldly role. The CGI is brilliant. It is Inception plus. The battles are compelling without being confusing. Surprisingly, there is also humor. This is a solid addition to the MCU.', 'The cast was the lead motif, in my case, for see this film. It was the first Doctor Strange I saw. I am not fan of Marvel universe - I am too old. east European, the culture of cartoons super-heroes remains too far by me. The second motif was the resurrect of memories about Oriental techniques of spirituality. And, sure, I repeat, the meet of Tilda Swinton, Mads Mikkelsen, Benedict Cumberbatch is a a good prize. I do not know if it is a good or a bad movie. The special effects, like in case of each blockbuster, ignores the answer . It is a firework. Seductive for a precise target. Far to be convincing. Nice. And...chaotic. So many flaws, so beautiful colors . And biology. And a lot of good intentions. A work more by computers . Like so many. But nice. For the work of actors reminding the existence of story.', '""Doctor Strange"" is an American movie that runs for under two hours slightly and was released this year, 2016, very recently actually. The writer and director is Scott Derrickson and after making a handful of films for horror film fans, here he enters the world of superheroes, namely the Marvel Universe. And this will without a doubt turn into Derrickson\'s most known work to-date. No need to mention all the other characters who already got their own films or were in the Avengers movie as you probably are aware of them anyway if you consider seeing this one. Obviously, Marvel is not running short of these and I am sure Doctor Strange will not be the last guy entering the scene. The title character is played by Benedict Cumberbatch and there are more fairly famous names in the cast. You can check out the list to find out who exactly appeared in here. Actually, I myself thought Stuhlbarg\'s character would turn into some kind of antagonist judging from the early scenes but he was just a mean to show the character development towards being a nice guy for Cumberbatch\'s character. Speaking about him, you could call him a mix of Dr. House, Sherlock and a superhero eventually I guess. Other than that, the film also makes parallels to stuff like ""Inception"" or ""Doctor Who"".The way how you see this movie will have a lot to do with how much you like Cumberbatch. I personally think he is a very overrated actor who does not have half as much range as people make him out to have plus his approach to very different characters looks almost always the same. And this movie here is no exception either. Let\'s be honest: The first half hour of the film is Cumberbatch channeling his Sherlock 100%. But away from him and let\'s look a bit at the film in general. Stan Lee has his cameo as usual and the main antagonist is played by Mads Mikkelsen 10 years after he gave another very memorable villain performance in a Bond movie. But sadly, his turn here offers very little in terms of memorability and this has mostly to do with how forgettable and generic the character was written. Mikkelsen still makes the most of it. In terms of the plot, a bit of it is predictable (Swinton\'s character\'s fate e.g.), but not everything. These two hours definitely also have many lighter moments, but there aren\'t many that are working out from a comedy perspective. One exception would be the name confusion between hero and antagonist or Cumberbatch mentioning his astral body. McAdams was part of several of these comedy moments and she definitely elevates the material, but seriously Cumberbatch is so bland and has no comedic talent at all and his always-the-same tongue-in-cheek approach becomes stale and cringeworthy quickly. Most of the scenes intended as somewhat funny to create a balance with the more heavy material aren\'t working.Eventually, this film here is a decent watch for comic book film fans, even if there are many weaknesses included. Still, the story is solid for the most part and some of the scenes and characters are also memorable, even if there was nothing really new or innovative in here that you haven\'t seen in Marvel films in recent years yet. The film also offers some of the best in terms of special effects, but for real film lovers like me it\'s difficult to really appreciate these if the story is a bit flawed. I\'m curious what you think about the film\'s comedy. As for me, I definitely prefer the darker, unfunny approach to superhero films, but this is not the one taken in the Marvel films and this should not come as a surprise to anybody anymore. Besides that, I don\'t think Cumberbatch was ideal for the part. Most of the other actors are though and I am a bit surprised how many English actors are in here. What else can be said? Oh yeah, at the end there is already a bit of a teaser about Strange and Thor working together on a future project and this is probably the next film we can expect where the focus is on Thor, his dad and once again the brute brother Loki. Finally, one more word on this one here. They really tried to make it different compared to other Marvel films with all the intellectual, the doctor, the scientist references, but it\'s not working out. The only effect it had on me was that I was wondering where are the other heroes when the world is in danger. Besides, the time references (and how crucial it was at the end) felt a bit random. Clumsy references to watches just aren\'t enough to make it work in the long run. I see this film has received many strong reviews and receptions so far and I am a bit baffled by that. It is a solid film, but there is not a single aspect that stands out and even if these two hours flew by quickly, I don\'t think it will get people interested in superhero films if they did not like them before already. If the latter is true, however, then you can check it out and I recommend the watch.', ""Marvel takes another risk with making a movie with one of their relatively lesser known characters. Benedict Cumberbatch uses his Sherlock skills to make the egoist Dr Stephen Strange to be likable.He plays a cocky, brilliant neurosurgeon whose hands are shattered after a car crash. He travels to Nepal and to a secretive temple called Kamar-Taj headed by the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton) where he learns mystical skills and magic when he broadens his mind and accepts his part in the multiverse.Marvel Studios gets all trippy with multicoloured Salvador Dali inspired sequences that also owes a lot to Christopher Nolan's Inception of folding cityscapes.The plot is perfunctory though. Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen made up to look like a glam rock star) is a former student of the Ancient One, who believes there can be eternal life and the Celtic Ancient One has been holding out as to her real source of her powers. He makes a pact with an entity from the dark dimension that wants to destroy the planet.There is something Harry Potter like about this film, especially as some of the scenes were filmed in London. There is a nifty sequence with the Cloak of Levitation that has chosen to be with Dr Strange.Solid support from Chiwetel Ejiofor as Mordo who teaches Dr Strange to fight and Benedict Wong as the protector of the ancient books.

But Dr. Strange unsuccessfully spends his savings searching an experimental treatment for his fingers. When Dr. Strange learns that the paraplegic Jonathan Pangborn (Benjamin Bratt) walked again, he seeks him out and he says he was healed in Kamar-taj. Dr. Strange travels to Katmandu where he meets the sorcerer Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and is introduced to The Ancient One (Tilda Swinton).

However, her former protégé Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen) has summoned the powerful demon Dormammu, from the Dark Dimension, and wants to destroy the three Sanctums with his minions to let the Dark Dimension, where time does not exist and anyone can live forever, to rule the world. Will The Ancient One, Dr. Strange and Mordo save the world?""Doctor Strange"" is another entertaining film with another Marvel non- popular hero. The witty story is well developed, presenting Doctor Strange to the audience. The scene where Mordo delivers a piece of paper to Dr. Strange with the wi-fi password is hilarious. The cast is also excellent. But the top-notch special effects are amazing. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Doutor Estranho"" (""Doctor Strange"")', ""Another Marvel film. It doesn't matter how many well regarded subtitled films I have in my queue, or how much I suspect that any given Marvel movie will have the same strengthens and weaknesses as the others I've seen, I will watch these quite quickly when they are available to watch at home. That includes characters I have never heard of before, such as Ant-Man, and this one. The plot here sees a talented surgeon get in an accident, lose full control of his once talented hands, and seek out some power that may be able to cure him. That power turns out to be much more than this, and soon he is fighting pan dimensional forces to protect Earth from destruction.There is plenty here that reminds you that you are part of a massive franchise of films, although to be fair Doctor Strange bares that weight pretty well, and mostly it just focuses on what it is doing and not so much on having a lot of connections to these other characters. Watching it as its own film, there is quite a lot to enjoy. The high-profile cast for instance; they bring a lot of quality even if some of them have little to do, and/or caused controversy by their casting. The special effects are probably the big thing though. Not only are they technically impressive (like almost all big blockbusters) but the nature of them is quite pleasing in the way it twists the world around. They are not enough to carry the film, but they do make a mark. Finally, the light humor works well, and helps it not take itself too seriously.Sadly, outside of the cast and effects, what we have is an origin story for a character I have no reason to be interested in. The effects may be impressive, but they also limit how I could connect to the action. It all plays out with noise and movement, but the familiarity of the content meant I never really got into it. On one hand this is what I come to the marvel films for – so on that front the effects, humor, and noisy action all were present; however, as a total package Strange was only an 'okay' film that could have been much more."", 'Dr. Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) is an expert in movie trivia and part time renown brain surgeon. After an auto accident he loses a lot of use of his hands and travels to Kathmandu where the film turns into an acid trip as Strange enters into a world of word puns, oxymoron, and alternate universes. He is trained by the ancient one (Tilda Swinton) from Narnia...but is now good,...oh wait... yeah okay she is still good. She is training him to combat the dark lord, the Dom in fight a metaphysical battle.The most amazing thing about this film is that they were able to introduce a Marvel character in under three, even two hours. I liked the support cast but felt cheated by Benedict Cumberbatch who didn\'t seemed right for the part. This, coupled with the constant CG acid trip scenes made the film less than what it could have been...at least for me. The dreary ""Omen"" style soundtrack should of had something modern instead, considering Dr. Strange\'s love for rock. The dialogue was remarkably dry. Where is Tony Stark when you need him?', ""The great thing about the Marvel Universe is that they keep mixing it up. I'm someone who's not as aware of all the story lines or heroes that exists. I never read Doctor Strange for example, so I did not know what to expect. And I guess you can say it's the superhero version of Inception. It is definitely something that we haven't seen before in a Superhero movie being done.And the casting is superb too. You know the effects will be great, they have the money to invest in that. If you don't have an aversion against Marvel and/or are a total fanboy of DC (I myself like Batman a lot and yes also the version Ben Affleck is portraying), you will have a lot of fun watching this. There are scenes even after the movie is over. By now everyone should know that ... and yet still some leave or stop the movie when the credits start to roll"", 'The trailer for the movie that I saw says it\'s like nothing you\'ve ever seen before. I think that was a pretty good description, as the special effects are nothing short of astounding, and I\'m sure worthy enough for Oscar consideration in that area. That might be the best reason to catch this flick, although Benedict Cumberbatch is excellent in the role of the title character. This is one comic book I never read as a kid, so of all the Marvel movies that I\'ve caught, and I think it might be all of them, this is one I came in on cold and I wasn\'t disappointed.The movie in fact turns a lot of typical super-hero conventions on their head. There\'s a reference to The Avengers in the story as a team that protects the physical world, while Doctor Strange\'s mission will be deemed as protector of the metaphysical one. One will have to simply take it on faith that the story line\'s treatment of astral projection, temporal manipulation and mirror dimensions can be translated into the real world, so accepting all that will be key to enjoying the story. For the most part I did, though that whole business with Strange challenging Romomu in the time loop dimension seemed to me a little forced.As an origin story for Doctor Strange, I thought the narrative was pretty effective, forcing Stephen Strange to face the unconventional in the treatment of his physical condition following the accident. He starts out as this really arrogant guy who\'s stuck on himself as much as he\'s stuck on science, and it takes the combined effort of The Ancient One (Tilda Swinton), Mordo (Chiwetel Ojiofor) and Wong (Benedict Wong) to bring him over to a multi-dimensional way of pursuing knowledge. If there\'s a downside to the story, It may be that Strange put it all together just a bit too quickly, but given the challenge of fitting things into a two hour movie, I guess we can excuse the rush job.In my theater at least, it appeared that most viewers are now conditioned to hang around for the after-film previews of coming surprises in the Marvel Universe. This one actually had a couple, with a tease of a Dr. Strange/Thor hook-up that makes sense in terms of off planet adventure, while the second one suggested a future confrontation between Strange and his former mentor Mordo. Either way, we haven\'t seen the last of Doctor Stephen Strange.Oh, almost forgot - Stan Lee is in this one, just like he is in almost all the movies of Marvel characters he helped create. I\'ll have to go back for a second look because he comes on screen as a truck driver saying ""That is hilarious"", in a scene that didn\'t seem to connect with what was going on at the time. And there was a lot going on at the time.', 'While on a journey of physical and spiritual healing, a brilliant neurosurgeon (Benedict Cumberbatch) is drawn into the world of the mystic arts.One of the biggest problems with the Marvel film series is how clogged up they get and how hard it is to keep the plots and subplots straight. This is also their strength, as it ensures that people will keep watching the next entry. With ""Doctor Strange"", we avoid that issue altogether... even though we get vague references to the other films in the series, you do not need to know what an ""infinity stone"" is to appreciate the movie.The character of Strange is a good one and not your typical hero. Personally, I found the effects to be over-the-top, as they are in many of the Marvel films. But the ""Inception"" look aside, the plot is certainly unique. Seeing how Strange is used in the future, as he is not often connected to the Avengers in the comics, will be interesting. Perhaps this will open the door for Moon Knight or some other supporting character?', ""The trailer for this next entry of superheroes into the Marvel universe looked fantastic, and the critics gave it the full five out of five stars, so I definitely wasn't going to miss out, directed by Scott Derrickson (Hellraiser: Inferno, The Exorcism of Emily Rose, The Day the Earth Stood Still, Sinister). Basically in Kathmandu, Nepal, the sorcerer Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen) and his zealots have entered the secret compound Kamar-Taj, which contains ancient and mystical texts, murdered the librarian, and stolen a ritual from a book belonging to sorcerer the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton), he is able to escape with some of his followers. Dr. Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) is an arrogant but highly qualified and acclaimed neurosurgeon, until he has a horrific car accident, he loses the use of his hands, his colleague and former lover Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams) wants to help him move on, but Strange believes he can find a way to regain the use of his hands. Strange has become vain using all his resources to pursue experimental surgeries and healing processes, all without success, then he learns about Jonathan Pangborn (Benjamin Bratt), a paraplegic who mysteriously regained the ability to walk, he seeks out and is directed to Kamar-Taj. There Strange is taken in by sorcerer Karl Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor), the Ancient One was his teacher, she meets Strange and shows him her power, the astral plane and other dimensions, including the Mirror Dimension, he begs her to teach him, she eventually agrees, despite being reminded of her former student Kaecilius, who was also arrogant. Under the Ancient One and Mordo, Strange begins his tutelage, learning from ancient books in the library, now presided over by the master Wong (Benedict Wong). Strange learns Earth is protected from other dimensions by a spell formed from three buildings called Sanctums, in New York City, London and Hong Kong, the sorcerers are tasked with protecting them, but Pangborn gave up the responsibility and channelled mystical energy into walking again. Over several months Strange has advanced quickly, even secretly reading the text stolen by Kaecilius, revealed to be The Book of Cagliostro, and learning to bend time with mystical Eye of Agamotto, Mondo and Wong warn Strange against breaking the laws of nature, comparing his arrogance and yearning for power to Kaecilius. Kaecilius and his followers use the stolen pages to summon the powerful Dormammu of the Dark Dimension, where time does not exist and all can live forever, the London Sanctum is destroyed, Strange is sent to the New York Sanctum, zealots attack, Strange holds them off with the mystical Cloak of Levitation. Mordo and the Ancient One arrive, but Strange and Mordo are disillusioned when Kaecilius reveals that the Ancient One has used Dormammu's power to preserve her long life, she is mortally wounded by Kaecilius before he escapes to Hong Kong, the Ancient One tells Strange he will have to break the rules to stop the destruction, she then dies, despite the efforts of Strange and a bewildered Palmer. Arriving in Hong Kong, Strange Mondo find Wong dead and the Sanctum destroyed, and the Dark Dimension has already engulfed Earth, Strange uses the Eye to reverse time to save the Sanctum and Wong, he then travels to the Dark Dimension to confront Dormammu. Strange tries to bargain with Dormammu to end his destruction of Earth, but the evil entity kills him, however the same moment repeats, Strange reveals he has placed himself and Dormammu in an infinite time loop, they will trapped forever until he agrees to a bargain, eventually after various repeats, and Strange killed various times, Dormammu is told the time loop will end he leaves Earth, taking Kaecilius and the zealots with him. In the end Dormammu and his forces depart, Mordo also departs, disgusted by Strange and the Ancient One's disregard for the consequences of defying nature, Strange returns the Eye, also known as the Infinity Stone, then takes residence at the New York Sanctum to continue his studies. During the credits, Strange is seen meeting with Thor (Chris Hemsworth), who has brought Loki to Earth to search for their father Odin, Strange agrees to help with the search; after the credits Mordo visits Pangborn and steals his energy used for walking, stating Earth has too many sorcerers. Also starring Michael Stuhlbarg as Dr. Nicodemus West, Scott Adkins as Lucian / Strong Zealot, Meera Syal as Dr. Patel and Stan Lee as Man on Bus. Cumberbatch is the perfect choice as the leading superhero who has the career-ending accident but then becomes a powerful time travelling and wielding mystical energy, supporting cast members Swinton, Ejiofor, Mikkelsen and Wong are suited to their parts as well. This works as a fantastic origins story for the hero with the recognisable name and costume, the story is enthralling and has plenty of exciting action sequences, there are good moments of humour, but more than anything it is an excellent display of visually stunning special effects to bring superpower abilities to life and see skyscrapers and cities being rotated and turned inside out, a superb fantasy adventure and superhero movie. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Production Design, Best Make Up/Hair and Best Special Visual Effects. Very good!"", 'This was definitely a comic book story long in the waiting for a transition to the big screen, and I am sure that many fans of the comic book and the Marvel universe were thrilled with this movie. I, however, am not a fan of superheroes in any shape or form, and just watched this movie because I had a chance to do so with my wife.Once the movie ended and the sparks and flashing effects left my eyes with a proper sight again, I can in all honesty say that this was a shallow and pointless movie, and there were so many plot holes that even a Swizz cheese would be jealous. But luckily enough there was so many grand and amazing effects on the screen to divert your attention from all the plot holes and the lack of a proper thought-through storyline.Personally I am not overly much a fan of Benedict Cumberbatch, and I don\'t really get the hype around him. He is not all that impressive. And one would think that I would be thrilled about seeing Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen in this movie, but I wasn\'t. He was just browsing through this as if he had seen through all the flaws and shortcomings that the script had.And with my lack of interest in superhero movies, then ""Dr. Strange"" is a movie that just came and went without leaving any impression or lasting mark, unlike ""Logan"" for example. And it is definitely not a movie that I will pick up again and sit down to watch. Why? Because the story just barely had enough contents to support the first viewing.Instead of just spewing out superhero movies by the dozen, Marvel Studios should take the time to get some proper script writers to pen out the stories for the movies they want to put on the big screen.Even though ""Dr. Strange"" was heavily loaded with special effects, it was just a shallow experience of a movie all in all. As such, my rating of this 2016 addition to the Marvel movie universe is a mere mediocre 5 out of 10 stars, based mostly on the special effects.', ""I was reasonably entertained by Doctor Strange despite not fully following the plot; my enjoyment was largely thanks to the sheer spectacle of the whole thing, the film featuring several jaw-dropping set-pieces that make the absolute most of modern digital technology.

He is advised to go to a place in India to be healed, since modern medicine can do nothing. There he meets the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton) who introduces him to the magical arts and tells him that he can heal himself.

The film goes by very quickly. The cast is top notch, with Chiwetel Ejiofor, Benedict Wong, and Rachel Adams along with those mentioned above. One word of caution - in order to see the whole film, you need to stay through the entire credits to the end, as there is a scene during the credits, and then at the end of the credits, there is another scene. This one is critical and sets up the next installment.British actors come over here to make money, and I can't criticize Cumberbatch for taking on this franchise. Is it the way I would have gone with his career? No. I would have preferred him to go the Eddie Redmayne or Sir Anthony Hopkins route, and I frankly don't understand some of his film choices. I suppose they were all part of a build-up, but why appear in Black Mass in a supporting role and Zoolander 2?His television work has been exemplary and more along classical lines; he has formed a production company, so let's hope the material matches the abilities of this man's talent.Anyway, see Dr. Strange.

But Why Quibble.Suffice to Say that Stan Lee and Steve Ditko Created the Character as a Third String Filler in the Comics of the 1960\'s and it Immediately Found a Niche that didn\'t Fold into the Marvel Universe, it Shined on its Own.

Another Winner for Marvel Studios.The Movies Capture what\'s Best about Comics and these Films Show No Signs of Coasting. If Anything, the Comic Book Movie is Improving and the Creative Process from the Artists Involved is Indefatigable.', '""Dr. Strange"" ranks as the best Walt Disney Studios and Marvel Comics\' collaboration since ""Iron Man."" Mind you, I\'ve confined myself strictly to the Disney/Marvel franchise and excluded the Marvel Comics/Twentieth Century Fox franchises: ""X-Men,"" ""Deadpool,"" and ""Daredevil."" Not only is director Scott Derrickson\'s sixth movie a dazzling example of bizarre superhero histrionics, but it also qualifies as a splendid origins epic in every respect. Wisely, Derrickson confines this supernatural masterpiece to 115 minutes without slighting any character or leaving any threads undone in its formulaic template. Benedict Cumberbatch is truly a revelation as Dr. Steven Strange, and his character follows quite an arc before the film concludes. Audiences should know that ""Dr. Strange"" has two scenes before and after the end credits that are essential to the film. Steven Strange possesses an abrasive attitude, and ""Dr. Strange"" adheres to the Disney/Marvel formula that originated with ""Iron Man."" Dr. Strange is just as arrogant as Tony Stark. These two prima donnas begin as ordinary humans with extraordinary gifts before hubris and bad luck combine to topple them from affluence. Similarly, they recover from these seemingly insurmountable ordeals with the incentive of a powerful mentor and emerge as larger-than-life titans. Unlike the colossal collateral damage that has highlighted virtually every Disney/Marvel movie to date, ""Dr. Strange"" embraces an alternate strategy. This movie eschews the real world and lapses more often into the imaginary realm. The heroes don\'t destroy cities in their efforts to subjugate the villains as they have usually done in previous Disney/Marvel extravaganzas. Furthermore, Derrickson channels ""The Matrix"" in the depiction of Dr. Strange\'s makeover as he learns about how to exist in different dimensions. Meantime, in its biggest departure from the Marvel comic book series, Derrickson and company have broken a tradition. They have cast Oscar winning actress Tilda Swinton as The Ancient One who introduces Strange to the wondrous mysteries of the mind. In the comics, the Ancient One was a guy rather than a girl. ""Dr. Strange"" serves not only as a sensational Marvel Comics adaptation but also as commentary on a national epidemic of distracted driving that has swept the country since the advent of cell phones. Protagonist Dr. Stephen Strange (Oscar nominated actor Benedict Cumberbatch of ""The Imitation Game"") is an eminent, world-renowned surgeon who has achieved unparalleled feats with his hands. As he is searching for his next surgical triumph, Strange is careening along a swerving mountain-side highway without a care in the world. He has his phone switched on in his sleek sports car and it debating to accept a new patient when he loses control of his vehicle, smashes into another car, and flies off the highway like a UFO, and crashes miles below in obscurity. When he awakens after surgery, he finds his hands permanently mangled. Repeated surgeries gain him nothing, and gifted surgeons like he once was refuse to take his case for fear of ruining their track records. Eventually, Strange spends so much money than he loses virtually everything he had acquired, and he loses the woman that he loved the most, Dr. Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams of ""The Vow""), who refuses to have anything to do with her after he insults her. Later, during his rehab, Strange alienates his rehab therapist. The therapist tells Strange about a similar man, Jonathan Pangborn (Benjamin Pratt of ""The Infiltrator""), who triumphed over his limitations. Strange is shocked to learn that this patient recovered from an impossible spinal injury that nobody has conquered. Desperate to know how Pangborn accomplished this unheard-of feat, Strange accepts Pangborn\'s advice and travels to a monastery in Nepal. Strange blows the rest of his dwindling funds and approaches the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton) in the mountains. She shows him familiar pictures of the human body, and Strange accuses her of being a quack until she knocks him out of his body into an entirely different dimension. Performing an about-face, Strange humbles himself before her as he plumbs the depths of his mind that he never thought probable. Although he never recovers his long-sought after manual dexterity, he becomes a different person who can alter time and space. Little does he realize that the mystical world that he has entered has been traveled by others who endeavor to exploit their new-found power to destroy the world. Along the way, he establishes his identity as Dr. Strange, not as Mr. Strange or Master Strange. Like all memorable Marvel movies, ""Dr. Strange"" sacrifices the life of one of its primary characters to endow the film with a sense of depth. ""Sinister"" director Derrickson, ""Prometheus"" scribe Jon Spaihts, and ""Sinister"" franchise writer C. Robert Cargill have created a thoroughly entertaining film fraught with nuance and detail. The villains are smart, strong, and resourceful adversaries that look truly malevolent. The villains are interesting but never sympathetic, and ""Casino Royale"" villain Mads Mikkelsen is perfectly cast as the leader. The titular hero must endure trial after trial before he acquires his unique powers as Dr. Strange. Like any worthwhile superhero saga, ""Dr. Strange"" puts the fate of the world at stake, and our resilient hero must contend with enemies far more formidable than he until he masters his skills as a sorcerer and defeats them. Derrickson and his writers have forged believable, sympathetic characters that we care about. ""Dr. Strange"" amounts to an enjoyable load of hokum embellished with mind-boggling visuals. When the heroes and villains tangle, they create worlds within worlds to stage their Armageddon-style showdowns without endangering the rest of humanity. The sight of cityscapes folding up like accordions is nothing short of spectacular. If you\'ve seen the Leonardo DiCaprio thriller ""Inception,"" the sprawling cityscapes behave in similar fashion as our heroes battle to control the arena with the bad guys. You may figure out who decides to give up their life to ensure the safety of future generations. Provocatively, fadeout at the end doesn\'t necessarily guarantee the triumph of good over evil.', ""Dr. Steven Strange is a brilliant neurosurgeon. He is at the peak of his career when a car accident leaves him with nerve damage in his hands, and unable to continue his career. He tries everything to remedy the situation, but nothing works. In desperation he travels to Kathmandu, Nepal, to seek the an organisation known as Kamar-Taj. What he finds goes beyond healing, or the physical world.Initially, quite interesting. The Dr Strange backstory was an engaging one and made you think that this movie could be different to all those other adaptations of comic book characters.Sadly, it was not to be. From a point the mystical narrative comes into play, which is just an excuse for the director to show off his CGI skills. From then on it's just your usual style-over-substance comic book vapidity."", '. . . (which comes AFTER ""all"" the closing credits) will learn that it\'s now Open Season on Harry Potter & Friends. When Mordo attacks Pangborn, he mutters ""The world has too many wizards."" This is a dead giveaway that Disney MegaBlobCorp intends on forcing AT&T to spin off Master Potter\'s Warner Bros. Studio to the House of Louse as the price of regulatory approval for AT&T\'s acquisition of Time Warner. That way, the D-Blob will swallow up Warner\'s Potter Properties, just as they devoured Pixar, the Muppets, ESPN, ABC, Marvel Studios, and Star Wars. Anytime now we can expect a flick to hit the Big Screens in which Mordo sets his sights on Harry, Ron, and Hermione in the Disney Multiverse.

Perhaps the Disney Blob will release what amounts to a gooey glob, but it cannot be much cheesier than the psychedelic Outer Space DOCTOR STRANGE spin on GROUNDHOG DAY. (Would you like some spaghetti with your multicolored meatballs, Doc?) By ripping bits and pieces from both good movies (INCEPTION) and bombs (THE LAST AIRBENDER), at least DOCTOR STRANGE is an Equal Opportunity target for copyright infringement lawsuits.', 'Rockstar neurosurgeon mister, sorry, doctor, Stephen Strange(perfectly cast Cumberbatch, embodying both the early arrogance and the mature respect) comes out of a car crash with his hands as destroyed as a PG-13 rating will allow. Western medicine simply can\'t do more than it has. So he finds himself in Kathmandu, in a temple, finding out that magic is real, as well as a huge world of its own. As he becomes more familiar with it, so do we, without it ever losing the ""wow"" factor. By the climax, when numerous different kinds of powers are wielded on both sides, we understand the core rules of every single one. This sets a new standard for how well-handled and, yes, accessible, a big budget fantasy tale can be, even if it\'s not a household name. It\'s not always that self-assured. Friend, not love, Christine(McAdams, sweet, charming, and actually a presence in spite of the limited screen time) is essentially nothing more than a studio note that ends in an underlined ""if not, it gets too weird"". This borrows from The Matrix, Inception, and the continually expanding and exciting(we will see Benedict again *very* soon!) MCU\'s most played card, Iron Man. But it makes it all work.They couldn\'t have picked a better hand than Derrickson\'s. He handles the action incredibly well. Yes, as an origin story, the middle doesn\'t have a lot, and the opening is fairly brief, giving us a taste of what we\'ll later bathe in. On the whole, it is plentiful, no sequence is ever so short it doesn\'t properly register, it looks and feels like nothing we\'ve seen before, even if it has pieces that are recognizable. A gritty reality being invaded by increasingly strong supernatural forces – and the fact that he did Sinister, as well, is evident in some gruesome material. I can just hear the pitch now, opening as I\'m sure it did with ""the film will just about open with a brutal accident so bad that it leaves the lead partially handicapped for most of it"".The door has been opened. The multiverse is upon us. It\'s glorious. Colorful, with tremendous depth(watch it in 3D!), unforgettable, psychedelic, amazing.

His minions restrain the librarian/guardian with bands of energy. Kaecilius uses two large knives to decapitate the man and escapes with the help of several followers. The owner of the book, the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton), goes after them. As he flees, Kaecilius bends, folds, and reshapes the streets and buildings of the city (think Inception (2010), but more kaleidoscopic). Though she's a formidable magical fighter, the Ancient One is unable to pin down Kaecilius and he escapes.In New York City, renowned surgeon Dr. Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) is cool and confident as he performs a delicate brain operation at Metro-General Hospital. As he finishes, his ex-girlfriend Dr. Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams) rushes in to show him an x-ray of a patient with a bullet in his brain. He immediately dismisses the case as hopeless but with further prodding from Christine, he realizes that the patient is comatose because his medulla oblongata has been poisoned by trace elements in the bullet. Strange realizes he can save the man's life and goes to the ER surgery and quickly does a manual extraction with forceps, demonstrating his impressive hand control. The doctor who made the initial diagnosis, Nicodemus West (Michael Stuhlbarg) is left humiliated by Strange's overwhelming ego. Later, Strange and Christine joke about their on-again, off-again relationship. She turns down his request to join him that evening.Strange dresses for the evening in his expensive condo, pausing to choose from a drawer full of high-end watches. Speeding out of his condo in his Lamborghini Huracán, Strange heads north. He calls an assistant to consider his next patients; he's in high demand but he wants only difficult, interesting cases. Distracted and driving recklessly, he crashes and the car plunges into the river. As his car is wrecked, his hands slam into the dashboard.He is airlifted back to his hospital and Christine is there when he awakens, badly hurt. His hands have had to be rebuilt and are immobilized in a framework of pins and wires. Recovering slowly after further surgeries, his hands remain stiff and shaky -- he can no longer work as a neurosurgeon. Feeling sorry for himself, Strange breaks up with Christine. He hears about a man called Jonathan Pangborn (Benjamin Bratt) who, inexplicably, recovered from a half-body paralysis. Strange finds Pangborn playing basketball and the man tells him he found the cure in Kamar-Taj.Strange travels Nepal and wanders the streets of Kathmandu. He is noticed and followed. Another sorcerer, Karl Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor), saves him from muggers and takes him to Kamar-Taj, where he meets the Ancient One.The Ancient One knows all about Strange and introduces him to an alternate reality where many hidden universes and dimensions can be harnessed for power and mystical guidance. He begins training and slowly learns to open gates to jump across the world. He learns the temple is part of a secret group saving the world from enemies in other dimensions and universes. While training, Mordo shows Strange a magic stick, a relic that can be used as a weapon and says relics must choose their user. He explains that Kaecilius, a former student of the Ancient One, has stolen a spell from a book and escaped with three zealots; there is worry he will decipher the spell and call in Dormammu from the Dark Dimension to take over the world. Strange is upset and says he hasn't come to join their group, only to cure his hands.Strange visits Kamar-Taj's library, which is kept by Wong (Benedict Wong). Strange becomes a voracious student, borrowing and reading many books from the humorless Wong. When he asks about the book that Kaecilius was after, Wong explains that it's reserved for use only by the Sorcerer Supreme and it's the one that Kaecilius stole pages from. When Strange masters creating portals, he steals more books from the library and learns about astral projection. One night when Wong appears to be out of the library, Strange learns how to use a time-shifting pendant, the Eye of Agamotto, which enables him to see the missing page from the book. Mordo and Wong tell him it is forbidden to use time spells as they can cause time loops that a wielder can be stuck in forever and also let evil forces into their universe.Wong explains that are three Sanctums, in London, New York, and Hong Kong, where the group watches out for the world. He also gives more of Dormammu's history, that he is a purely evil being bent on conquering all the known worlds and that Earth has long been his ultimate target.Kaecilius finally deciphers the stolen spell and his group attacks the London Sanctum, a plain building with a logo window. The backlash from the London Sanctum throws Strange through a door and into the New York Sanctum. The building is deserted as he wanders the floors looking at various artifacts. He notices a burgundy cloak in a glass case that moves as he looks at it. At the end of a corridor he finds three glass doors that turn out to be gateways to other places; the destination is changed by turning a dial next to each door.Kaecilius and his group next attack the New York Sanctum. Strange develops fighting skills on the fly. He gets rid of two zealots using the gateways and the burgundy cloak, a relic which seems to have some intelligence and wraps itself around him. The cloak helps him subdue the third zealot and restrain Kaecilius in an antique binding rack. Strange and Kaecilius have a talk about the Ancient One and immortality, in which Kaecilius claims that the Ancient One has achieved her long life using powers from the Dark Dimension. Once Strange lets down his guard, the third zealot revives and stabs him. Strange manages to open a gate and stagger into a janitor's closet in Christine's hospital. He finds her and barely manages to get on a table as Christine hooks him up to a heart monitor and performs and emergency pericardiocentesis to drain excess blood from around his heart. Meanwhile, Strange separates his astral body and continues to fight the zealot, finally killing him with the help of Christine, who shocks him with a defibrillator, killing the zealot. The zealot isn't visible to Christine, but she can tell something is going on and she's very spooked. Sewn up and recovering, Strange tells Christine he must return and goes back through the gate.Kaecilius has escaped and Mordo joins Strange in New York. The Ancient One also comes and suggests Strange take over the New York Sanctum. They're impressed the magical cape, known as the Cloak of Levitation, has chosen him. However, Strange is reluctant to take the position until they tell him more about Kaecilius and also about the Ancient One's use of dark magic to prolong her life.Kaecilius returns with more zealots and Strange creates a Mirror Dimension to contain the fight, which spills out into the street. Kaecilius uses his powers to shape-shift the city (as he did in the opening scene when he fought the Ancient One) and disorient Strange. The Ancient One returns to help but she falls and is mortally wounded. Strange takes her to Christine's hospital but it is too late. Strange follows the Ancient One's spirit in his astral form and they talk overlooking New York City. She accepts this is her end and suggests Strange can take over.Back in the New York Sanctum, Strange and Mordo realize Hong Kong is next on Kaecilius' list. They gate over but the Hong Kong Sanctum has been overrun and the destructive force is enveloping the city. Wong, who was guarding it, has been killed and Dormammu's Dark Dimension is growing from the location of the Sanctum. Strange uses the Eye of Agamotto to start reversing the process, but Kaecilius recovers and manages to stun Strange, stopping the process before it can complete. Strange thinks of something and flies off into the heart of the Dormammu's Dark Dimension. Here, he confronts Dormammu and manages to create an infinite time loop: Dormammu kills Strange in various ways, but every time Strange dies, time is always reset to the start of the confrontation. Dormammu is furious but finally agrees to leave Earth alone in return for Strange stopping the time loop. Back on the street, Strange sends Kaecilius and his crew into the Dark Dimension just before it vanishes.Mordo is upset that Strange broke the rules in using the time pendant and that the Ancient One used what he considers to be forbidden powers to prolong her life. Before she died, the Ancient One warned Strange that Mordo was very big on following the rules -- both his weakness and his strength -- and that Strange's flexibility would be an important factor when they worked together. But Mordo says there must be a reckoning and he retires from the group and walks away.Strange takes over the New York Sanctum. He puts the Eye of Agamotto back in its guarded place at Kamar-Taj, where Wong tells him a little extra secret about the Eye, which is that it contains one of the six Infinity Stones.In a mid-credits scene, Strange decides to help Thor, who has brought his brother Loki to Earth to search for their father, Odin.In a post-credits scene, Mordo visits Pangborn and strips him of the magic he uses to walk. Pangborn collapses in a heap as Mordo coldly states that the problem is too many sorcerers on Earth.""]"
41,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,3896198,"[""Despite being a huge comic book nerd I was not familiar with the Guardians before the first movie came out. I did some googling and upon learning about this sci-fi superhero team consisting of a talking raccoon and tree man I was hardly impressed.I finally got round to watching the first film and was blown away. It had a remarkable charm that even the other Marvel titles didn't have. It was filled with great humour, memorable moments and fit into the Marvel Universe long running story perfectly.Because of this I pumped by expectations up high for the sequel to a degree where it was almost guaranteed to fail yet somehow, someway it didn't.Not only did it meet my expectations but it exceeded them, GotG2 is amazing.Full of the same five star humour, being a visual treat and once again with an excellent soundtrack the film gripped me from the outset and delivered that charm all over again.This time including several industry veterans including Kurt Russell (Who has been on great form since his return) and Sylvester Stallone they fit in well and don't detract from the franchise as I feared they might.With cameo appearances along the way from the likes of Farscape (1999) lead Ben Browder to industry legend Seth Green as Howard the Duck this is a fun rollercoaster ride than left me positively gagging for more.This is one of those films I feel like I could rant about (In a positive way) for a while and so I'm going to resist the urge and merely say that Guardians 2 is a contender for the best Marvel movie, contested only by the first Avengers film.Masterpiece.The Good:Cast are great againCharm returnsExcellent nostalgic soundtrackLooks amazingThe Bad:Only one movie with Baby Groot? Noooo!They seem to have dropped Drax's taking everything literal jokes awayMichael Rosenbaum was wastedThings I Learnt From This Movie:Batista should have skipped over wrestling and just been an actor"", ""Quill finds his real father.This is an enjoyable adventure with great humour and character moments.The story is pretty threadbare outside of the development of characters like Quill, Yondu, Ego, and Nebula but this provides enough entertainment on its own. Written into most scenes are strong themes about family and friendship. What it means to be a parent. Surrogate parents and families. Estranged children searching for parental figures and family.Of course it's all done with a great sense of humour, as characters like Drax, Mantis, Rocket, and Groot light up the screen with strong verbal and visual comedy.Quill doesn't massively develop as a character, but we do learn more about his origins and powers. Alongside this the Guardians are portrayed as developing a family dynamic. This is great idea given they are all depicted as coming from traumatic beginnings.Ego is an interesting character and fantastic visualisation of an outlandish graphic-novel concept. It is not particularly subtle, but the character epitomises an extreme version of the in-built selfish drives present in everyone. Kurt Russell is on great form.The contrasting father figure of Yondu is written particularly well. He has been portrayed as having egotistical characteristics too, but here is given a huge redemption arc with with moments of great altruism. It is great to see Michael Rooker playing this type of character. He is as stereotypically violent and generally aggressive as in his previous roles, but for once he gets to show some heart.Nebula and Gamora have solid moments of relationship development. These scenes all tie in well to the movie's main themes and are important to the overarching narrative of the MCU, particularly when watching The Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame. Karen Gillan and Zoe Zaldana both give strong performances, especially Gillan who is a consistently strong performer in the MCU.Visually it is a colourful feast for the eyes and full of exciting spectacle as you would expect from a space adventure. For me the CGI action is a little too much on occasions and distracts from the story, but doesn't spoil my enjoyment of the movie. It generally tells the story through its cinematography and editing. Being a Guardians movie it has a great soundtrack of course with many a well placed song."", 'My god, I did not expect this movie to be this good. I am a big fan of the first Guardians of the Galaxy movie, and while I do think it is one of the better MCU movies, this one is just better in practically every way. The plot is well structured, and the pacing is great. The movie also explores its characters way more thoroughly than the previous one. The struggle of finding a place where you belong is a central theme, and every important character has their own struggles related to this. The performances are great as usual, every actor really brings their own flavor to their character. The movie also has great visuals, with all the wacky and fun ideas you might expect from a space movie. The action scenes are great, and the cgi is pretty flawless. The movie is also way funnier than any other MCU movie, with every character being a great source of humor. It\'s so much comedy being presented it\'s actually a little too much for me sometimes. Some of the characters feel like they exist only to be comic relief, even though they also have serious struggles that deserve a more serious treatment than they get. That is my only complaint though, as this is a movie with great plot, characters and visuals, as well as a fantastic climax, even though they pulled the whole ""saving the world""-plot point again. This is one of my favorite MCU movies and space movies in general, it\'s a great time and I highly recommend it.', ""The movie is full of heart , well directed and has some great messages as the first one but it is funnier than its predecessor. This can be sometimes an advantage and other times a disadvantage. Not quite as fresh as the original, but it's still a great triumph with one of the most emotionally impactful endings of any Marvel Cinematic Universe story. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 might not be as amazing as the first movie but it's a fun ride with characters we love.Rating: 7,9."", ""It has its moments where it may crack a joke at the wrong time- but Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is easily one of the best sequels i've ever seen- and without a doubt- an absolute blast. I knew from the minute I saw the trailer for the first film that Guardians of the Galaxy was going to be something special, and the same thing applies to this film. We get the iconic characters back in all their glory, as well as some new ones. The entire cast is great, there is no doubting any of the main 5's performances, as they are simply as great as before. What I do enjoy about this film is how they decided to make Nebula less of a 2D character and really provide the depth they didn't have time for her character in the first film. We also get an excellent performance from Kurt Russell as the God Ego- as well as newcomer Pom Klementieff's hilarious portrayal of Mantis, and of course the brilliant Michael Rooker as Yondu. The soundtrack is great, obviously, and Gunn's direction is so excellently crafted and visually sound that you can't help but feel every aspect of emotion he is going for while making it. It's an incredibly funny film, with some great action scenes, and a deeply emotional turmoil that honestly made me cry once...or twice. The visuals are also fantastic, as well as the makeup, and the look of the film is incredibly well developed- as well as its style and atmosphere. In the end, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is everything you would hope the sequel would be and more. It may not be quite as good as the original, but it certainly is more than a worthy successor.My Rating: 9.9/10."", ""3 hour movies are usually too long. (Some movies are too long at any length). This movie seemed too short. The whole film is fun to watch. Most of the pacing, the story and the dialogue are excellent. The humor is actually funny and the characters, which were introduced in the first GG film, continue to be dynamic in this sequel. I actually cared about the characters. I especially liked Michael Rooker's An-du character, and his admission that he loves Quill like a son. Actually, the only ones who don't get a happy ending are the Cree & Ego. Great special effects too. 👍🏻👍🏻"", 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is everything the audience could have hoped for. The same comedic atmosphere is applied, assisting the twists and turns that the plot employs. All the while, the emotional depth of the storyline is perfectly meaningful and helps set out the various messages of the film. The visual effects are yet again stunning and the fight scenes deliver. The movie capitalizes on another amazing soundtrack to accompany its wacky group of characters, whose respective cast members do extremely well giving life to.', 'As does John Crichton, who is playing the Sovereign ""Admiral""- complete with ""Peacekeeper"" NZ style accent. Peacekeepers were not gold, though.But one could make an argument that Peter Quill is a kind of John Crichton, and that Gamora is a type of Aeryn Sun (Gamora, like Aeryn, can lift up heavy objects with no problems at all). Peter Quill is an earthling who was snatched up by aliens, actually by Yondo, in much the same way John Crichton was sucked down a wormhole. So in some ways Peter is as out of place as John was during the 88 times we got to see him in the uncharted and tormented territories of space.We could even say that Drax is a stupider Ka D\'argo and that Rocket is an equally funny Rygel, except that he is a raccoon rather than a helium-farting frog.Yondo can even be a Scorpius, Mantis a Chiana that is attracted to Drax/D\'argo, Nebula a Jool or Shikozou.However you mix it up, the characters and the stories and the comedy is so much like Farscape. Actually come to think about it at the end of ""the peacekeeper wars"" which was the end of the Farscape franchise, John Crichton\'s Best friend is lost. Something similar to that happens in this film, and that just solidifies the relationship between the two franchises.It almost makes us want to see a Farscape sequel or a continuation produced by James Gunn because we know he would handle the property properly.As far as the freakin guardians of the galaxy (except I didn\'t say freakin\'), this installment has so much more in it compared to the first one. Including Sylvester Stallone, David Hasselhoff, and some dope who has a name that is so funny that you can\'t stop giggling every time somebody says ""Taserface"".', ""The stolen batteries thing at the start could have easily been written out of the movie, but it's otherwise really good. Love the father-son stuff."", ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2 plays it safe by repeating what made 2014's Guardians of the Galaxy a wonderful film, yet fails to amuse as much as its predecesor did. It's more colourful, more vibrant, more nonchalant and personal, but gives the sensation of relying too much on the popularity of the first film, with the same goofy characters doing goofy things and only a couple of them showing a real grow. Still a great experience, but not greater than the last one."", ""The first film was the most unexpected. That was one of the most colourfull space films I have ever seen. Youthful, energetic, fantastic visuals and so the same followed in this sequel as well. Not the same good, but stood to the expectation of the first film's success. This story does not have a great adventure in the galaxy. A simple quest, but a thrilling action-adventure. Now this accidental space gang is set to meet the creator.It's time for Peter to meet his father, Ego. As he still upset with his mother's death, his encounter with his father was not as expectedly smooth. On the other side of the story, Rocket, Yandu, Baby Groot make their escape from the captivity. They all end up on the Ego's planet where the rest of the film going to take place. Being the guardians of the galaxy, their fight against the whoever threaten the safety of the universe once again tested with their strength as a team.James Gunn did it again. And I'm confident that he's going to do the same for next as well. All the actors were fantastic like the previous film. This time, little fun with little Groot. Anybody who loved the first would love it too. Being a franchise from Marvel universe, it is yet to join the 'Avengers'. So far so good. I'm now expecting one of the best of best trilogies. Bring it on the volume 3.8/10."", ""Much like the first one this had a great mix of comedy and action. It was different than the other movies in the MCU but in a good way. I'm really curious how this fits in to the whole MCU but I'm sure they'll explain it."", 'Such a great sequel! Every Guardians movie is every better than the previous!', ""It's hard to compete with the first movie of The Guardians of the Galaxy, the first was beyond good, setting the standards very high. This one falls a little short of the first giving us a cliché plot, but it's still an excellent film. The filming was amazing, the CGI top notch, the sound track was beautiful, the cast once again brought a spectacular performance and above all the jokes were fantastic. Guardians of the Galaxy Part two, explores some of the questions brought out in the first film, taking you deeper into the characters lives and personality. I loved the addition of Mantis to the team, the jokes between her and Drax are hilarious. I'm eager to see what they can do with the third installment."", ""I think the Guardians installments to the MCU are some of the greatest. They're some of the most action packed with a family-centric storyline, strong characters, a lot of laughs, and excellent plots.Guardians 2 is magnificent much like its predecessor and one I could watch again and again."", ""People always regard this as simply a comic book or super hero movie, it is based on a comic but is absolutely a phenomenal scifi , for me the best ever filmed!! James Gunn is obviously a scifi buff and I'm not sure if he actually knows this but I'm 60 years old and have seen them all from the great 1950s classics to the cheesy 1970s and 80s scifi and this without a doubt is the best ever made!! It puts it all together everything we've learned from the 40 plus years of scifi this one is the pinnacle!! Absolutely breathtakingly brilliantly filmed and executed. I cant add anymore than that but to say BRAVO, Villisamo!!!! Bring on part 3!!!!"", 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2(2017) uses the same charming formula of the first movie, Fun & Action, and it works! This time around we actually get a deep emotional kick, learning more about the characters we all love while also adding depth to their personalities.Usually sequels struggle to reach the same level of the original movie since you kind of get used to the characters but I say that this movie is a success.', ""Another enjoyable entry, 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2' is very good fun.I actually didn't find the story in this as interesting as in the first film, but the humour - which is still up to the mark in 'Guardians of the Galaxy' - is much greater here; it got more laughs from me, that's for sure. The ending to this is also entertaining.Chris Pratt and Co. are just as enjoyable as before, with Dave Bautista particularly standing out to me here; if only due to his amusing moments. I like the addition of Pom Klementieff, I can see a spot for her in the crew. Kurt Russell and Elizabeth Debicki make for contrasting newcomers, Russell is just about good but I felt Debicki and her lot were underused/unintriguing.Not the most compelling plot, which I found more predictable than what the MCU usually produces, but the strong action end and noteworthy humour elevates it to become a pleasant film to watch; if a drop from the original."", ""I do not understand why this movie isn't talked about more. It's emotion, though not as much as the first movie, because how could it be...that movie started with Peter witnessing his mother's death. Anyways, this movie is also the absolute funniest movie in the MCU, no competition. And the cast are arguably just as good as they were in the first movie. Don't even get me started on the score, which I play on repeat. Overall, this movie isn't the best movie of phase three but it is the most underrated and definitely is the funniest.8.4/10."", ""DAMN YOU James Gunn, for making me cry again. I'll forgive you due to cute bug lady, but you better not kill Baby Groot. This is your final warning. Sincerely, Mary Poppins."", ""This was a solid sequel. In my opinion, the first movie was at this point in 2017 was the third best in the universe, this was nothing like the first movie, but it was still great. This movie was a little bit better than the first movie in 1 way, this one gave me better laughs, especially the Mantis scene when she gave away Peter's deepest secret, I laughed so hard I was crying. Also the scene where Rocket, Groot, Yondu, and Kraglin jumped 177 systems and their faces became distorted was hilarious. Lastly, once again, Drax and his stupidity stole the show, he is just hilarious. This movie also had a good plot. I thought it was cool how they tied in Peter's issue with losing his mother and not knowing who his father is. The acting of the new addition, Mantis was great, I think Pom Klementieff played Mantis perfectly, it is a very unique character to play and she was great. Lastly, the final battle scene was really cool, I won't get into spoilers, but it was very unique.This movie wasn't as good as the first, but it was still great. I recommend this to anyone who wants to watch it, especially if you are a Baby Groot fan."", 'This movie was just as fun as the first movie. Marvel does this very well. The casting was amazing. Mantis was also good.I liked it very much.', ""#MCUrewatch. GotG2 has the same great humor as the first film. Once again the entire cast is in top form but for me the real highlights of this film (apart from a great Baby Groot title sequence) are Drax (the droll manner with which Bautista says his lines is classic) and Yondu (Rooker is terrific as a Han Solo like space pirate). As I said: the humor is great and director Gunn manages to create a visceral and unique film in terms of esthetics. But...there is something wrong with the plot and story here. GotG1 was a straightforward mission like film. Here...there really is no mission. Just our heroes hanging about. The middle act kinda drags on (especially the Ego sequences) and the finale feels a bit like a rehash of the Dr Strange climax (visually that is). And in terms of plot it is sometimes a bit too much on the nose (although Yondu's farewell line is classic). It is a shame the story/plot aren't as good as in the first film, since all the other things are."", 'I really enjoyed watching this movie. The family romance, the jokes, and the story, all works for me. The plot is good, all matches, quite makes sense. The most of it is the ending, very nice to close the film. 8/10 movie (personal rate)', 'The Guardians of the Galaxy are hired by the leader of the well-planned Sovereign race Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki) to destroy a monster to protect their valuable batteries. Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista), Rocket and Baby Groot defeat the monster and receive the notorious Nebula (Karen Gillan), who is Gamora estranged sister, as previously agreed to receive the bounty offered for her. However Rocket steals a couple of batteries and their spacecraft is attacked by the Ayesha and Sovereign. Out of the blue, the Sovereign fleet is destroyed by a mysterious ship and the Guardians crash on a planet. Soon they learn that the ship that helped them is owned by Ego (Kurt Russell), who claims to be Quill\'s father and invites Quill to visit his planet. He goes with Gamora and Drax while Rocket fix their space craft with Baby Groot and Nebula cuffed to debris.They head to the planet and Gamora and Drax Befriend the empathetic Mantis (Pom Klementieff) while Quill learns from the celestial Ego that he has powerful abilities. Meanwhile Ayesha hires the outcast Ravager Yondu Udonta (Michael Rooker), who raised Quill, to hunt down the Guardians for them. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" is a magnificent sequel, with a full of action story and top-notch CGI. The witty humor associated to charismatic characters and cameo of famous actors make ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" a wonderful entertaining film. There are several scenes in the credit; therefore the viewer musts wait until the very end. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Guardiões da Galáxia Vol. 2"" (""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"")', 'Missouri, Planet Earth, 1980Meredith Quill (Laura Haddock) is riding in a car, listening to tunes on the radio with her boyfriend (Kurt Russell), whom she calls her ""spaceman"". They go behind a Dairy Queen and run into the woods where the man shows Meredith a small alien seedling, which he says will eventually be all over the place. He then kisses Meredith.34 years later.The Guardians of the Galaxy, Peter Quill/Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista), Rocket Raccoon (voice of Bradley Cooper), and Baby Groot (voice of Vin Diesel) are standing on a platform as they try to secure Anulax Batteries from their latest employers, the Sovereigns. The Guardians have their weapons ready as they gear up to battle an interdimensional beast known as the Abilisk. The Abilisk descends, leading the Guardians to spring into action, except for Groot, who is jamming out to ""Mr. Blue Sky"" on a speaker that Rocket set up, all while the others are trying to annihilate the Abilisk. Drax ends up falling on the speaker, to Groot\'s dismay. Since they cannot harm the Abilisk from the outside, Drax tries to kill it from inside by allowing it to swallow him. Star-Lord notices a cut on the monster\'s neck and orders Rocket to get it to look up. Gamora then slices the Abilisk downward, killing it and letting Drax spill out of the hole.The Guardians bring the batteries back to the Sovereigns and meet with their High Priestess, Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki). In exchange for the batteries, the Sovereigns deliver Gamora\'s sister Nebula (Karen Gillan) to the Guardians so that they can take her to Xandar and collect the bounty for her. Before they leave, Ayesha talks down to the Guardians, but Peter in particular, noting his half-human/half-alien heritage gives him something she deems reckless. The Guardians leave, with Rocket swiping some of the batteries for himself.On their way to the planet Xandar, the Guardians are suddenly met by a fleet of Sovereign drones, all going after them for the stolen batteries. The others figure it was Rocket that took them, and they\'re all pissed off. The drones start attacking as Rocket tries to steer the Milano toward a wormhole that will lead them to another planet. In the distance, another craft passes by and starts to destroy the Sovereign drones. A man appears to stand on his ship and wave to the Guardians. The Guardians escape the drones but must crash-land on a nearby planet.As the Guardians observe the wreckage of their ship, the other ship that saved them descends. Stepping out is Ego, who reveals himself to be Peter\'s father. With him is his empathic assistant Mantis (Pom Klementieff).On another planet, Yondu Udonta (Michael Rooker) and his team of Ravagers have fallen on hard times. He is staying in a nearby hotel (where Howard The Duck is also in attendance). Yondu spots his old comrade Stakar Ogord (Sylvester Stallone), who has exiled Yondu from the Ravager team for child trafficking. Among the Ravagers is Taserface (Chris Sullivan), who thinks the Ravagers need a new leader, along with Kraglin (Sean Gunn), who has since also come to question Yondu\'s leadership. After Yondu finishes talking to Stakar, the Sovereigns arrive, and Ayesha approaches Yondu with a proposition.Peter is still in shock to finally be meeting his father. Ego explains that he sent Yondu to pick Peter up after his mother died. Peter still also doesn\'t understand why Ego left Meredith in the first place. He invites Peter and his friends to his planet, which Peter is hesitant about until Gamora convinces him to join his father. Peter, Gamora, and Drax go with Ego and Mantis while Rocket and Groot stay behind to fix the Milano and keep an eye on Nebula.On Ego\'s ship, the three talk to Mantis, who shows off her powers by seeing into their minds. She lets everyone know that Peter has sexual feelings for Gamora, which Drax finds hilarious.The Ravagers come across the woods where the Guardians crash-landed. Most of them end up walking into traps laid out by Rocket until Yondu shows up with his Yaka Arrow controlled through his whistling. The Ravagers get Rocket and Groot, but when Taserface plans to get Peter, Yondu isn\'t quite as willing to turn him over. Nebula then breaks the crest on Yondu\'s head to knock him out. She aligns herself with the Ravagers as they take Rocket, Groot, and Yondu prisoner.Ego brings everyone to the planet that literally lives through him, as Ego is a Celestial and his consciousness is the core of the planet. He explains to the three that he came up with a human form to travel the galaxy and he came to Earth and fell in love with Meredith, but could not see her so often because it would take up a lot of his energy. Peter continues to hold hostile feelings for Ego for leaving Meredith alone to die. As Peter grows more emotional, his hands produce powerful energy that is linked to Ego\'s own power. Ego shows him how to control and use it.On the Ravager ship, Taserface and his goons start ejecting those that are still loyal to Yondu, except for Kraglin, who only watches in disbelief as his friends are killed. When Taserface boasts of his greatness and ""fearful"" name, Rocket only mocks him. Nebula enters and suggests that the Ravagers turn in their captives to the Kree for the bounties on their heads. She also makes other demands, including a new hand. Kraglin brings her to a ship that she uses to get off the Ravager ship and to go find Gamora.Mantis and Drax form a bond, though Drax continues to remind Mantis that he finds her hideous, but that it is a good thing because he thinks he is hideous as well and still managed to find someone else that loved him for who he is. Mantis says that she needs to tell Drax something important, but Gamora interrupts things and Mantis keeps quiet, instead just taking the two to their rooms.The Ravagers throw Rocket and Yondu in a cell while they take Groot for their own entertainment. Yondu mentions how he was Kree battle slave before Stakar pulled him out and made him a Ravager. When Rocket asks about why Yondu kept Peter around, he insists it\'s because Peter was small enough to fit in spaces where the others couldn\'t. The two then resolve to work together to break out of there. They get Groot to come by, and Yondu tells him to get a prototype fin for his head. After bringing a bunch of wrong items, Yondu gets his fin and gets himself and Rocket out. Yondu sends the arrow through every mutinous Ravager they come across, which Rocket and Groot get in on some Ravager ass-kicking themselves. The three board an escape ship with Kraglin, but not before Yondu sets the whole ship to blow up. Taserface gets hit with flames, but he manages to notify Ayesha to Yondu\'s whereabouts before he goes down with the ship. The other four must go through 700 jumps to get to Ego\'s planet.Back on Ego\'s planet, Peter tries to woo Gamora with his dance moves, but it doesn\'t quite work as she cannot bring herself to express her own attraction to him. After she leaves, Gamora then sees Nebula coming down on her ship, shooting at Gamora. As Nebula crash-lands, she jumps out to start fighting Gamora. Nebula manages to overpower Gamora but reveals that she never wanted to prove she was better than her, just that she wanted to have a real sister. Gamora\'s success as a warrior led to their father Thanos mutilating Nebula, leading to her resentment of Gamora. The two then form a sort-of alliance as they come across a cavern filled with about a hundred skeletons.Peter and Ego continue to bond. Ego tells Peter that as long as there is light in the planet, Peter will retain his powers, as well as immortality. Mantis sees that Ego has Peter wrapped around his finger now that he knows about his own powers. She rushes to wake up Drax to warn him that Ego\'s true intentions are now clear.Rocket, Groot, Yondu, and Kraglin make it to their destination. Rocket starts to gloat that he wants to save Peter just to prove he\'s better than him and can hang it over his head, but Yondu shuts Rocket up by stating how scared Rocket really is and how he puts on the tough guy thing as a facade. They then set off to take on Ego.Ego explains to Peter that he wants to make what he calls ""The Expansion"". He went around the galaxy to thousands of other worlds to plant the seedlings to grow his power over the galaxy and cover the planets in an extension of himself. He impregnated women from those worlds and produced many children that Yondu delivered to him, but when they did not possess the same power of a Celestial, Ego had them killed, and now their bones are what Gamora and Nebula found. Peter just so happens to hold the power that Ego was looking for. Ego also reveals that he put the tumor that killed Meredith in her head so that he would not feel the pain of being apart from her. Peter snaps out of it and begins to unload his guns on Ego in fury. In response, Ego takes Peter and controls him to start spreading the seedlings across the planets, causing mass destruction. To top it off, Ego crushes Peter\'s Walkman and Awesome Mix Volume 2 that his mother left him.Rocket, Groot, and Yondu meet up with Gamora, Drax, Nebula, and Mantis as they gear up to stop Ego. Unfortunately, they are also met by a fleet of Sovereigns out to kill them as well. Peter fights Ego\'s human form, but his entire planet self fights back. Mantis is able to put Ego to sleep while the Guardians take care of the others. They fight back against the Sovereigns and eventually destroy their whole fleet with a bunch of lasers. Meanwhile, Rocket builds a bomb using the batteries he stole, which Groot takes and runs off with, despite Rocket warning him not to push the wrong button or else they\'ll all die. Mantis gets knocked out by a fireball, breaking her hold on Ego and reawakening him. As the others try to get safe, Ego begins to consume them. Peter continues fighting his father using his Celestial powers. Now freed, Groot then finds Ego\'s brain in the planet\'s core, and he sets the bomb to go off in five minutes.Drax carries Mantis to the ship while Gamora and Nebula make it back. Rocket gives his last spacesuit to Yondu, knowing he cannot save both him and Peter. Gamora tries to go back, but Rocket stops her so he doesn\'t lose another friend. Ego pleads with Peter to stop the bomb, or else Peter will just be a normal human. Peter sees nothing wrong with that and lets the bomb go off. Ego\'s human form disintegrates as the rest of the planet starts to explode. Yondu flies by and grabs Peter. As they leave the planet\'s atmosphere, Yondu puts the suit on Peter to save him. He tells Peter that while Ego was his father, he was never his daddy. Yondu then starts to freeze up in space, and Peter sadly watches him die.The Guardians prepare to give Yondu a proper Ravager funeral. Kraglin gives Peter a Zune to make up for his lost Walkman, which Yondu had been meaning to give him for a while. In return, Peter gives Kraglin Yondu\'s arrow, feeling that Yondu would have wanted him to take it. Nebula sets off to hunt Thanos down herself, but not before reconciling with Gamora. Mantis decides to stay with the Guardians. As Yondu\'s body goes out into space, the Guardians see dozens of other Ravager ships arriving to pay their respects to Yondu.There are five end credits scenes that follow:Kraglin tries to practice using the arrow. He doesn\'t quite get the hang of it, and he ends up sticking Drax with it.\nStakar honors Yondu\'s sacrifice by forming his own team with Martinex T\'Naga (Michael Rosenbaum), Charlie-27 (Ving Rhames), Starhawk (Michelle Yeoh), and Mainframe (Miley Cyrus).Ayesha and another Sovereign discuss their new plan to take down the Guardians. We see Ayesha sitting by a birthing pod, waiting to break out whatever is inside to use against the Guardians. She decides to call it ""Adam"" (as in, Adam Warlock).Groot is now a teenager. Peter scolds him for leaving his roots lying around, but Groot just mocks him and plays video games.The elderly Stan Lee, in his obligatory cameo, is sitting with the Watchers, discussing his previous adventures, but they become bored and leave him.']"
42,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Spider-Man: Homecoming,2250912,"[""Really enjoyed the first two films, both contained great scenes/action, acting and the two best villains of the films. Was mixed on the third film, which wasn't that bad but suffered mainly from bloat, and was not totally sold on the 'Amazing Spider-Man' films.Whether 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' is the best 'Spider-Man' film ever is debatable, some may prefer the first two films, others may prefer this. To me, it is the best 'Spider-Man' film since the second and on par with the first two. It may not have taken as many risks or had sequences/action as memorable as the first two films, and for more of an origin story it's best to stick with the first two films. For a fresh twist on 'Spider-Man' and the superhero genre, 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' (one of Marvel's best to date) more than fits the bill.'Spider-Man: Homecoming' is not quite the masterpiece as proclaimed to me and maybe not quite as good as the acclaim, but personally can totally see why it is loved so much and that it deserves all the positivity it's received. It has a couple of faults, Liz is a bland and underwritten character and Laura Harrier does nothing with the character. Flash also could have been much more intimidating in demeanour and physicality, for a bully one is not intimidated, pretty anaemic actually and even annoying at times.Much more could have been done with Spider-Man's powers and how he got around, they could have been better used, being not used enough, and of better quality.However, 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' looks great. Slick, stylish with bold, atmospheric use of colour and mostly top-notch special effects. Michael Giacchino pens yet another winner of a music score, both rousing and hypnotic with also an intensity and emotional undercurrent.It's a remarkably well scripted film too. It has some hilarious and rarely forced humour (namely from Ned and Michelle, both of whom should have been annoying but were refreshing scene-stealing comic relief), poignancy and tension. The story works well as a superhero story, with great chemistry between Peter and Tony Stark and a terrific scene in a car with our hero and Vulture, and even more so as an affectionate and easy to relate to coming of age and trying-to-fit-in story. The action is kept at minimum but what there is is fun and suspenseful, even if there were sequences and climaxes more memorable in the first two films.A risk was taken having Jon Watts in the director's chair, but luckily inexperience doesn't show, there is a great sense of visual style and momentum is kept taut. A great cast also helps, with Tom Holland doing a wonderful job in the complex dual role, both roles are easy to relate to and he differentiates the two personalities of nerdy, awkward high school deadline and charismatic head-line-making superhero with remarkable ease.Michael Keaton, fresh from giving two of his best performances in years in 'Birdman' and 'Spotlight', is also superb as Vulture, a refreshingly different and more complex villain than most Marvel villains, a menacing villain but with a humane side with a far less generic motivation than one would find in other Marvel films and doesn't feel underused. A villain that one is intimidated by but also feel sorry for. Marissa Tomei seemed bizarre casting on paper but she is very charming actually and fits well.Robert Downey Jnr brings charismatic intensity and authority to Tony Stark, Jon Favreau is fun while Jacob Batalon and Zendaya are refreshing comic relief.Overall, very good, often great and very nearly outstanding (which it would have been if more care was given to a few of the supporting characters). 8/10 Bethany Cox"", ""HOMECOMING is the latest Spider-Man movie; given that no less than five other Spider-Man movies came out in the 15 years preceding this one, you can forgive audiences (and myself) for being a bit fatigued of the character. While I did like the Raimi trilogy (mainly as a fan of the director), I thought the Andrew Garfield reboots were terrible. The good news is that HOMECOMING, which ties the character in to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, is better than those, although still not great.Spider-Man still has the problem of being one of the more annoying Marvel superheroes, and all of the high school stuff is by now a chore to sit through. The film smacks of cliche at times (I can't quite belief that the Asian-American guy is reduced to the comic relief best friend role) while the action is rather routine. The running time is overlong too, although the CGI effects remain as good as you'd expect. Tom Holland is okay but a bit bland and earnest in the lead role, with the stand-out being Michael Keaton, underused but remaining hugely entertaining to watch."", ""Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) *** (out of 4) Another highly entertaining entry into the Marvel universe has Peter Parker (Tom Holland) trying to find a balance between his high school years and wanting to join The Avengers as Spider-Man. While all of this is going on Vulture (Michael Keaton) is creating some high tech and dangerous weapons to sell on the streets.SPIDER-MAN: HOMECOMING seemed to get a lot of mixed reviews but I personally thought it was very entertaining and in fact I thought it was much better than WONDER WOMAN. What's amazing is that this is the third reboot of this series going back to the Sam Raimi films and it's really amazing that the studio keeps managing to get the perfect casts to pull the stories off. This film not only works as a very good action movie but I thought the teenage drama stuff worked quite nicely as well.As I stated, the performances here really help make the film as entertaining as it is. The performance by Holland was excellent and I thought he was perfect during the scenes where the character is actually being a nerd and conflicted with various emotions. Keaton was also wonderful in his role as he perfectly played the villain. Robert Downey, Jr. could sleepwalk in his role as Tony Stark but he's always fun as is Jon Favreau in his part. Donald Glover and Bokeem Woodbine were also very good as was Laura Harrier as the love interest. Marisa Tomei looks great but she's a bit too young for her role as Aunt May. Even Jacob Batalon adds nice comic relief.The action scenes are all highly exciting and it's the perfect use of CGI. I'm not a CGI fan but there's no question that it mixes in perfectly well with the rest of the footage. I'd also argue that the story itself was quite good in regards to everything going wrong in Parker's personal life and I thought the screenplay perfectly handled his emotions of trying to balance everything. Technically the film is very impressive from start to finish and there are some truly great scenes scattered throughout the picture.SPIDER-MAN: HOMECOMING is certainly one of the better action pictures of recent years and it's highly recommended."", ""Salvager Adrian Toomes (Michael Keaton) holds a grudge against Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) after his takeover of the Battle of New York cleanup. Toomes kept some of the Chitauri tech to create new weapons. Eight years later after the events of Civil War, Peter Parker (Tom Holland) returns to his school, Midtown School of Science and Technology. He lives with his sought-after aunt May (Marisa Tomei). He has a crush on classmate Liz. His best friend Ned discovers his secret identity Spider-Man. There is also the sarcastic academic teammate Michelle (Zendaya).This is fun. It's got the comic book action. It weaves into the MCU with ease. RDJ has a supporting role which is more than a simple cameo. This definitely has the John Hughes vibe. It's nice light fun in this overarching comics universe. Holland is a great teen Spider-man as he showed in Civil War. The young cast is terrific and Keaton is an awesome villain. Keaton has real depth which is built over the years. His humanity creates more than a comic book villain. The surprise connection hits it out of the park. This is simply a good movie."", ""Since I'm seeing this movie as a layperson, not one at the altar of the comic book gods, I'm evaluating it from that standpoint. I've seen most of the Marvel films and have had a level of enjoyment. I love the special effects but most of all getting to know the humanity of the principles. The better the story lines the better the movie. Here, Peter Parker is kind of a cliché as a teenager. Still, he is fun and a bit dense. If I have an issue, it is his over confidence at times. For one with his gifts he can be quite naive. We have numerous moments when everything could explode but he manages to escape detection. I have to say that I'm growing tired of the physical confrontations, the violent fights. When two foes can't seem to harm each other no matter what they do, it actually gets a little dull. Still, I think this film bodes well for the future. One of the better. Oh, Michael Keaton lights up the screen."", ""You know you are getting old when you start fancying Aunty May! Then again actress Marisa Tomei is only a few years older than me.Spiderman has been rebooted again but at least we are spared another origins story. With close interaction with the Marvel universe, Tom Holland having debuted in Captain America: Civil War now has his own standalone film with Iron Man and Captain America popping up here and there.Holland's Peter Parker is an overexcitable teenager pestering Tony Stark to let him become an Avenger. Stark gives him an all tech Spidey suit as well as the services of Happy Hogan.The bad guy is The Vulture/Adrian Toomes played by Michael Keaton, a salvage contractor that cleans up alien artifacts that has been put out of business by Stark's companies. Now he uses alien technology for nefarious means such as heists and that puts him on a collision course with Spiderman. However Parker does not realise how close to home Toomes really is.The film never really soared for me, I think I was put off by the bored looking Jon Favreau playing Happy Hogan and maybe they should had toned down the appearances of Tony Stark who is in it a bit too much.There were some nice set pieces such as Spiderman saving his schoolmates from the Washington Monument. It was fun seeing Keaton as the Vulture after the actor hit the limelight again by playing Birdman but I did not think much of the villain apart from an honest man who became a leader of a bunch of thugs."", '""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" is the worst Spider Man ever made, totally overrated, long, boring and unfunny. The annoying lead actor Tom Holland, has an irritating tone of voice. The screenplay and the actor unsuccessfully try to be funny, but unfortunately nothing works in this film that looks like a spoof, at least for an adult. My vote is one (awful).Title (Brazil): ""Homem-Aranha: De Volta ao Lar"" (""Spider-Man: Homecoming"")', ""I watched this film a day or so after watching Wonder Woman, a film which had disappointed by how meh it all was throughout. I came into this one expecting it to be yet another by-the-numbers superhero film, but was reminded by it how well Marvel have delivered their franchise. By all rights, this film should be a disaster. It is the third reboot of the character in recent years, it is part of a massive infrastructure of characters and stories, and it enters a very heavily saturated marketplace. How then does it manage to seem so effortless in what it does?I'm not sure but it benefits from the confidence that all the other films in the franchise do. It sets out its stall well, doesn't waste time on an origin story even though it does start early with its character. It has a solid plot with interesting characters, and produces lots of good action with humor throughout. It is an entertaining film that justifies the cost, and unlike Wonder Woman, the effects are consistently impressive and seem natural. It is a bit too slick and polished at times; some jokes and elements are a bit too knowing for example, and the cast has far too many recognizable faces in it that really only deliver a few lines. All of it has a quality feel, but at times it does feel a bit too manufactured within an inch of its life. Well worth seeing though, and yet another enjoyable film in the Marvel universe."", 'This is the sequel to the Avenger film which briefly introduced a geeky Spider-Man and not a sequel to the one where they killed off Emma Stone. I apologize if you haven\'t seen that one yet. Peter Parker (Tom Holland) is now in NYC and is crushing on Liz (Laura Harrier) who is crushing on Spider-Man...like the Lois Lane thing, but add in High School and teen angst. Spider-Man has a contact man for the Avengers, ironically named Happy (Jon Favreau). Through a mishap, his identity is discovered by a geek friend (Jacob Batalon) who becomes his ""chair man."" Spider-Man is not yet part of the Avengers as of this time and is still semi-separate from them. The film gives him a powerful enemy (Michael Keaton) but not too powerful, i.e. someone within Spider-man\'s wheelhouse.The ending was slightly unexpected and we find out that Gwyneth Paltrow is not dead. Stan Lee cameo near the beginning.Guide: No sex or nudity. Frequent use of the word ""penis"" as in \'Penis Parker."" A cut WTF at the end.', ""Obviously this plays in the Marvel Universe, so for a complete understanding it does not hurt to have seen a couple of other movies. Especially the Iron Man ones. But and that is important, even if this is the first one you're watching you won't be disappointed. And as you can see by the general rating, I'm not alone with this statement.So taking an 80s classic and putting a Spiderman costume on it ... well you get this as a result. It's a pretty solid movie and having the blueprint of a classic injected you can see why this works. It allows for something far more than just a superhero movie. I have to admit I was skeptical with Spiderman in the previous let's call it cameo he did in the Captatin America movie. It seemed like he was belittled. Even the fact that Iron Man was going to be in this one seemed like taking away the spotlight from the man (boy) who's supposed to be the star.But all of it was worries that never really manifested. Actually we have a Spiderman who walked the thin line Toby Maguire couldn't in Spiderman 3 not so long ago. Of course that wasn't entirely Tobys fault (script issues, producers influence and so forth). But it all lead to this moment, so let's take the positive ... and enjoy! Also do I have to point out there are scenes in and after the credits? The one after the credits - well let's say you'll either love it or hate it. I loved it!"", 'This is the first Marvel super-hero movie I\'ve seen that appeared to be geared to a young teenage market rather than a general audience one. For perspective, I\'m a senior citizen myself, so it\'s probably obvious that I see it that way, but I never got the same impression with Spider-Man movies in the past. Could be all the high school scenes pointed me in that direction, but I didn\'t get the sense that this was a movie for adults.The character of Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) in this one bothered me too. It wasn\'t the arrogance so much because that\'s what the Stark persona is all about. If anything, Iron Man\'s alter-ego seemed almost wishy-washy to me, considering how he went back and forth on his relationship with Peter Parker (Tom Holland). He upbraided Parker for having doubts about being Spider-Man (see my summary line above), wasn\'t that upset when Peter decided against joining The Avengers, then backtracked again after the battle with The Vulture (Michael Keaton). I guess I\'m saying he should have been more consistent in his attitude.Having read about three dozen other reviews for this film, one thing that surprised me was how no one else has mentioned the startling similarity between Keaton\'s Vulture and the character he portrayed in 2014\'s Best Picture ""Birdman"". It was the first thing I thought about when I saw Keaton appear as the film\'s villain. The interesting aspect to the story for me had to do with the human dynamic between Adrian Toomes and Peter Parker, each one knowing the alter-ego of the other, thereby adding resonance to Parker\'s teenage angst over the relationship with Toomes\' daughter who Peter had an eye for.Great to see Stan Lee once again in a Marvel film cameo. he was the tenement dweller looking out the window and commenting on the commotion below, stating ""Don\'t make me come down there, you punk."" At the age of ninety four, the guy\'s still got plenty of spark.', ""Tobey Maguire came first and pulled it off, Andrew Garfield came second and sort of took it backwards, then finally the web-slinging hero made his debut alongside the other Avengers in Captain America: Civil War, so of course he would get his new solo movie soon after, expectations were high. Basically following the Battle of New York, Adrian Toomes (Michael Keaton) and his salvage company are contracted to clean up the city, but the Department of Damage Control (D.O.D.C.), owned by Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), takes over the operation. Before being stopped, Toomes and his team scavenged Chitauri technology, enraged being out of business, Toomes persuades his employees the keep and use these to create and sell advanced weaponry. Eight years later, Stark drafts Peter Parker aka Spider-Man (The Impossible's Tom Holland) into the Avengers to help with an internal dispute, but following the airport fight, Stark does not feel Parker is ready to become a full Avenger, so Parker resumes his studies at the Midtown School of Science and Technology. Parker quits his school's academic decathlon team to spend more time focusing on his crime-fighting activities as Spider-Man. One night, Parker prevents criminals robbing an ATM, using their advanced weaponry, after which he returns to his Queens apartment, where his best friend Ned (Jacob Batalon) discovers his secret identity. On another night, Parker nearly drowns intervening in a business deal, where Toomes' associates Jackson Brice aka Shocker (Logan Marshall- Green) and Herman Schultz (Bokeem Woodbine) are selling weapons to local criminal Aaron Davis (Donald Glover), Stark as Iron Man rescues him, he has been monitoring him with the Spider-Man suit he gave him, Stark warns Parker getting involved with dangerous criminals. Toomes accidentally kills Brice with one of the advanced weapons, Schultz becomes the new Shocker, Brice left behind a weapon, Parker and Ned study it and remove its power core, Parker rejoins the decathlon team as they travel to Washington, D.C., with the real agenda to follow a tracking device on Schultz, leading to Maryland. Ned and Parker disable the tracker Stark implanted in the Spider-Man suit, while Parker unlocks its advanced features, with the help of A.I. voice Karen (Jennifer Connelly). Parker tries to stop Toomes, as the Vulture, in a technologically advanced mechanical flying suit, from stealing weapons from a D.O.D.C. truck, but Parker is overpowered and trapped inside the truck, causing him to miss the decathlon national tournament. Parker races to races to the Washington Monument when he discovers the power core is an unstable Chitauri grenade, it explodes and traps Ned and their friends in an elevator, Spider-Man evades the authorities and saves his friends, including his fellow classmate and crush Liz (Laura Harrier). Returning to New York City, Spider-Man confronts Davis, who reveals Toomes' whereabouts, Parker is able to capture Toomes' new buyer Mac Gargan (Michael Mando) aboard the Staten Island Ferry, but Toomes escapes and a malfunctioning weapon tears the ferry in half, the passengers are saved with the help of Iron Man, but Stark is angered by Parker's recklessness and takes away the Spider- Man suit. Parker returns to his high school life, and eventually asks Liz to the homecoming dance, on the night of the dance he is shocked to discover Liz's father is Toomes, he in turn deduces Parker's secret identity, he threatens retaliation is he interferes with his plans. During the dance, the Avengers Tower is being emptied ready to move to the new headquarters, Parker realises Toomes plans to hijack a D.O.D.C. plane transporting weapons from the tower. Parker dons his old homemade Spider-Man suit, he is ambushed by Schultz at Toomes' lair, he defeats him with the help of Ned, Toomes then destroys the building's support beams and leaves Parker to die. Parker escapes the rubble, intercepts the D.O.D.C. plane, causing it to crash near Coney Island, Parker and Toomes fight, it ends with Parker saving Toomes from his own unstable equipment, he is left for the police, along with the plane's cargo. In the end Liz moves away after her father is arrested, Parker is invited by Stark to join the Avengers full time, he declines, but Stark returns his Spider-Man suit, Peter's Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) walks in just as he is putting his suit on., while in prison Toomes purposely denies to Gargan that he knows Spider-Man's real identity. Also starring Jon Favreau as Happy Hogan, Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts, Zendaya as Michelle, Tony Revolori as Flash, Tyne Daly as Anne Marie Hoag, Kenneth Choi as Principal Morita, Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America and Stan Lee as Gary. British actor Holland proves the perfect choice to play the spirited and wise-cracking hero, Keaton does well as the villain, Downey Jr. is good supporting the lead hero, and there is good support from Tomei and Favreau, I think Zendaya deserves the biggest mention, brilliant comic relief as the hilariously snidey classmate. The story is clever, connecting the Avengers movies seen previously, there is no need to go into a Spider-Man origins story, it just gets straight to point, where the hero is trying to prove himself and save people whenever possible, and the special effects combined with exciting set pieces are fantastic, a most impressive superhero fantasy action adventure. Very good!"", 'Right, well another year and another superhero movie, seems about the turn of the mill these recent years. Was I thrilled when this movie was announced? No. Did I stand in line to watch it in the cinema? No.Well, I watched ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" solely because I had the chance, not because it was a pressing matter on my \'movies-to-watch\' list.So did the world really need another Spider-Man movie? Well, not really, not if you ask me. And all this rebooting is just to the point of being ridiculous. Did we need a new actor to play Spider-Man? Hardly so.That being said, then I will say that Tom Holland actually fared well enough in the role as Peter Parker and Spider-Man. However, it was such a thrill and a blast to watch Michael Keaton in the movie, he was really so well-cast for the villain role and did so magnificently. His character was rather fun and interesting, and wore a cool outfit. However, I can\'t claim to be much fan of the high-tech Spider-Man outfit, however.""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" turned out to be fun and entertaining, but at the same time it was just another run of the mill superhero movie in my opinion. There was a little bit too much focus on how much destruction Spider-Man could muster in this movie, which made the movie feel a bit campy and corny.Being a Marvel movie, you know that you are in for a treat in the special effects department. And sure enough, the Marvel camp delivered a movie cramped with amazing special effects and superb CGI.Hardly a movie that I will watch a second time around, but then again that is how I feel about all superhero movies.', ""I had a reasonably fun time with Spiderman Homecoming, but I have a few big issues that prevent me from loving it...Firstly, Peter Parker's vulnerability/invulnerability. There's a scene where Spiderman bangs his head on the roof of a truck, knocking himself unconscious, yet later on in the film, a couple of tons of concrete and steel land on the lad's head with no lasting damage. Not long after, Peter falls to the ground from a crashing jet (presumably travelling at a couple of hundred miles an hour) and gets up without a problem. Concussion one minute, indestructible the next!Spiderman's strength is inconsistent too: Peter is holding together two halves of the Staten Island ferry in one scene, but later he is struggling to free himself from some rubble.I also have a problem with The Avengers' very lax approach to shifting their equipment to new premises: Happy (Jon Favreau) loads all of the Avenger's weapons/armour onto an unmanned aircraft - not one person to guard it. Of course, this suited the plot, but it was extremely daft. Surely a couple of superheroes could have taken time out from saving the world to escort the precious cargo.Last moan: did Spidey really need a high-tech suit equipped with AI and special assault modes? I thought Spiderman relied on Spidey sense.On a more positive note, I enjoyed Peter's trials and tribulations at high-school, and thought that the twist revelation about the true identity of Vulture was well handled (I didn't see it coming). The special effects are, as always, very impressive, and Director Jon Watts handles the action well enough, but Sam Raimi needn't worry: his first two Spiderman movies remain the best."", ""My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library. I read Spider Man comics growing up and really enjoyed the Toby Maguire version in 2002, the origin story was treated well and to me Maguire was the ideal actor to play Peter Parker and Spider Man.This reincarnation uses British actor Tom Holland in the lead role. He is fine, his American accent is very good, sounding much like Michael J Fox in the BTTF movies. He is suitably small and young-looking to play a high school teenager. As this story starts he has had some experience with the Avengers and wants more. Tony Stark (Downey Jr.) is his mentor.What I don't like is how Peter is cast as an often silly kid who always seems to be in some mess or the other. And when the action scenes are on they are very manic, to the point where the special effects become primary, the story secondary. Plus the several prior movies have better actors creating more interesting characters. Still, we were entertained, but you can't help comparing them to the ones that came before and when I do, this one doesn't measure up."", ""For the most part, if you were among those that saw Spider-Man/Peter Parker appear in Civil War and found him entertaining and, more to the point, *right* as that character and icon, then you will like him all the more in his first movie in this iteration. It's amazing to think that this is the sixth Spider-Man movies in 15 years, and yet this is the first in over a decade that understands this character, in large part making close to the comic books (I haven't read them religiously, but it seems to follow pretty close to the Ultimate run at the least, if not others). I don't know if every action scene is terribly original, but every one has massive stakes for Parker, and yet at the same time they're not the usual apocalyptic, end-of-the-world scenarios that sometimes can make a super-hero movie feel too big, even if the stakes are still strong. Everything is down to the personal here with Parker, and even more than the Raimi movies these get right the high school, awkward teenager part of Parker down pat.Now, was this all even necessary? I don't know, and that may be cause for debate among people for a long time. I got to look at what's put in front of me to say whether it works or not as its own thing; the previous try by Sony to get Spider-Man back into theaters after getting rid of Raimi, Amazing Spider-Man, felt tired and had its moments amid a very spotty story. I'm not even sure if it's necessarily that Marvel Studios *solely* could have brought Parker et al back, or then some, to former glory, but I think with Civil War being the dipping of the toes into the pool and this being the big dive and 1000-meter lap, that they got it right as they could. It all comes down to what makes any of these gigantic corporate products work, regardless of if it's Marvel or DC or whoever: are the actors convincing enough to bring the characters to life, and does the writing do right by them with a story that makes sense and characters that give them something to do? Holland found just the right note in Civil War as like a half of the time innocent-looking puppy of a teenager, the kind that we almost don't want to see get hurt, vulnerable and caring and showing the conflicts so perfectly that Parker has to deal with everyday in his balance as just a regular kid in extraordinary circumstances... but, other half of the time, he can certainly mouth-off and be convincing in that way that Spider-Man just was int the comics (that doesn't mean the comics are sacrosanct or anything, that they *had* to do that to get it right, it's merely to point that this Parker is a wise-ass but funny as hell at doing it, even down to a moment in a montage early on when he stops a guy stealing a bike). Meanwhile, the writers give Parker a best-friend/comic relief, a tired trope that feels totally revitalized here because a) the kid he's paired with is wonderfully dead-pan and yet excitable (kudos to Jacob Batalon as Ned Leeds getting it right), and b) he proves himself useful... maybe oddly, a lot, conveniently useful for a teenager, but I can suspend disbelief for a little while.And then there's Keaton; is he used properly, given how damn talented he is? Yes, but only up to a point. There's some moments, like a very tense exchange with the hero in a car, that have a crisp intensity that Keaton can just turn on as if it's nothing. Other times, he's having to work more in what the plot requires, and under his Vulture get-up - obviously, without question, right, a meta-comment in an ironic way regarding BIRDMAN - we don't get to see as much of it. It's in the third act he gets to flex his chops the most, without saying exactly why it's a wonderful twist that we don't see coming but makes sense. Even when he is in the midst of certain story continuity things (an 8 year jump is a bit odd, but again, we try to let it go on q first watch), he is... Michael Keaton. He's a lot of fun to watch.It's hard I think for me to fully analyze this right away as some profound work of art that may have more depth that needs a dive in. That may be all good now for the Raimi movies, but that's looking back over a decade. This is still too fresh, and the only thing I can say is that the writing of the story if 90% of it all tight and gives Parker and Spider-Man a solid, if a little predictable, arc as far as his hero's journey, and the dialog is consistently comedic. I found myself laughing far more than in any previous Spider-Man entry, and that's the key to its success: it knows it's silly in a way, or at least Parker recognizes it, and while the MCU is known for doing that (this year with GotG most of all), this feels even sillier. It knows it. We are let in on the fun. Despite any nitpicks and misgivings, and there are more I won't mention (one involving a character reveal that is right out of, of all things, Dark Knight Rises), it's among the better summer blockbusters in years because of that. 8.5/10"", ""With this entry, Spider-Man is once again rebooted. No origin story this time which is as well since anyone knows how he came to be if they read the comics or at least Wikipedia. Tom Holland is suitably youngish being the high school student Peter Parker originally was and remained for a while during his creation. Nice splashes of humor throughout during even some of the more serious scenes. Awesome seeing Michael Keaton-former Batman portrayer-playing a main villain this time in a superhero movie. Oh, and yes, Stan Lee makes another of his cameos in a MCU movie! Also, there's a scene after the main closing credits and another one after the final end of them. In summary, Spider-Man: Homecoming is worth it to watch for die-hard fans!"", ""Another reboot?! After three Toby Maguire fronted films (two of which I thought were great) and two with Andrew Garfield (that were OK, nothing special) in the lead it seemed very odd that Marvel would reboot the franchise yet again.Sadly for me third time is not the charm, and this film verges on being a bit silly and dare I say it pointless.Everyone gives decent enough performances, and its nice that it's more of a teen film, but having sat through better Spiderman films, this one seems to come up short."", 'This film tells the story of a young man who is selected by Tony Stark to be the trainee Spiderman. As he is desperate to prove himself, he runs into more trouble than he ever imagined. Soon, he appears to be out of his depth.""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" reminds me of ""Deadpool"" because of its light hearted atmosphere, and Peter\'s mischievous demeanour. The fact that Peter is in observation and training provides a good background to the mischief, otherwise I think it might have proved to be a little annoying. Spiderman is not the almighty hero, but someone who has the potential to be. It is nice to see a cameo from Captain America, and it creates a seamless transition for Spiderman from a standalone franchise to integrating into the Marvel Cinematic Universe.', ""Ok I think I've worked it out now. Peter parker IS Spider-Man."", 'There are almost as Many Spider-Man Costumes as Writers (6) in this Homecoming for Marvel\'s Biggest Super-Star.

The Costume Upgrades may have some Purists Moaning and Groaning, but it is Acceptable in a Post-Modern Paradigm Programmed by Computers.', ""I saw the very first Spider Man entry with Toby McGuire and Kirsten Dunst and whilst I enjoyed it I wasn't so enamored to watch any others until this current release which attracted excellent reviews. From minute one it was obvious that a lot had gone on in those other Spider Mans because it was barely the same Peter Parker/Spider-Man I met all those years ago. For one thing a lot is made of an outfit called The Avengers, which seems to be a group of superheroes bent on saving the planet and of which Spider-Man is a member. Then he has a 'mentor' in the shape of Robert Downey jnr, a 'special' friend best described as a nerd and has a crush on a Black schoolmate, so much for the Kirsten Dunst character. It seems evident that the last two or three Spider-Man movies are not so much stand-alones as sequential so I can only comment on this entry as something I only partly 'got'. Having said that it was reasonably entertaining if not (to me) as compelling as the original."", ""As a solo character Spider-Man has definitely gotten more play than any other Marvel character. The X-Men have had more movies overall but there are more of them as well.This version of Spider-Man is better than the Amazing Spider-Man but not quite as good as Toby McGuire's. They got back to the roots of Spider-Man being an awkward teenage nerd as opposed to this hip and witty Peter Parker that was featured in The Amazing Spider-Man.The movie was too derivative of Spider-Man 2002. The nemesis used a contraption to fly and something else that I don't want to give away. But truly this movie had an uphill climb simply because we've seen Spidey so much. There were five movies preceding this one where we've seen what the webslinger can do. How would this movie top those? It didn't. Tom Holland did a good enough job. He's younger looking, dorkier and even has a teenage voice to go with it but we've seen all of his stunts already. Having Iron Man make a cameo certainly helped but it couldn't completely save it. This was an alright movie but really it didn't have to be made."", 'This Spider-Man movie is the first Spider-Man movie in the Marvel canon. The prior two Spider-Man franchises are irrelevant to this series. Spider-Man, introduced in Captain America: Civil War, is part of the final phase of the Marvel Universe leading up to Avengers: The Infinity War. Marvel wisely opted to skip the origin story of Spider-Man and instead, framed this film to be more of a coming of age tale for Peter Parker (Tom Holland) and his quest to become part of the Avengers. Tony Stark aka Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr) is tasked with taking Peter under his wing. Of course, Peter only sees the glory of being a superhero and ends up taking on situations that are too big for him to handle on his own. He has to be bailed out by Iron Man on a couple different occasions. Peter seems to think that wearing the suit with all of its gadgets and fancy technology will bring him the tools he needs to be like idols Iron Man and Captain America--not realizing that there is much more too it than just fancy tools. One very poignant moment has Peter telling Tony that he is ""nothing without the (spider-Man) suit."" To which Tony responds very bluntly, ""then you don\'t deserve to wear the suit."" Tony is waiting for Peter to show something emotionally and mentally that proves to Tony and the rest of the Avengers that he has what it takes to be a viable member of the team.Much of the film involves Peter trying to figure out what it means to be Spider-Man. It\'s more than just foiling bank robberies by wrapping people up in his web. He\'s also trying to figure out who he is. Feeling like he\'s wasting his time in high school, he struggles to make friends and to fit in with his peers. He faces many of the normal issues that teenagers - especially ones that are unique- face such as bullying, crushing on a girl who seems out of his league, trying to juggle academics with outside commitments, and so on.Michael Keaton portrays ""Vulture,"" the villain whom Peter encounters. Vulture is somewhat sympathetic as he seems more like someone who always gets the short end of the stick and is just trying to get a piece of the pie. But of course, he takes it too far.Others in the cast involve: Marisa Tomei as Peter Parker\'s Aunt May; Gwyneth Paltrow appears as Pepper Potts, Tony Stark\'s assistant/girlfriend; Chris Evans reprises his role as Captain America appearing in educational PSA videos that Peter ends up watching during school; John Favreau reprises his role as Happy Hogan, head of security for the Avengers; and Disney star Zendaya plays one of Peter\'s classmates.', 'Being a teenager is hard. So\'s making a good movie about that existence, and this is thankfully the exception. If you have superpowers, and you think you could escape your awkward, meandering high school(which this one is actually about, only took 6 tries... and 1 for the MCU) life, yet can\'t seem to make it, it\'s all the more difficult. Peter Parker(Holland, awed, spot-on) is struggling to balance it all. When The Vulture(Keaton, psychopathic and sometimes charming, complex, one of the franchise\'s great villains), a gun-runner, starts moving product made up of alien tech left over by fights involving The Avengers, our lead knows he has to stop him.Spider-Man has finally gotten justice on the big screen. In a solo piece, I mean – his Civil War scenes nailed it, as well. You\'d think there\'d be no way we could get into another adventure with the wall-crawler. 5 times in 12 years?! How to even make it distinct? For one thing, we\'re spared the origin everyone already knows. ""With great power comes great responsibility"" isn\'t said, it\'s communicated non-verbally, as it remains a major theme. The logically limited(how could you swing if there\'s nothing tall around?) powers are now enhanced by gadgets, without it becoming an Iron Man film. Tony(Downey Jr., witty, and funny in his discomfort with the role of mentor) doesn\'t take over. The trailers show most of the bits he\'s in, and he doesn\'t fight alongside the webhead. Humor is a focus, without it feeling desperate. The cast are likable, other than, of course, Flash, re-imagined as a rich kid. While Liz(Harrier, sweet, smart, driven) is no Gwen, she definitely isn\'t a Mary Jane either, and, hey, not every major female character needs to be that active in saving the day. Too Disney, Nickelodeon, excessive collateral damage(especially considering that Stark takes most of it in stride, despite what happened between him and Steve)? Some will think so, and I can see why.I recommend this to everyone. Yes, you read that right. If you can enjoy any movie, give this one a chance. 8/10', 'The film opens in New York City the Avengers battled the Chitauri. Salvage worker Adrian Toomes (Michael Keaton) is showing his co-worker a drawing that his daughter made of the Avengers in action. They proceed to work on taking apart the Chitauri leviathan and gathering any tech they can get their hands on. Soon, a van from the U.S. Department of Damage Control arrives. Anne Marie Hoag (Tyne Daly) orders Toomes to shut down his operation, and adds that they will be confiscating all of their findings. Toomes protests and even punches a Damage Control agent when he makes a snide remark to him. Hoag then reasserts her demand to Toomes to give up his work.After learning that Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) is behind Damage Control, Toomes gathers three of his co-workers - Jackson Brice (Logan Marshall-Green), Herman Schultz (Bokeem Woodbine), and Phineas Mason (Michael Chernus) - to continue their work in gathering Chitauri tech regardless of what they are told. Eight years later, Toomes and his guys are still at it, with Toomes using his Vulture suit to bring in a bag of Chitauri power core.Meanwhile, Peter Parker (Tom Holland) is recording a video log as he travels to Berlin with Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) for what is really Tony recruiting Peter to help him during the events of ""Civil War"". Happy shows off the new Spider-Man suit that Tony made for Peter, which he gets super excited about. He later records his fight alongside Iron Man and everyone on his loyalist side during the airport fight against Captain America and the other Avengers. Tony then brings Peter home in his limo, leaving him eager for their next mission.Two months later, Peter is still waiting to hear back from Happy over any new missions. He goes back to being a normal student at Midtown High School. Peter makes plans with his best friend Ned (Jacob Batalon) to build a Lego Death Star. Peter also has a crush on a senior named Liz (Laura Harrier) and is frequently taunted by snotty rich kid Flash Thompson (Tony Revolori). When not at school, Peter continues going around the city as Spider-Man to help people as well as fight crime. Peter refers to his Spidey work as the Stark internship, and as a result, he quits his school\'s decathlon team. While at school, Peter secretly creates new web fluid for his shooters.One night, Spidey catches four crooks with Avengers masks trying to rob a bank using high-tech equipment. Spidey shows up and fights the criminals, until one of them uses a device that emits a powerful blast, blowing up not only the bank, but also the bodega across the street. Spidey rushes over to save the owner of the bodega (and his cat).Peter quietly returns to his room through his window while not trying to let Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) know that he was out. He crawls across the ceiling and comes down to find Ned sitting on his bed, holding the completed Lego Death Star. He drops it and it breaks upon Ned\'s discovery that Peter is Spider-Man. Ned is shocked but also thrilled. Peter forces him to keep it a secret.Peter later goes with May to dinner. May is trying to get the silent Peter, and Peter admits that he\'s been tired out from the ""Stark Internship,"" with May admitting to not being a fan of Stark. They see footage of the bank robbery, and May warns Peter not to go anywhere near that type of chaos in the city.The entire next day at school, Ned asks Peter questions about being Spider-Man. They even watch a PSA from Captain America (Chris Evans) during gym, and Peter briefly mentions fighting him. The boys then hear Liz talking to her friends about how she\'s got kind of a crush on Spider-Man, leading Ned to blurt out in front of everyone that Peter knows Spider-Man. Liz then invites Peter and Ned to a party at her house so that Peter can try to invite Spider-Man.The boys attend the party, and almost instantly, Ned tries to get Peter to change into his Spider-Man outfit. Peter doesn\'t want to until Flash starts pestering him. He goes to change, but then sees an explosion in the distance. He goes to investigate and finds Brice and Schultz selling Chitauri tech to a local gangster named Aaron Davis (Donald Glover). Peter\'s cell goes off when Ned tries to call him, making Brice and Schultz think Aaron was setting them up. Spidey intervenes and tries to fight the crooks. He chases them until Vulture swoops down and grabs Spidey. He drops him into the river as he gets tangled in his parachute. Iron Man then comes down and saves Spidey, finding out where he was because of a tracker in his suit. Tony is not in the suit as he is basically calling Peter, but he tells him to stay out of crime-fighting for his own good. Peter considers returning to the party, but Ned has him hear on the phone that Flash has everyone mocking Peter. Peter then finds a weapon that one of the crooks left behind.At Toomes\'s lair, Brice admits to dropping his weapon as he was using his electric gauntlets (calling himself ""Shocker""). Fed up with Brice\'s carelessness, Toomes cuts him from the team, but Brice threatens to spill their secrets to Toomes\' wife and the public. Toomes responds by grabbing a powerful gun off Mason\'s desk and incinerating Brice with it (mistaking an anti-gravity gun for a laser gun). He then gives Schultz the gauntlets so he can be Shocker.With Ned\'s help, Peter cracks open the weapon to find a power core. He finds Schultz again and places a tracker on him, discovering that he is going to Maryland. To get there, Peter rejoins the decathlon team as they head to D.C. for the Nationals competition.Peter sneaks out and goes to find Schultz as Spider-Man. He catches the villains attempting to hijack a Damage Control truck with more weaponry inside. During his attempt to foil the villains, Spidey is knocked unconscious and wakes up in a Damage Control warehouse, unable to leave because the door is sealed until the morning. Peter talks to the A.I. system in his suit, whom he refers to as Karen (Jennifer Connelly). She helps Peter get a better understanding of how his suit works. He even tells her about his feelings for Liz. He also learns that the power core is basically a bomb that will go off when exposed to radiation. When he realizes he is about to miss the competition, Peter has Karen help him unlock the doors as he rushes to the competition.Peter misses the whole competition, but the team wins thanks to the help of reserved loner Michelle Jones (Zendaya). The team then heads over to the Washington Monument. He calls Ned to warn him about the power core that he was holding, but is unable to get the message through. As Spidey, he rushes to the Monument, but the core goes off in Ned\'s backpack as the team is riding up the elevator. Spidey climbs up the Monument to save the team, but he can\'t get in through the window without using great force. The police arrive in choppers and order Spidey to get to the ground. Against their orders, Spidey leaps over the choppers and swings from the bottom. He breaks in and tries to hold the falling elevator with his web, but the weight pulls him down. He is able to hold the web and the elevator as everyone inside climbs out. Liz is the last person and nearly falls with the elevator but Spidey catches her with the web and rescues her.Back in New York, Karen reveals that the Spider-Man suit records everything that Peter has seen. She gets a visual on Aaron, and Spidey later finds him in a parking garage. He attempts to interrogate him to find out why he was trying to get the tech from Toomes\'s goons. Aaron says he was trying to get them out of his neighborhood. He figures that Spidey is new to being a hero. Aaron tells Spidey that Toomes is meeting to gather more tech at the Staten Island Ferry later that afternoon.On the Ferry, Toomes is meeting with another criminal named Mac Gargan (Michael Mando). Spidey gets a call from Tony, but he lies about what he\'s up to. Spidey spots Schultz on the boat but sees Toomes and doesn\'t realize he is Vulture. He swings in and incapacitates Gargan and his goons. Toomes tries to use a weapon on Spidey, but he holds it down with his webbing. This backfires since the weapon becomes unstable and splits the Ferry in half. Spidey then tries to hold the Ferry together with his webbing, but it\'s not strong enough and it continues to split. As Spidey holds on as much as he can, Iron Man and his little drones show up to put the Ferry back together and save everyone.Spidey retreats to a rooftop. Iron Man finds him and chews him out for not listening to him and lying to him about what he\'s doing with the suit. Peter then attempts to put the blame on Tony for what happened with the Ferry for not listening to him about the Vulture, but Tony steps out of his suit this time and reveals that he DID in fact listen to Peter, as he sent the FBI on the same Ferry that Toomes was on. He goes on to remind Peter that, while nobody got harmed, if somebody did, it would\'ve been on Peter. Feeling that he\'s unworthy of it, Tony demands that Peter give him back the Spidey suit. Peter pleads with Tony, saying that he\'s nothing without the suit, to which Tony says that he doesn\'t deserve it if he\'s nothing without it. Peter is failed to convince Tony to let him stay with the suit. He goes home to Aunt May dejectedly. She gets on him for not answering his phone all day, even going to the police to find out where he was. She also knows about him skipping detention at school earlier that day, that he missed out on the Decathlon competition in Washington, AND he sneaks out out of the house every night. Demanding an explanation, he admits to getting fired from the Internship.Peter resumes his life as a student and spends more time with Ned. Peter finds Liz at school and admits to liking her, which she already knew. He then asks her to the homecoming dance, which she accepts.On the night of the dance, Peter goes to pick up Liz, only to learn that her father is none other than...ADRIAN TOOMES. After some awkward photos, Toomes drives Peter and Liz to the dance. As Liz tells Adrian about Peter\'s background and the events at Washington, he slowly starts putting together the pieces of Peter\'s circumstances and realizes that he\'s Spider-Man. Liz leaves the car, and Toomes quietly threatens Peter by telling him to stay out of his business or else he will kill him and anyone he cares about.During the dance, Peter learns that Toomes plans to steal a shipment of weaponry from a plane coming from the Avengers Tower heading to their new headquarters. Peter ditches Liz and rushes to get his homemade Spider-Man suit to stop Toomes. He heads outside and is attacked by Schultz with his gauntlets. Peter tries to reach his web shooter, but Schultz continues to pummel him. He is saved by Ned, and Peter sticks Schultz to a bus with the webbing.Spidey rushes to stop Toomes with Ned being his eyes and ears. Ned tries to get in touch with Happy, but he doesn\'t care about it and hangs up on him. Spidey finds Toomes in his lair. Toomes attempts to reason with Peter that he\'s only doing what he believes is necessary and that the world isn\'t as black and white as the young Peter believes it to be, but it turns out to be a distraction as Toomes unleashes his suit as it flies around the area, destroying support beams and causing a pile of debris to fall on Spidey. Toomes leaves him to die. Peter struggles to lift the rubble off of him and he fears he is going to die. He then remembers Tony\'s words, he uses all his strength to pull himself out and he\'ll have to do it all alone without Tony\'s help.Spidey latches onto Vulture\'s suit as he intercepts the plane. Toomes tries to gather what he needs, but Spidey foils his plan. Toomes gets in his suit and fights Spidey on the plane. They knock out the turbines, sending the plane toward Coney Island. Spidey is able to maneuver the plane away from the city and onto the beach as it crash-lands. Toomes attempts to get away with the weaponry, but Spidey tries to warn him that they are about to explode. Toomes tries flying away anyway, but the cores blow up and he goes crashing down. Spidey finds Toomes and saves him, but he leaves him next to the rest of the weaponry for Happy and the police to find later, leading to Toomes getting arrested.At school, Peter finds out that Liz is moving to Oregon with her mother while her father is on trial. She is still upset with Peter for leaving her at the dance. She says goodbye to Peter and hopes that he can figure himself out. Peter is back on the decathlon team, and Michelle is made captain. She quickly mentions that her nickname is MJ. Peter then gets a text to go to the bathroom. Happy is there, thanking Peter for what he did. He then tells Peter that Tony wants to see him.Tony and Happy bring Peter to the new Avengers HQ. Tony presents Peter with a brand new Spider-Man suit, telling him that there are reporters behind the wall waiting for a big announcement, meaning Tony is about to officially make Peter a new Avenger. However, Peter turns Tony down, saying he prefers to be a ""friendly neighborhood Spider-Man"" for now. Peter leaves, and asks Tony if he was testing him and whether or not he passed, and Tony seemingly confirms it adding that there are no reporters. However, Tony is actually surprised that Peter made the mature choice of turning him down, and that there really were a bunch of reporters outside. Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) comes out, asking where Peter is. She is frustrated that he walked out, so Happy covers for them by giving Tony a ring so he can propose to Pepper.When Peter gets home, he finds a bag from Tony on his bed. Tony is convinced and has given Peter back the original Spider-Man suit. Peter then proudly puts it on...not realizing Aunt May is behind him, leading her to blurt out ""WHAT THE F--"".Mid-Credits Scene: Toomes is locked up at The Raft and he runs into Gargan, who mentions that he and other criminals are trying to come together to kill Spider-Man. Gargan then reveals that he heard a rumor of Toomes knowing who Spider-Man is. Toomes denies it, saying Spider-Man would already be dead if he knew. He then leaves Gargan to see Liz and his wife visiting him.After-Credits Scene: Captain America shows up in another PSA talking about patience, and how sometimes being patient leads to things that aren\'t worth it. He then asks the off-screen director of the PSAs how many more PSA videos he has to work on.']"

If the humour doesn't click with you, it's pretty much impossible to judge whether the jokes work or not, leaving you with only the story to latch onto. And the story is cliché: Hero doubting, losing or giving up their powers then getting them back. It's a tired and overused trope ever since Superman II. It's not a very good trope either and a lazy way to raise the stakes. I don't know why writers and directors love it so much.

More of the same please.', ""It's hard to know how Thor acolytes will feel about the God of Thunder's latest solo adventure, with New Zealand director Taika Waititi turning the previous Shakespearian meets modern day blockbuster like first two outings on their heads with his laughter focused/80's infused action comedy that is likely to appeal to a broader audience while also alienating some hard-core fans in the process.It's not like Thor from 2011 and Dark World from 2013 are exactly overly well-loved properties, Thor the character finding a broader appeal and resonance in the Avenger films, but Waititi's departure from what has come before is one of the greatest change of paces for a series I've ever seen.Gathering a passionate if small fan base from his work directing films Boy, What We Do in the Shadows and the critical smash Hunt for the Wilderpeople, those that have adored Waititi's work on a small budget will be pleased to know his oddball sense of humour and playful directing is still well and truly in-tact with a Marvel budget behind his every wish and imaginative idea.Barely taking a chance to catch a breath over 2 hours of runtime, Waititi throws the audience headfirst into Thor's newest life or death outing as the muscled god with a freshly minted haircut (courtesy of a particularly excited hairdresser) finds himself trying to escape Sakaar, a planet run by Jeff Goldblum's camp Grandmaster all the while dealing with his dastardly adopted brother Loki, his angry green friend Hulk/Bruce Banner and most pressingly Cate Blanchett's new villainess Hela, who has taken over Thor's home world of Asgard.It's a multi-stranded plot line but it's all there as an excuse and fodder for Waititi to showcase a new side of Thor whose grown into himself and learnt more about the universe from his time on Earth, as well as a reason to team Hemsworth with Mark Ruffaloo's Hulk as the two share a great on screen chemistry as mismatched friends.As to be expected with a Waititi film, the characters and humour are what makes his features resonate with audiences around the world and he gifts Hemsworth his best take on Thor yet while newcomers to the series Tessa Thompson as feisty warrior and likely fan favourite Valkyrie, Waitit himself doing the voice of rock fighter Korg, Goldblum as Grandmaster and Blanchett as lead antagonist Hela all fair well, clearly having a blast with Waititi's wacky and often inventive situations and executions.As fun and visually captivating as most of Waititi's movie is, Ragnarok still struggles to bring the narrative arc of the story full circle and with Waititi still undoubtedly needing to mould his film into what lays ahead for the Marvel universe, as a whole the final section of the film suffers from a rather forgettable and bland finishing act that feels incredibly lacklustre to what has come before it.Caught up also with the arc of Thor being on Sakaar, Waititi struggles to make the most of Blanchett's Hela and her whole period on Asgard never really gets out of first gear and it becomes an arguable statement that perhaps Waititi took on board to much at once and sections of the film feel the pressure from so many things going on at once.Final Say – Ragnarok is Thor gone wild, a film that's an over the top colourful mash-up of 80's stylings, action tics while on a constant search for the next punch-line.A Marvel experience that will once more light up the international box office and become a quick-fire audience favourite, there's not a lot of lasting appeal to Waititi's film other than the likelihood of it being a guilty pleasure of the Marvel film series but it's one of the years silliest and sensory overloading blockbusters that provides a great bang for your buck adventure and more laughs in a single scene than most mainstream comedies could conjure up in an entire runtime.3 ½ eager hairdresser's out of 5"", ""Ragnarok has such a different feel to it to the previous Thor movies and it was a move in the right direction. Thor is easily more likeable under the direction of Taika Waititi. He was able to make sure that no one was taking themselves too seriously. The use of music was epic, especially the heavy rock at the beginning and end of the movie.Korg was such a funny character. I've loved every character that Taika has played in all his movies, and Korg is high up there. He does so much for his few scenes. Thor vs Hulk was also a fantastic scene. Such good humour. There was a nice touch of having two antagonists with Jeff Goldblum and Cate Blanchett each with seperate motivations made a more interesting story other than good versus evil.Great to see a few kiwis brought along with Taika with strong performances from Karl Urban and Rachel House.The only loop hole in the movie for me was the fact the Thor could destory Surtur the fire monster at the beginning of the movie. But then Hela could easily destory Thor but then couldn't equally destory Surtur? This seemed confusing and we're left to put the pieces together to accept this is ok because Surtur grew much stronger (and bigger) by being born again with the eternal flame and also he grows through being in Asgard.Great work from Taika again and great to see the kiwi humour being on the big screen."", 'The cast for Thor Ragnarok are all matched well, and the sibling chemistry between Tom Hiddleston and Chris Hemsworth is as natural as can be. Cate Blanchett as Hela, the goddess of death is frightening in her cruelty as well as physical perfection. But, the reason this movie stands alone is the multi talented Taika Waititi, the director of the film. His offbeat New Zealand style shows in every scene, humor throughout and a rocking 80s electronica soundtrack, the film will transport you as fast as Heimdall and the Bitfrost!', 'When the long-banished, not-known-to-exist first-born of Odin(Hopkins, whose parody of himself, as well as his somber take, are both great), his daughter Hela(Blanchett, delicious, loving every moment, and making for another one of the few and far between deeply memorable villains of the franchise) returns to Asgard, her tremendous powers and thirst for conquest mean Thor(Hemsworth going for dry, sarcastic wit, and it works) and Loki(yet again in a new personal situation with his family, albeit overall, he does little to affect what happens) have to stop her. However, they\'re stuck in Sakaar, prisoners of the dictator The Grandmaster(Goldblum, with his charm turning threatening from one second to the next). And then our titular hero is made to fight the gladiatorial champion – The Hulk(Ruffalo getting to expand the role\'s vocabulary, personality, and tragedy/pathos – albeit not far enough. It doesn\'t extend to properly exploring what he\'s been doing, fighting beings no match for him, previously invariably to the death, despite him leaving Earth was literally specifically to flee this exact thing. They stopped short of where the comic went with it, sadly. The supporting players are appreciated, though).This trilogy has gotten a lot of criticism from the onset, some of it deserved, a lot of it borne out of the natural difficulties with making this kind of world work, especially within the gritty, realistic one Iron Man set up. In this entry, Earth is nearly completely absent, and certainly the only human who has screen-time is Dr. Strange, who is also ""beyond"". Yes, Jane Foster, Darcy and Erik Selvig are gone. Broken up off-screen. I hate that. However, with this newfound freedom, this goes full cosmic. The tone approaches Guardians of the Galaxy. It\'s superior to Vol. 2, but not up to the level of the original. Honestly, a few minor things seem to be there specifically to redo that, and they\'d be better left on the cutting room floor. The jokey subversion/drama mix is not as strong as that, nor of the third Robert Downey Jr. solo picture. With that said, relatively little of the actual weight is lost to laughs. This still has gravity and tension. The action is fast, frequent and enjoyable, if also by far the most MCU aspect of this. Many will find this to be bland, not fun, a corporate product. Certainly, there\'s still a lot of room for diversity and flavor. Fingers crossed that Black Panther will push the envelope there.I recommend this to anyone who finds the trailers appealing. You can go into this completely blind. Stay through the credits. 8/10', ""I literally walked out of my living room. It's just boring. They could've done so much better but it's corny and just straight up boring. No action whatsoever and lame pre-school jokes."", ""Thor Ragnarok is an amazing weird well made and action parked movie. Ragnarok is definite the best Thor movie to date. The whole atmosphere of the movie is is wacky and weird but with the same Marvel feel we all love. The characters new and old really shine along with the locations and sets. The villain Hela is also great in the movie and recreation rally adds to movie as a whole whole also adding to list list of great casting choices by Marvel. To summarize Thor Ragnarok is Marvel's best Thor movie to date with its dry humour and its weird and wacky tones."", ""Being the 17th instalment into the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), and the third in the solo-Thor series—generally the least liked within the MCU—it wouldn't be surprising if this cosmic adventure showed signs of repetition and fatigue. It doesn't, not one bit. The opposite is true in fact, thanks to the unique energy and ingenuity brought from New Zealand director Taika Waititi (Hunt for the Wilderpeople, What We Do in the Shadows). Waititi's comedy background is noticeably in full swing, the previously darker Thor outings traded in for a laugh-heavy vibe closer to Guardians of the Galaxy – the movie Ragnarok shares top spot with, as the MCU's funniest film. A throwaway gag about scissors from a side character made of rock (mo-capped and viced by the director himself) is pure Waititi, and the franchise's best one-liner since Chris Pratt's Starlord appreciated the artwork of Jackson Pollock. Of course a big budget means big action, and there's plenty here to thrill and delight: a tone-setting smack down of a fiery underworld demigod, a bruising gladiatorial contest between Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), an exhilarating spaceship chase, and the breathtakingly electric finale. This threequel is visually distinct too, Waititi opting for a grungy-disco 80s atmosphere over the more theatrical opulence of the first two Thor flicks. His use of slow-mo, backed to Led Zeppelin's 'Immigrant Song', for two key moments, is simply brilliant. Supporting Hemsworth, who has never been better as the macho God of Thunder, is Tom Hiddleston as fan favourite bad-good guy Loki, Cate Blanchett as the sneering God of Death Hela, Tessa Thompson as the cocky warrior Valkyrie and Jeff Goldblum as the eccentric Grandmaster, plus a raft of awesome cameos. A few minor nit picks: Idris Elba seems bored as the returning Heimdall, two previous major supporting characters (both females) are conspicuously absent, a talking Hulk doesn't quite work, and the narrative-retcon work could've been more subtle. But when a movie is this damn entertaining, a few quibbles are easily forgiven. Comfortably taking its place in the top echelon of MCU films, Thor: Ragnarok is hilarious, invigorating and popcorn-blockbustering of the highest order."", ""Thor: Ragnarok, directed by Taika Waititi, created this breath of fresh air, being undoubtedly, the best installment to the Thor series. You can tell that Taika had a great respect and bond with the returning cast members, seamlessly working together on this exciting tale. Waititi did an amazing job adapting his multi-genre style into this film, but the fact that he tried to keep it in continuity with the Marvel style, it didn't really fit all that well; If Waititi made this film with strictly his style, it would've paid off better, grasping what made Guardians of the Galaxy a great film.Even though Waititi played things a little safe, while the premise is overused and predictable, he brilliantly switched up the whole narrative, doing his best to make this an original and entertaining film. Thor: Ragnarok, was so much fun, while really embracing the weirdness the saga poses. The film flows at such a brisk pace, that can be laidback at times, while having so many memorable moments. Waititi created this film to be more of a comedy-based film, but the other darker tones he incorporated worked pretty well, although some of the dramatic scenes were played off a little light.Thor: Ragnarok stands out so much because of the characters! Sarah Finn did another amazing job casting this huge talent! You can genuinely tell that everyone was having a good time, which translates to great performances across the board! Chris Hemsworth is a stud! He brings so much wit, humor, and heart to the Thor character, being able to create chemistry with anyone! The writers gave him everything he needed to make his character more likable, while giving him some nice character development. We finally get to see Mark Ruffalo back in action as Bruce Banner and The Hulk, and he absolutely steals every scene that he's in! Ruffalo was born to play this character! He brings a tremendous likability to the character, bringing so much wit, and subtle humor, to give his character more great layers! Ruffalo can fit any scheme that he's thrown into, being such an enjoyable presence everytime. Tessa Thompson gets thrown into the MCU mix, and she is another one that fits the scheme like a glove! She is such a fantastic addition to the saga, while putting on such a natural performance, here. Tom Hiddleston returns as Loki, but he doesn't have too much to do in the film, because of his antics in the past. Believe it or not, he is more mellowed out, and grounded this time around, also having some nice character development. One of the most favorable additions to the film, was Korg, voiced by Taika Waititi. He didn't have much to do up until the end of the third act, but he was just an enjoyable presence, having some great jokes along the way! Karl Urban as Skurge, was fine, but he wasn't one of those characters that needed to be there, especially due to the fact that he's just a jerk. Urban definitely made the best out of his screen time, having a few decent moments, but he isn't the most memorable out of the cast. You probably wouldn't expect to see Jeff Goldblum in the MCU, but him as The GrandMaster was awesome! The way his character was written was perfect for the tone of the film! Even though he didn't have a whole lot of screen time, he made the absolute most of it! Cate Blanchett may have overcooked her performance a tad, but she was still great as Hela. She is one of the better villains of the MCU, having a good motive, and connection to Thor and Loki. One of my only issues with Hela, she could've been fleshed out better, instead of throwing a lot of exposition at us. There is a lot to be explored about her character, so it's understandable to an extent, but it left her character to be a little boring, at times.The screenplay by Craig Kyle, Christopher Yost, and Eric Pearson, had a lot of good pieces of writting, with a great flow and timing, but some of the dramatic aspects were cut a little thin, due to the comedy-heavy genre. The film would've benefited if they would've cut back on the comedy just a little bit, to tighten up the emotional and dramatic aspects; other than that, there isn't much to complain about.The production of this film was gorgeous! There were so many beautiful colors, with unique world designs. The effects of the film weren't the best it could've been, but it worked a lot better than something like Black Panther. The action of the film was one of the best aspects, being well balanced, well shot, and really entertaining! The score and soundtrack wasn't the orthodox score from the MCU films; Waititi and Mark Mothersbaugh incorporated this rock anthem, and it just worked perfectly!Overall, Thor: Ragnarok is one of my personal favorite MCU films. Even though this blast of fun comes with issues, Thor: Ragnarok belongs close to the top of your list!"", 'Marvel Studios\' Thor: Ragnarok is packed full of ""unthorgetable"" fun and exciting depth as part of one unforgettable saga. The film excels in its humour, with some scenes that deliver emotional moments with the complex relationship with brother, half-brother, and father (Thor, Loki, Odin) and a satisfying friendship with both the God of Thunder and the ""big guy,"" the tremendous, loveable Incredible Hulk. The story itself is brilliantly created also. Without Thor\'s hammer, according to reviews, he is ""still worthy.""As the movie continues to strive in it\'s action, comedy, and the story, it certainly beats the opportunities of what Thor: The Dark World tried to conquer, and with it\'s threequel, characters like Heimdell get more shine until he is killed off by the Mad Titan (Thanos) in Marvel Studios\' Avengers: Infinity War. From there on, it excels with the fascinating and well-created atmosphere of worlds such as Asgard, like it\'s predecessors, and the newly garbage planet Sakaar. The Hulk, after a few years of being absent from piloting the Quinjet in Marvel Studios\' Avengers: Age Of Ultron, performs a top-notch portrayal with more of a humanised version, both he and the Mighty Thor are fantastic!The ending sets the stakes high with Infinity War just right round the corner, it gives fans the story and the performance what they deserve. This movie, as a whole, is funny, intriguingly emotional, and a likeable candidate to the MCU saga.A 9/10 to the Asgardians, to the big green guy, to the Sakaar people, and to the filmmakers behind this movie, ""because that\'s what directors do.""', ""A lot of fun, action and... what else? Everything? I love it! If you don't like humour, if you think that heroes have to be serious, then this movie is not for you, you would be totally disappointed and you would give a low score, just because of your anger. This is a movie to spend a couple of hours without thinking... the real life will be coming soon... enjoy this time!"", 'I\'m neither a Marvel fan, nor (in particular) a Thor fan\x85.. but I have to admit ""Thor: Ragnarok"" was brilliant from beginning to end. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) has been travelling the universe in search of\x85 stuff\x85 (I neither remember nor care)\x85 but returns to his home planet of Asgard with a dire warning of impending \'Raganrok\': this being the \'End of Days\' for Asgard. But he finds the court engaged in serious leisure time!Things go from bad to worse when Hela (Cate Blanchett, ""Carol"") – someone with more than a passing relationship to Thor – arrives with a mission to assume the throne. Teamed uncomfortably with half-brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston, ""High Rise""), the brothers get cast millions of light years away to a planet lorded over by a \'grand master\' (a lovely performance, that I will leave anonymous here) who pits new gladiators in an arena against his latest champion. You\'ll never guess who his champion is? Well, OK (cos the trailer gives it away)\x85 he\'s big and green! The film\'s script is hilarious. It generates an enormous volume of entertainment with laugh-out loud moments throughout; the unforeseen involvement of other Marvel characters; some startling cameos all mixed with the usual brand of spectacular fights and action. Some of the action is surprising: a real eye-opener you might say.The lead cast (Hemsworth, Hiddleston, Blanchett and Ruffalo) all perform admirably and are joined by heavyweight cameos from Anthony Hopkins (""Westworld"") and Idris Elba (""Bastille Day"") reprising their roles from ""Thor: The Dark World"". Particularly impressive is Tessa Thompson (""Creed"") as Thor\'s Valkyrie warrior side-kick and Karl Urban (""Star Trek: Into Darkness"") as the turn-coat Asgardian Skurge.Directed by young New Zealander Taika Waititi (behind last year\'s successful indie hit ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"") it\'s a breath of fresh air for the Thor franchise, more similar to the style of ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" rather than the previous films in the series. Waititi also saves all the best comedy lines for himself as the \'rock warrior\' character Korg: his New Zealand twang delivering just side- splitting dialogue. As with most Marvel films, its a little bit flabby in places, running to 130 minutes: some of the dialogue, particularly scenes between Hemsworth and Ruffalo, feel like they needed tightening up in the editing suite. This time of course includes the scrolling of endless teams of visual effect artists in the closing titles which – naturally – 90% of the audience stay for to see if there are any ""monkeys"". In fact,there are two: one fairly early on; the other right at the end. (To be honest, I thought neither of them was particularly worth waiting for). However overall the movie is highly recommended for a fun night out at the cinema. By the way, this is a film best viewed cold\x85 if someone tries to tell you the surprises, cut them off quick!(Thor (sic) the full graphical review, please visit bob-the-movie- man.com. Thanks!).', ""The story opens about two years after the events in 'Avengers: Age of Ultron'. Thor (Chris Hemsworth), having failed in his quest to locate the Infinity Stones and having also been dumped by Jane (although he insists it was a 'mutual dumping') is hanging in chains above a fire pit before being brought before the monstrous fire demon Surtur. Surtur believes his destiny is to bring about Ragnarok, the complete destruction of Asgard. Thor learns from Surtur that Odin (Anthony Hopkins) is not on Asgard, so uses Mjolnir (his hammer) to escape and destroy Surtur, keeping his crown/skull, the demon's power source. Thor returns to Asgard and sends Surtur's skull down to the vaults but then finds Heimdall (Idris Elba) has been replaced as sentry of the Bifrost Bridge by the inept Skurge (Karl Urban) who explains that Odin accused Heimdall of treachery. Heimdall subsequently fled and his whereabouts are unknown.Reaching Asgard, Thor sees a massive statue of Loki (Tom Hiddleston) as well as Odin lounging around, enjoying a play about Loki's 'heroic sacrifice' while fighting the Dark Elves. Realizing what's happened, Thor quickly forces Loki (who usurped and disguised himself as Odin prior to the end of 'Thor: The Dark World') to drop his charade and demands to know what happened to Odin. It is revealed that Loki had placed Odin under a spell and dumped him in a retirement home in New York City. By the time they get there it is being demolished. Before they can plan their next move, Loki is suddenly pulled through a dimensional hole in the sidewalk and a card with an address (177a Bleecker St) is left behind. Thor goes there and finds Doctor Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), the mystic guardian of Earth, who agrees to help him find Odin on the condition that all Asgardians leave Earth. Thor agrees, and after doing some research (during which Thor is constantly teleported around Strange's Sanctum, a disorienting experience) Doctor Strange deduces that Odin is in Norway. He then releases Loki from his endless fall, and when Loki tries to attack an exasperated Strange, the doctor unceremoniously sends them both through another portal.They find Odin in Norway sitting near a scenic cliff (having shaken off Loki's spell) and he admits that he is dying and Ragnarok is approaching. Thor insists that when he destroyed Surtur, he prevented Ragnarok. Odin mentions Hela (Cate Blanchett), his true first-born child, the goddess of death and the one who will seize Asgard from Odin's sons. Odin tells Thor and Loki that their (previously unknown) sister was completely consumed by darkness and was sealed away, the only force that continues her exile is Odin himself. He apologizes to Thor for failing him before dying and disappearing. As soon as he's gone, Hela emerges from her prison and engages the two in brief small talk. Seeing that she won't be reasoned with, Thor throws Mjolnir towards her however the goddess easily catches and effortlessly shatters the long-indestructable weapon. Loki, seeing they don't stand a chance, asks to be returned to Asgard via the Bifrost, however Hela also enters the portal, expels Loki and then Thor from it at different points and reaches Asgard. Arriving at the Bifrost Bridge, she quickly kills Volstagg (Ray Stevenson) and Fendral (Zachary Levi) before recruiting a terrified Skurge to her cause. She then heads to Asgard when she kills the entire palace guard single-handedly as well as Hogun (Tadanobu Asano).Thor is deposited by the portal on a planet, Sakaar, which seems to consist entirely of gigantic garbage mounds, fed by giant portals in the skies. He's attacked by several scavengers. Now weapon-less, he is quickly overpowered before his attackers are scared off by the hard-drinking bounty hunter Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson). However she then captures Thor, placing a small shocking device on his neck to pacify him, and takes him to the Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum) who is delighted with his newest acquisition and decides to put him up against his champion fighter. Thor learns that Loki is also present and has been there for weeks (time moving far quicker on the Grandmaster's planet) during which he has found favor with the Grandmaster. Not wishing to jeopardize his position, Loki pretends not to care about his brother and Thor is thrown in the dungeons where he befriends rock-creature Korg who explains that all who have gone up against the champion have been killed. Meanwhile, Hela enters Asgard's throne room and pulls down the fresco above the throne depicting Odin and the royal family and their benevolent rule of their kingdom and the universe, revealing the darker history of Asgard where Odin and Hela conquered the Nine Realms before she was banished by her father. Hela then heads down to Asgard's vaults and uses Asgard's Eternal Flame to restore her entire army and revive her monstrous wolf, Fenris. (She also dismisses the Infinity Gauntlet that is kept there as a fake). She then attempts to open a portal and conquer all the realms but the Bifrost sword has been taken by Heimdall who has been hiding in the hills and is now sheltering the escaping civilians from Asgard.Thor is taken to the arena and put up against the champion who is revealed to be none other than the Incredible Hulk. Thor is overjoyed to see his old teammate, however the Hulk attacks him. The two bash each other around the area, Thor gaining the upper hand. He tries using Natasha Romanov's calming technique to make him transform back into Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) however it doesn't work and Hulk thrashes him (Loki is very unsettled to again see the creature that gave him a sound beating during his attempted conquest of Earth). Eventually Thor stops holding back and begins to fight, at one point having a vision of Odin causing him to channel raw lightning. However just when he is about to win the Grandmaster, not wanting to see a crowd (and his own) favorite be beaten, shocks Thor into submission. As the Hulk leaps into the air to crush Thor, Thor puts his hand up in defense before everything goes black.On Asgard, Hela has the remaining people rounded up and demands to know where the Bifrost sword is. When no-one comes forward, Hela tells Skurge to execute a random person. Skurge hesitates, but is still about to do it, but before he can make the kill someone comes forward with Heimdall's location.Thor wakes up later in the Hulk's chamber, being pampered by several beautiful women. Thor speaks to Hulk privately (Hulk is now able to speak far more intelligently than he was able to in his last appearance) and learns that he hasn't transformed back into Banner since leaving Earth two years earlier. The Hulk points out that the Quinjet he left Earth with is still in one piece and could be used to escape. He also learns that Valkyrie is an Asgardian who was part of an elite all-female group who were sent up against Hela during her previous assault but were all killed (Valkyrie being the only survivor). Thor tries to convince her to help, but she initially refuses. Although Hulk is happy in his life and wants to stay, he does help Thor acquire the control device for his electronic restraint -- Thor pickpockets it from Valkyrie and removes the shocker from his neck. Thor escapes from Hulk's apartment and reaches the Quinjet, but is chased by Hulk who smashes it half apart. However Thor then plays Black Widow's (Scarlett Johansson) last message to him, prompting the Hulk to transform back into Bruce Banner. Thor explains to Banner, whose last memories are of Sokovia during Ultron's offensive, what has happened. Banner, unable to believe Hulk was able to remain in control for two years, doesn't want to transform again knowing that if he does he might remain the Hulk forever. Valkyrie meets up with Loki and the two engage in a brief fight, and after Loki learns where she comes from he uses his powers to make her remember her last encounter with Hela. Valkyrie has a change of heart and she decides to help Thor return to Asgard, and shows her good will by beating and chaining up Loki. Reuniting, Thor and Loki head down to steal a ship however Loki attempts to betray Thor to the Grandmaster. Thor, expecting such a move by Loki, places the shocking device onto Loki's back. Thor tells his brother he'd hoped he would at least show some capacity for growth and even begin to change for the better, but now he understands Loki will always be a trickster. He then leaves the shocking device turned on with the remote just out of reach.Thor, Banner and Valkyrie steal the Grandmaster's party/orgy ship and, escaping the Grandmaster's clutches, leave through a passageway known as the Devil's Anus. Reaching Asgard just as Hela is about to destroy the remaining population who had attempted to escape through the Bifrost Bridge, Thor engages her in a vicious battle but is still overpowered and loses an eye. Feeling he is useless without his hammer, Thor has a vision of Odin who explains to his son that the hammer simply channeled his powers, reminding him he is the God of Thunder. Odin also tells him that Asgard is not a place but it's people and they can re-establish their society and culture anywhere. Now realizing his full abilities, Thor unleashes a massive lightning bolt repelling Hela. As Valkyrie and Heimdall attempt to hold off Hela's army, Loki unites with Korg and other escaping fighters and procures a ship which he uses to evacuate the Asgardians. Banner also transforms back into Hulk to fight off Fenris. Skurge, feeling guilt over having allied himself with Hela, sacrifices himself to ensure the ship is able to escape.Thor unites with Valkyrie and Loki knowing Hela will soon be back as she is only growing stronger from Asgard's power. Thor suddenly realizes that he cannot stop Ragnarok but must instead bring it about to defeat Hela, and sends Loki down to the vaults to throw Surtur's skull into the Eternal Flame. Loki does so and escapes (it's also heavily implied that he takes the chance to steal the Tessaract) just as Surtur is resurrected and starts laying waste to the kingdom. Hela mounts an offense but it is little use -- Surtur is too powerful and destroys her with his sword. Thor escapes with Loki, Hulk, Heimdall, Valkyrie, Korg and the surviving civilians/prisoners just before Asgard is completely decimated. Although Thor is upset about the destruction of his home, he knows it was necessary to prevent the extinction of his people. He then finally meets his destiny and takes the 'throne' (the captain's chair on the bridge) where his first order is to return to Earth.Mid-Credits Scene:Loki worries over Thor's decision to return to Earth knowing he won't be very welcome there since on his last visit he tried to take over the planet. Thor assures his brother he feels everything will be fine, just as a menacing ship that dwarfs their own appears through the window.Post-Credits Scene:The Grandmaster, who had been chasing Thor, crashes on the garbage planet where he is confronted by the scavengers who are also a bunch of former slaves. He congratulates them on their revolt and agrees to call it a tie.""]"
44,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Black Panther,1825683,"['I am no expert on Marvel comics nor superhero movies. And, I also must admit that I don\'t watch all that many superhero movies any more because the genre has become too glutted for my taste. I mention all this up front because my opinions doubtless will not be of the diehard fans out there...and I can respect this and understand my insights are not necessarily of the majority of viewers of ""Black Panther"".So why, then, did I choose to watch this film when I am rather tired of these films? Well, because ""Black Panther"" is so radically different from other superhero/Marvel films...reason enough to give it a try.The story is set, in part, in the fictional kingdom of Wakanda in Africa. To the outside world, it\'s a third world place...poor, uncivilized and backward. However, this is all a ruse, as long ago, the Wakandans received a great gift...Vibranium. This is apparently the world\'s strongest metal (Captain America\'s shield, incidentally, is made from it)...and it also has some magical properties.As for Wakanda\'s kings, for many generations they\'ve chosen to maintain this ruse. And, this includes staying out of foreign affairs...which is the big struggle in the film. Should Wakanda allow Africans and black people around the world to be exploited as they have for centuries OR should they use their advanced weaponry and Vibranium to conquer the world for a greater good? Much of the film concerns this power struggle for the throne and the hearts and minds of Wakandans.The plot is amazingly fresh and unusual...a major plus in the film. It also is never dull! But it also is incredibly violent and parents might want to think before allowing kids to see the movie. It is odd that the film is rated PG-13 mostly because there is no nudity but the violence level is intense to say the least. Overall, despite this violence it\'s well worth seeing and is a nice break from the usual Marvel stories.', ""Wanted to see 'Black Panther' for a while, one of my most anticipated films of this early half of 2018 and as somebody who likes to loves most of Marvel's films. The idea was interesting as was what the film was hyped up to be, the trailer looked great and the high ratings and critical acclaim promised even more. My thoughts were that 'Black Panther' was a decent and intriguing film with a lot of very well done to great elements, but it didn't blow me away and left me disappointed after the hype. As indicated, far from hated it, didn't love it. Actually saw 'Black Panther' on opening weekend in a sold out showing (it was touch and go as to whether a ticket could be gotten), but had to properly form my thoughts for a while and was nervous seeing the very divisive IMDb reaction and the condescension on both sides (mostly negative), which has slightly died down since to feel less nervous.Starting with the good/great things, 'Black Panther' is mostly impressive visually. The special effects were variable, but there were some spectacular ones, while it's beautifully and stylishly shot, slickly edited and sumptuously costumed. It's the extraordinary production design that was most note-worthy. Loved the use of technology, which was really cool. The music has the right amount of haunting intensity, energy, dignity and pathos, so a fine score on its own but not always utilised right in the film, a few ill-fitting moments mood-wise.Much of the action is exciting, though there could have been more, and there is a good deal of thought-provoking script-writing with some nicely injected humour. One is immersed in the world of Wakanda, which is a fascinating world in thematic terms. The story does grip once it gets going and doesn't feel as confused and jumpy, with timeline and location changes needing to be clearer, like it did to begin with and a lot of it even when turning our everyday struggles on their heads is surprisingly relevant. Personally thought that much of the acting was good, with a very charismatic lead performance from Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan bringing a self-loathing conflicted edge and swagger to Killmonger and Andy Serkis relishing his role with aplomb. The women are just as good, with a dignified Lupita Nyong'o, regal, no-nonsense and feisty Danai Gurira and particularly a funny and endearing Letitia Wright. While his role is small, Daniel Kaluuya is great fun in it. Direction is above competent, if not innovative, and really appreciated the film making Killmonger more than the standard Marvel villain, here one with questionable personal motives but one where one can see his point of view and empathise. Although his actions are inconsistent and don't always make sense and he could have been more threatening, generally he is one of the better Marvel villains and the most developed character in a film too full of stock ones (the titular character being the other exception). 'Black Panther' has faults however. Most of the characters are stock and clichéd, while some of the first half is too talky, the film is a little slow-going and confused to start with and some of the political elements are laid on too thick. Adding to the general feel that, even with the splashes of humour, the film takes itself too seriously and with the amount of predictability it has doesn't do enough new with a novel concept. There are exceptions to the cast. Forrest Whittaker is wasted as a non-developed character with too short screen time, on top of the scene being rushed his final scene has no impact as a result. Martin Freeman is too fish out of water as well. Although some of the effects are spectacular, others are very ropy. Especially in the final action scene between Black Panther and Killmonger which resembled a very early days/years video game. That scene also felt rushed, sometimes vaguely choreographed and anti-climactic, though the whole climax felt over-stuffed and too busy. Overall, decent and interesting but was expecting more. Personally don't think it's the best Marvel film, while a long way from bad let alone terrible, for me it's one of the weaker ones. 6/10 Bethany Cox"", ""Chadwick Boseman who played a pair of real live black icons and played them well makes a reappearance as T'Changa whom we met in Captain American Civil War. Jackie Robinson and Thurgood Marshall should only have had the superpowers this guy has. Including a mysterious mineral that gives those who use it some real staying power. Kind of like kryptonite.With technological advances we can sure do more with these superheroes than could have been done in Hollywood's golden era. But I think the real reason these films are so popular is that real life isn't providing us with that many heroes to admire. Sure easier to root for Marvel Comics creation.Anyway Boseman's father died and being the crown prince he's the logical successor. But in the hidden kingdom of Wakanda you can get challenged. Something like the way the Klingons choose their leader. Boseman defeats one challenger, but another one, an exile raised in the mean streets of Oakland played by Michael B. Jordan emerges and he takes over for a bit. Boseman is down, but not out.Kids and Trekkie types will certainly love this. Not my particular cup of tea, but it's nicely done and packaged.The only question I have is that if these Wakandans are as powerful as they are, why weren't the first Arab slave traders repelled let alone European buyers? Seems like that was the time to make their presence known."", ""BLACK PANTHER is well known as the first Marvel film featuring a black superhero, well supported by an almost all-black cast. Whether it stands up on its own as a decent film is another matter, however. In fact, I found this quite sloppy at times, despite all of the effort and talent involved with its conception. I liked the idea of the hidden African kingdom well enough, although too much time is spent on set up and I think they should have just hit the ground running as they've done in other Marvel movies.The film is replete with action scenes, from hand-to-hand combat to a big car chase through the streets of Busan. The cast put in assured performances and can't really be faulted either. However, I was expecting more from the special effects, which aren't so special at times; the climactic scenes of the fighting rhinoceri reminded me unfavourably of the STAR WARS prequels at times. The writing is also a mixed bag, moving smoothly in Bond-style man-on-a-mission scenes but otherwise stalling, never quite achieving the gravitas it so desperately wants. It feels very much like Marvel knew they were taking a gamble with this one, so tried very hard to please everybody, but the end result is merely perfunctory."", 'To the outside world, Wakanda is a poor, isolated, reclusive kingdom in the center of Africa. In reality, it is a technologically advanced nation of five tribes through its use of vibranium from a crashed meteor. T\'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) returns home to take over the throne after the death of his father in Civil War. He is after arms dealer Ulysses ""Klaw"" Klaue who had previously stolen vibranium and caused mass Wakandan deaths. Klaw is working with Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) who seems to have intimate knowledge of Wakanda. In 1992 Oakland, the former king killed his brother who assisted Klaw during the heist.Arguably, the MCU is the top box office franchise of today and it\'s nice for them to spread their influences into other niches of cinema. This is tackling some cultural aspects within the MCU superhero structure. All that is admirable but the question remains whether this is any good. The answer is that it\'s plenty good. First, Boseman is exceptional and projects a regal personality. The villains are great although I don\'t see the need of Killmonger working for Klaw. He should be killing him at first sight. There are a few things that concern me. The final battle feels obligational due to the superhero structure. The other great aspect is the women of Wakanda. They are all great. I also like the humor sprinkled among the action. It\'s not jokey but actually funny. The MCU is hitting on all cylinders and this is another solid hit.', 'I don\'t have a comic book background (well I did sixty years ago), so I go into these films without predispositions. This was highly touted because of the title black superhero. And so I embraced it because I like it when barriers are broken. The problem was that the thing was convoluted and endless. I stayed with it to the bitter end but found little to make it unique among its Marvel brotherhood. If anything, it pulled in every cliche one could think of, having a black hero. Maybe the producers will learn from this and bring the guy back. By the way, it didn\'t deserve all those ""One"" ratings. There were some incredible scenes. It just didn\'t meld.', 'My desire was to love it. I am not fan of Marvel universe, I am not admire the action films, I am loyal to classic mythologies. And I do not believe in the need of artistic films to be , in obvious and almost agressive manner, political manifesto. ""Black Panther"" has a virtue- the cast. In few cases - the performances. But its fundamental sin is the high ambition to impress its audience. And it does it. But not always inspired. It is an impressive film, no doubt. But, maybe writing the bad word, it is...too impressive. It is more an eccentric show than a reasonable film. Sure, it must be a blockbuster and I am happy for its succes to the young public. But, it could be better . Maybe because it has the right actors and the spider - story could be more reasonable. Off course, I am too subjective and too old for understand the noble intentions and the high virtues behind the each scene. But I feel it , with regret, as almost...racist film. Because the political corectness has its limits. This film looks to be an exception. It is not.', '""Black Panther"" is a new American movie that makes it quite comfortably past the 2-hour mark and here we have the most recent addition to the Marvel universe as in the face of the topic of racism that is still oh so dominant (really more than it should be as we are living in very tolerant times) we get the first Black superhero movie in a long time. Ryan Coogler directs and he is also part of the writing squad. I would say that by including a main antagonist here that is also Black they took some racial tension out here, but if you look at the political history of America and the Black Panthers, it may not be the wisest move to go with this animal. Besides, I felt there was far from sufficient elaboration why they did. The dream sequence with the father being a panther now that he is dead alone wasn\'t enough for sure. Another slightly controversial decision that the main antagonist is an American megalomaniac was not the most sensitive either. But luckily, there are also enough positive things to mention here. Technically, the film is on a pretty high level in terms of sound and visual effects, there is no reason to say it isn\'t on par with other Marvel stuff from recent history. Also the film shows that you don\'t need characters from previous Marvel films to succeed the way they included Hulk most recently in Thor 3. And Boseman in the lead does a pretty good job like everybody else almost, certainly better than Cumberbatch for example. The one exception here is Kaluuya whose character did almost nothing for me and whose performance rang pretty false too on several occasions. The one who made up for that was Andy Serkis, who was great fun to watch and perhaps the best thing about the movie, one of not too many white performers here, who were mostly included for comedic (not entirely) situations. This description also fits Martin Freeman\'s role and he was the same as usual sadly, but luckily his material was good without being too challenging, so it worked. Not the Freeman you\'d expect in this film though, is he?From the Black cast, a special mention goes out to Winston Duke who was really hilarious and makes the most of the little (screen time) he was given here. His cannibalism/vegetarianism joke was perhaps the best (recurring) joke the entire film had to offer. Michael B. Jordan was a good main antagonist I think, even if he seemed a bit insignificant early on, but that\'s okay. He sure is no Andy Serkis. The film\'s weakest moment was the epilogue that we got here the way we got it in every Marvel movie where we have the King tell the press that his country will no longer ignore global conflicts and this went entirely against everything before that as one of the key messages here was that they do not want to be involved while the bad guy wants to use the country\'s ressources to dominate the world. It was simply wrong. Obviously this was done so that they could include Black Panther in other upcoming Marvel films like the next Avengers movie, but probably others as well. Very cheap and if that\'s one of the things you remember the most when leaving the theater, then that is almost a negative deal-breaker. But luckily most of what we saw earlier was good enough, especially the shots at comedy that never felt as wrong or try-hard as in an Iron Man film (sorry RDJ), for me to still recommend the watch here. There are nonetheless serious issues here like the way the protagonist recovers so unrealistically quickly after his defeat and honestly this really felt like taken from Batman\'s conflict with Bane and he cannot defeat the bad guy at the peak of his physical fitness before that, but then he wins afterward after being in a coma recently? Nah guys. The female amazon tribe story added nothing for me either. So overall, realism, authenticity and convincing character elaborations are an issue here and the final scene in America about that apartment felt really try-hard in making a political impact and the film is never as touching or politically relevant from the contemporary perspective as it wants to be, but it is like other recent Marvel films okay from the pointless fun perspective. I give it a thumbs-up. Worth checking out, but not a must-see by any means.', ""Marvel Films have their formula down to a fine art. Even their lesser known heroes are making hit movies.T'Challa made his initial appearance in Captain America 3: Civil War. In Black Panther he returns to his mystical homeland of Wakanda to become king after the death of his father. Wakanda so far has kept his its powers, wealth, resources and technology hidden.However T'Challa's late father hid a dark secret about his own brother, who wanted to use force to aid his fellow black brothers in the USA. Now the dead brother's son, Killmonger wants to battle T'Challa for the throne and he wants Wakanda to lead the struggle for black power and cause chaos around the world.The film pulls a nice trick in having two foes, at first we are led to believe it is going to be Klaue.However I found the film rather choppy and in some ways predictable. At times I kept thinking back to the Lion King.I liked that Marvel is not afraid to enter the debate about discrimination and whether it is right and legitimate to use force to overcome it. It is something Marvel Comics has tackled from its early days.A well mounted, good looking action film but it lacks substance. The box office figures are shocking. It is good but not that good."", '""Black Panther"" is a great deception for any viewer with brains. The hype creates expectation but the film is absolutely overrated. The plot and the characters are shallow and senseless. The Wakanda society accepts the dispute for the kingdom between the outsider Erik Killmonger and T\'Challa without any plebiscite. The villain defeats T\'Challa is a fair fight as per the Rules. Then Tchalla´s mother, sister and girlfriend recover him using the powerful plant destined to Wakanda kings. And T\'Challa returns to Wakanda in a coup d\'état, destroying the aircrafts sent by Killmonger to the spies. W\'Kabi and his army support Killmonger and in the end, it seems that everything is all right in Wakanda that seems to have a great division between the social classes. There is also excessive references to the ""birth of mankind"" in the view of the writer. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Pantera Negra"" (""Black Panther"")', ""This film was very well received and praised by critics on arrival. The cynic in me still believes that the social importance of the film means that many people were willing it to success even before seeing it. To be fair, the film is a good standalone entry in the Marvel universe of films, but at the same time it is still a film in the franchise - not some magically new type of beast. The high percentage of the cast who are black and positive characters is probably the most obvious thing highlighted by the critics, although it does seem like window dressing at times, with the African culture laid on thick on everything. Interestingly, the film reinforces negative images of African-Americans through the view characters from this specific group - not overly so, but enough to notice as it clashes with the main presentation.Outside of its value as social tool, to show studios yet again that they should not assume what they assume about their mass audience, the film itself is fun, lively and mostly interesting. The plot has good pace and nice developments, although it is not as morally murky as it could have been. Some of the cast do play to this aspect, but the film never really wants to be in a grey area so much as to have clear goodies and baddies. The action sequences are good and play out with the usual humor and high production standards. The cast is well led by Boseman, who has charisma and presence. He is very well supported by a deep cast - with Jordan in particular making a great 'villain'. Ironic in a film praised in America for being a positive challenge to the sort of 'OscarSoWhite' world of Hollywood, that so many of the cast are British but regardless so many people are good here with few weak links.In the end it is still a Marvel franchise film, and first and foremost it does what this needs and does it well. The social aspects are important, but not while you're watching it - which is fine because it is enjoyable and slick enough to hold the attention and be worth a look."", ""In this film we get the background to the Marvel character Black Panther. It includes the expected cameo from Stan Lee (craps table) and the climax battle. In order to become king, Chadwick Boseman had to fight a Mr. T looking guy and then he is given gadgets that would make James Bond envious. Worshipers of Bast will certainly be delighted. Good action film. The media has hyped this film as some sort of African-American statement of.....I am not sure what. It wasn't as preachy as I was lead to believe and certainly doesn't tell us anything we don't know about society or history. The comedy was scarce and the film was not as entertaining as Iron Man (what was), but is worthy of the Marvel Series."", ""I feel so bad giving this film a poor rating, because I feel it's important for many reasons, socially, culturally, so important to finally see a principally black cast lead the way in the year's biggest movie event.Dazzling special effects, great acting, but aside from that I couldn't say much in favour of the film, if I'm being totally honest it bored me throughout, I yawned the whole way through, as everything in this movie has been literally done to death, no new ideas, no originality, it felt like a B version of Wonder Woman.I saw it based on the many wonderful and positive reviews, maybe I was having an off day, it just bored me to tears."", 'Actually that is not entirely true, because you can go back. Then again that would not rhyme with Panther anyway. And not you as in you but Chadwick who ... well you\'ll know what I mean once you\'ve seen the movie. But back to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I am really still surprised that people who loathe what Marvel has done, go and watch the movies and just see what they already made up their mind they will get served in the first place.I\'d say this has an original take to it. I do understand if you say they feel the same to you. If that is the case, don\'t bother watching them. Also I\'m still surprised there are people out there who still haven\'t figured out there are stingers at the end of the movie. During and after the credits - stay tuned folks. Now another small incident that I witnessed that occured was when a couple came out of the movie an hour into it and upon me asking them if they were alright, they said they didn\'t like the movie. Fair enough, we all like different things. Someone else asked them why though ... and their answer was that it was racist and cliche. Two white people claiming to know what black people think? Yep that surely must be the wrong side of ""woke"".Enjoy a movie that is more than just a movie. It was made and became a phenomenon. Now besides the ""Tolkien white guys"" (a joke that was made on set apparently, according to one of the two white guys in the movie, Martin Freeman), this gives us a movie made under the helm of Marvel but creatively they put a lot of trust into their director. And this was something that touched a nerve in the public - rightfully so. Because apart from having a predominantly black cast (and director), this also is a very entertaining and good movie.The movie itself gives us a closer look behind the mythology of the Panther. And it is quite interesting. There are a few hiccups along the ride, but the movie works overall. And it adds to the ""universe"". Those movies are supposed to be light and fun ... but they still can carry a small political message. Both are not mutually exclusive', ""When I read the reviews of these super-hero movies I begin to wonder what the haters expect. Even with the film's generally high rating, a lot of the individual reviews bash this film for whatever reason, whether it's the story line, the CGI, the acting, take your pick. For me, it was a super-hero action flick that served well in that capacity, even if some of the elements are derivative of other sources. Certainly the costuming and cinematography is expertly done, and the character motivations are developed well enough to distinguish the good guys from the bad guys. If there's a bone to pick it's with the screenwriters, I would have preferred less of the modern day tendency toward globalization that the picture fosters. Though the villain Erik Stevens/Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) made a compelling case for T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) and the rest of Wakanda to share their wealth, knowledge and resources with the rest of the world, I didn't see it as their obligation to do so. But the irony is, after all the fighting, death and destruction, T'Challa eventually wound up coming around to that side of the argument, which made Killmonger a martyr for no cause. Once again, it was good to see Black Panther creator and Marvel Comic guru Stan Lee in a spot cameo as a casino patron in South Korea. The credits list him as a 'thirsty gambler', which makes it sound like he was some kind of lush but it didn't appear that way in the picture. I think my favorite character in the story was Letitia Wright's Shuri. She was smart, feisty, and dedicated to her brother and her country, and it didn't hurt that she looked like someone I know. A remarkable resemblance actually, and if I didn't know better, I'd think that Black Panther might live right down the street from me."", 'I had never heard of the Marvel character Black Panther before the movie got released, so that made it even more of a surprise. What an experience. I don\'t think that I would go so far as to call the movie a masterpiece, but it\'s to see a superhero movie unlike the ones that we\'re used to seeing. Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong\'o, Danai Gurira, Martin Freeman, Daniel Kaluuya, Letitia Wright, Winston Duke, Angela Bassett, Forest Whitaker and Andy Serkis put on some impressive performances, and I especially enjoyed hearing all the different languages spoken. With any luck, ""Black Panther"" will lead to a more complex focus on Africa in cinema in the coming years.', 'The leading hero of this next instalment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe made his first appearance in Captain America: Civil War, his solo movie is seen as an important superhero movie, opening the door to black leading heroes, directed by Ryan Coogler (Creed). Basically centuries ago, five African tribes war over a meteorite containing vibranium, one warrior ingests a ""heart-shaped herb"" affected by the metal and gains superhuman abilities, becoming the first ""Black Panther"". He unites all but the Jabari Tribe to form the nation of Wakanda, the Wakandans use the vibranium to develop advanced technology and pose as a Third World country to isolate themselves from the world. In 1992, King T\'Chaka (John Kani) visits his undercover brother N\'Jobu (Sterling K. Brown) in Oakland, California. T\'Chaka accuses N\'Jobu of assisting black-market arms dealer Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) with stealing vibranium from Wakanda. N\'Jobu\'s partner reveals he is Zuri (Denzel Whitaker), another undercover Wakandan, and confirms T\'Chaka\'s suspicions. In the present day, following the death of T\'Chaka, his son T\'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) returns to Wakanda to assume the throne, and to become the next Black Panther. Nakia (Lupita Nyong\'o), T\'Challa\'s ex-lover from an undercover assignment, Okoye (Danai Gurira), the leader of the Dora Milaje regiment, his mother Ramonda (Angela Bassett) and younger sister Shuri (Letitia Wright) all attend the coronation. At the ceremony, the Jabari Tribe\'s leader M\'Baku (Winston Duke) challenges T\'Challa for the crown in ritual combat, T\'Challa defeats M\'Baku and convinces him to yield rather than die. After Klaue and Erik ""Killmonger"" Stevens (Michael B. Jordan) steal a Wakandan artifact from a museum, T\'Challa\'s friend and Okoye\'s lover W\'Kabi (Daniel Kaluuya) urges him to bring Klaue back dead or alive. T\'Challa, Okoye, and Nakia travel to Busan, South Korea where Klaue plans to sell the artifact to CIA agent Everett K. Ross (Martin Freeman), a firefight breaks out and Klaue tries to escape, T\'Challa catches him, he reluctantly allows Ross to take him into custody. Klaue tells Ross that Wakanda\'s international image is a front for a technologically advanced civilization, Erik attacks and extracts Klaue, Ross is severely protecting Nakia, T\'Challa decides to save Ross rather than pursuing Klaue, taking him to Wakanda. While Shuri heals Ross, T\'Challa confronts Zuri (Forest Whitaker) about N\'Jobu, Zuri explains that N\'Jobu planned to share Wakanda\'s technology with people of African descent around the world and take it over. As T\'Chaka arrested N\'Jobu, N\'Jobu attacked Zuri, forcing T\'Chaka to kill him, they covered up the fact that they had left behind N\'Jobu\'s American son, Erik, who became a U. S. black ops soldier. Meanwhile Killmonger, aka N\'Jadaka, kills Klaue and takes his body to Wakanda, he stands before the tribe elders, revealing his identity and claiming to be the true heir to the throne. Killmonger challenges T\'Challa to ritual combat; after killing Zuri, he defeats T\'Challa and hurls him over a waterfall. Killmonger ingests the heart-shaped herb, Killmonger orders the rest are incinerated, but Nakia extracts one first, supported by W\'Kabi and his army, Killmonger prepares to distribute shipments of Wakandan weapons around the world. Nakia, Shuri, Ramonda and Ross go to the Jabari Tribe for help, there they find T\'Challa who was rescued and is in a coma, he is healed by Nakia\'s herb. T\'Challa returns to fight Killmonger, who dons his own Black Panther suit and commands W\'Kabi and his army to attack T\'Challa. Shuri, Nakia, and the Dora Milaje join T\'Challa, while Ross remotely pilots a jet and takes down the planes carrying the vibranium weapons, M\'Baku and the Jabari arrive to reinforce T\'Challa. Confronted by Okoye, W\'Kabi and his army stand down, T\'Challa fights Killmonger in Wakanda\'s vibranium mine, Killmonger\'s suit is disrupted and T\'Challa stabs him, Killmonger refuses to be healed, choosing to die a free man rather than be incarcerated. T\'Challa establishes an outreach center at the building where N\'Jobu died to be run by Nakia and Shuri, and T\'Challa appears before the United Nations to reveal Wakanda\'s true nature to the world. In a post-credits sequence, Shuri is with Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) who is in recuperation. Also starring Florence Kasumba as Ayo and Stan Lee as Thirsty Gambler. Boseman is a good choice as the hero, Jordan is a fairly good villain, and there is great support from Wright, Gurira, Serkis, Freeman and others, most putting on convincing South African or American accents, the story is maybe a little complicated at times, but there enough exciting chase and explosive sequences, filled with fantastic special effects, to keep you engaged, and it is also a good exploration of African culture, a worthwhile superhero action adventure. It won the Oscars for Best Original Score for Ludwig Göransson, Best Costume Design, and Best Production Design, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Original Song for ""All the Stars"" (also won the Golden Globe), Best Sound Editing, and Best Sound Mixing, it won the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama, and Best Original Score. Very good!', 'With all the hype surrounding this movie, I must admit that I had expected something extraordinary.However the ""Black Panther"" movie was not all as outstanding as it was cranked up to be. Don\'t get me wrong here, because I am not saying the movie is bad. Far from it as it was still rather enjoyable. It just wasn\'t outstanding amidst the many Marvel movies that flood the movie market.The storyline in ""Black Panther"" was adequate, albeit somewhat generic and predictable.The acting in the movie was good and they really had gotten together a great ensemble of actors and actresses to perform in the movie. Personally, then I was most impressed with Andy Serkis, and it was quite nice to see him in person and not doing blue-suit performances.The action was fast paced and well-choreographed, which definitely added to the overall enjoyment of the movie.This being a Marvel superhero movie, of course you expect a grand visual presentation of CGI. And let me just say that the CGI in the movie were great, as they always are in these Marvel superhero movies.All in all, an entertaining enough movie. Although not among the top of superhero movies for me.', ""I watched this at home on DVD from my public library, my wife chose to skip it.I had very high hopes for this movie, considering all the hype, and while I enjoyed it I thought it should have been much better. I like the concept, millions of years ago, before humans inhabited this particular part of Central Africa, a meteorite crashed into and energized the land. When humans arrived they created this insular nation, trading with no other, while developing technology far advanced ahead of the rest of the world. A concept for a story that I don't recall hearing before, but somewhat akin to the Wonder Woman story.The actors are all first-rate, but ultimately the story degrades into a war between factions, great battles involving indestructible warriors. Which I suppose is inevitable, how else can they write the story? But still it was a disappointment, it just seemed to me the writers could have come up with a better storyline."", 'What does empowerment mean for black people? While this is not exactly the central question for T\'Challa, there is a part of this question for him. He has to not only be a king but know how to do it. Does he stay an isolationist, clinging to the world he was raised in and all of the vibranium included, or share the knowledge and tech with the world? Information and resources, wealth, science, that leads to people becoming empowered because they have what they didnt.This is in direct contrast with another kind of empowerment, through dominance and wiping out oppressors, and that is what Killmonger represents. But does he come from some place that is inhuman? Not really; Eric is from a world of pain, of heartache and loss, and by how he decided what made the most sense - getting jacked and becoming a super-soldier (no, not that one, sans what Captain America\'s got) - it charted how he saw becoming a ruler. Can one become empowered through revolution? It\'s arguable, and that\'s the key thing. ""Kill white""? He wouldn\'t be the first, or the last.But Killmonger (what a name) is the villain when all is said and done because he doesn\'t see change being possible in others, whether white or black or whomever. All he sees is the chaos and anger of the world, and sees it as a personal struggle. I didn\'t see it right off on the first viewing until Double Toasted in their review pointed to it, but there is a stark Trump parallel one could make with Jordan\'s character.... Though with a bit more of the Malcolm X and less of the, you know, white supremacist side. But then again, supremacy is supremacy and so is demagoguery.These sound like some heavy concepts for a Marvel movie and they are, but the brilliance or Coogler\'s movie is that he smuggles (or it may just be out in the open and direct) in an action-filled spy epic with Shakespearean overtones (and all the soap-opera that comes with Mr Shakespeare and his royalty epics). This doesn\'t mean it\'s without some flaws, both technical (there\'s some poor CGI in the third act, and in other parts too, though not all bad), and in the plot (mostly in some familiarity with Winston Duke\'s character, though he fills him with personality to burn). I\'m not even sure it hit me emotionally as Civil War or Iron Man as far as Marvel movies go.But as far as movies I\'ve rated a 4.5 out of 5, this is one of the better ones. It has a lot on it\'s mind, and it has a great way of bringing these ideas to the largest possible audience - not to mention, with both race and gender representation - it\'s the most woke movie ever made.', ""This review replaces my original one from a few days ago when I said I wasn't as impressed with this one as the other Marvel movies. I also said I didn't think Chadwick Boseman was as impressive playing T'Challa as he was previously when playing Jackie Robinson or James Brown. Since I didn't sleep this time when watching this a second time, I can now say that Boseman was indeed as good, maybe even better, here as when playing those real-life public figures. And since I also now understand why the events happened when they did, I think this is as good, maybe even better, as those other Marvel movies made by that studio for the last several years. So that's a high recommendation of Black Panther."", ""This film tells the story of a super human who helps the prince of an African nation to succeed in the throne, and helps to prevent a war from breaking out.It's refreshing to have an African superhero, and even more refreshing to have a film that incorporates a lot of African cultural and ethnic elements. I looked the scene where people in various running costumes gather sound a waterfall. That was spectacular. The story itself is very engaging, and it's great to see both traditional and superhero style fights in ample quantities. The cities are very stylish as well. It is a great blend of enough elements and futuristic elements. There are also plenty of rises and falls in the plot to engage the viewers. The visuals are great as well. I really enjoyed it."", 'Everything you could ask for in a superhero movie. Great action, great acting, and some good ole arse kicking. A superhero for the modern age, black panther gives us all the vibes. The ladies keep it real, redefining what it means to be a supporting role, and taking up arms in killer action scenes. I also quite enjoy a bad guy who is relatable and toes that line. Michael B. Jordan really shines as kilmonger, he makes the movie.', ""I could say Marvel does it again or I could say Marvel outdid themselves and both would be true because Marvel regularly produces hits. They are the Elvis, the Michael Jackson or The Beatles of cinema. Even when a movie receives much hype, such as this one, they still live up to the hype.I had Black Panther circled on my calendar for months (even before I knew the release date). I'm not a Black Panther aficionado, but likewise I was no Iron Man, Blade, Avengers et al aficionado yet I loved those movies.Black Panther was excellently done all around: the story, the acting, the action and the atmosphere it looked like time and effort was put into it. Everything looked authentic. I appreciated the atmosphere more than anything. Set in the fictitious land of Wakanda, hidden in the heart of Africa, it had such an authentic feel. They were able to portray this beautiful African nation in a way that showed it's difference from what we're but showing it in a dignified respectful manner. The scenery, the people, the atmosphere didn't look cheap, gimmicky or like a caricature. They came off like real people from a real culture.And the story was layered and complex. It wasn't simply revenge or lunacy and it definitely wasn't black and white. There were some real ideological issues and battles in there with no right answer. Of course the action sequences were on point but that's to be expected. I'm just thrilled that it lived up to the hype."", 'A groundbreaking magnum opus of cinematic marketing for African-Americans, ""Creed"" director Ryan Coogler\'s ""Black Panther"" (** OUT OF ****) has demonstrated the impact that a film can create when a single demographic embraces it. The 18th Marvel Studios superhero saga has coined over a billion dollars. Apart from the R-rated Marvel Comics ""Blade"" trilogy, African-Americans have waited patiently for a suitable larger-than-life champion with a PG-13 rating. A largely derivative but a polished escapade from start to finish, ""Black Panther"" amounts to a standard-issue, Panther malice-in-the-palace melodrama. The generational gap in the skewered relationship between father and son in director Ryan Coogler and Joe Robert Cole\'s screenplay provides this epic with its most thematically compelling material. The son spends most of his time handling the mistakes that his short-sighted father has made. The secret fantasy kingdom of Wakanda shares some similarities with the clandestine island in ""Wonder Woman."" Basically, ""Black"" constitutes an origins story about a hero in a cat-suit with ears and his homeland. Mind you, this isn\'t the first time Black Panther has graced the silver screen. He made his debut in the contrived and drawn-out ""Captain America: Civil War"" (2016) where the Avengers broke ranks and swore loyalty to either Captain America or Iron Man. Chadwick Boseman exhibits the steadfast confidence and physical agility to play Marvel Comic\'s first African-born superhero. Unfortunately, since he is not only a king, but also a politician who symbolizes the status quo, he seems hopelessly bland and straightforward. Boseman needs to jettison the pseudo-African accent that he uses as Prince T\'Challa because it sounds synthetic. Comparably, Michael B. Jordan emerges as far more appealing than a ruthless adversary should. As an illegitimate ghetto offspring of Wakandan blood, the charismatic Jordan spouts the minimal number of profanities allowed for a PG-13 rating. Similarly, the dynamic women who surround Black Panther as his elite bodyguard are far more exciting than the ruler they shield from danger. For the record, Stan Lee and Jack Kirby created ""Black Panther"" in 1966 when the character debuted in issue # 52 of first volume of the ""The Fantastic Four."" The film ""Black Panther"" opens as a narrator explains that long before mankind arose, an enormous meteorite crashed into the jungles of Africa. The five tribes of Wakanda would eventually gravitate around the crash site. Described as ""the strongest metal in the universe,"" the vibranium in this meteorite drastically altered the composition of local plant life. The Five Tribes of Wakanda fought without closure until the Panther goddess Bast appeared in a vision to a shaman warrior. Four of the tribes lived together, while the fifth took up residence in the mountains. This warrior found a \'Heart-Shaped Herb\' that endowed him with superhuman strength as well as speed. He emerged as the first Black Panther. Meantime, the Wakandans excavated vibranium and forged technology as well as weapons far beyond anything else on Earth. Paranoid that the world would plunder their secrets, Wakanda guarded it jealously and withheld it to keep foreigners from exploiting it. Earlier in ""Captain America: Civil War,"" the Wakanda King T\'Challa died in an explosion at the United Nations in Vienna, and his son set out to find the killer. If you\'ve seen ""Civil War,"" you know the killer was none other than James ""Bucky"" Barnes, aka \'The Winter Soldier.\' Barnes reprises his role in an end credits cameo for anybody with the patience to stick around and watch it.Sadly, despite their best efforts to conceal the vibranium, the Wakandans fail. A colorful but cruel arms merchant, racist Afrikaner Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis of ""Avengers: The Age of Ultron""), and a renegade mercenary Erik \'Killmonger\' Stevens (Michael B. Jordan of ""Fantastic Four"") shoot up a British museum and steal an ancient Wakandan ax containing vibranium. Our hero T\'Challa / Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman of ""Get on Up"") pursues Klaue, but \'Killmonger\' beats our hero to the villainous Afrikaner. Meantime, T\'Challa satisfies all the rituals before his coronation. He must submit to any challengers who want to fight him for his monarchy. Of course, nobody confronts him since they respect him. As their new King, T\'Challa learns about the dreadfully unfair demise of his father\'s brother N\'Jobu (Sterling K. Brown of ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"") and his ghetto-born son. \'Killmonger\' challenges T\'Challa, and they slug it out in a pool located atop a perilous waterfall. T\'Challa appears to finally have met his match, but \'Killmonger\' lets him escape. Plunging into a deep gorge where a torrential river flows, T\'Challa vanishes from sight. The authorities proclaim \'Killmonger\' the new Wakandan king. His first imperial act is to share vibranium with other Third World black countries. Of course, you know \'Killmonger\' cannot get away with this perfidy. Predictably, T\'Challa may be down, but it isn\'t entirely out of the picture.Our hero need not worry about hasty last-minute costume changes. He wears a necklace that deploys his black, one-piece outfit and activates all its myriad capabilities. For example, if you strike him, the suit channels the energy in reverse, and the assailant suffers blowback. The Wakandans boast an incredible arsenal of futuristic weapons. James Bond would envy some of these Wakandan gadgets. At one point, they save an American CIA agent, Everett K. Rose (Martin Freeman of ""Hot Fuzz""), from a devastating spinal wound that would have confined him for life in a wheelchair. English actor Freeman seems woefully miscast as an American. Coogler stages some modest action scenes. Nevertheless, everything about this formulaic adventure remains so by-the-numbers that you can guess the outcome. One of the more interesting characters, Andy Serkis\' Klaue, is probably the liveliest, but he gets his comeuppance about half-way through the heroics. You won\'t be able to take your eyes off Lupita Nyong\'o, Letitia Wright, and Danai Gurira. Altogether, ""Black Panther"" ushers long-overdue diversity into the Marvel Comics Universe, but this promising superhero pales by comparison with Wesley Snipes ""Blade"" for sheer bravado and derring-do.', 'A voice from a young boy asks to tell him a story. The adults voice tells the story of ""Vibranium."" A gigantic meteorite with the toughest metal: vibranium, crashed in the region of the sources of the Nile river, ""millions"" of years ago and it affected the plants. Later, in the age of humans, five tribes in the land named Wakanda battled for control of that vibranium until a spirit led a certain warrior to find and eat a ""heart-shaped herb"" affected by the metal. He gained superhuman abilities, and became the first ""Black Panther"". Four of the five tribes submit to his power but one tribe wants freedom. The Wakandans use the vibranium to develop highly-advanced technology. They see the horrors of the other nations and isolated themselves from the rest of the world. They hid and pretended that they are not industrially developed like a third world country.In Oakland, California, Prince N\'Jobu (Sterling K. Brown) vows to share Wakandas technology with people of African descent around the world in order to help them conquer their oppressors. N\'Jobu enlists black-market arms dealer Ulysses Klaue to infiltrate Wakanda and remove a cache of vibranium.In 1992, King T\'Chaka learns of his brother\'s actions. He confronts N\'Jobu, who becomes angry and threatens to kill T\'Chaka\'s loyal friend, Zuri (Forest Whitaker). T\'Chaka reluctantly kills N\'Jobu to save Zuri, and abandons N\'Jobu\'s son Erik in order to prevent the Wakandan people from learning the truth.In the present day, following T\'Chaka\'s death at the hands of Helmut Zemo, disguised as a masked James Barnes, his son T\'Challa returns to Wakanda to assume the throne. After working with Okoye, the leader of the all-female fighting force the Dora Milaje, to extract his ex-lover Nakia from an undercover assignment in Nigeria\'s Sambisa Forest, he reunites with his mother Queen Ramonda and younger sister Princess Shuri, the nation\'s current technological genius. At his kingship ceremony he is challenged for the crown by M\'Baku, the leader of the fifth tribe, the mountain-dwelling Jabari. The two engage in ritual combat, with T\'Challa emerging victorious and becoming the new King. He let\'s M\'Baku live.In London, a gang led by Klaue and including an ex-U.S. black ops soldier, Erik Stevens a/k/a/ ""Killmonger,"" steals an ancient Wakandan vibranium ax from a museum. When the tribal elders receive word that Klaue has resurfaced in South Korea, T\'Challa\'s friend W\'Kabi, who lost his parents as a result of the dealer\'s actions, urges the young monarch to bring him to justice. T\'Challa, Okoye, and Nakia plan to intercept Klaue at an underground casino in Busan, where he will be selling the ax to an unknown buyer. The plan, however, goes wrong when T\'Challa discovers the buyer is CIA agent Everett Ross and Klaue suspects the deal is a setup.The deal subsequently goes sour, and a car chase ensues that culminates in Klaue\'s apprehension. While in CIA custody, however, Klaue is rescued by Killminger. Ross is seriously injured saving Nakia in the attack, and rather than pursue Klaue, T\'Challa takes Ross to Wakanda where his sister Shuri uses the nation\'s advanced technology to save Ross\' life.Killmonger kills Klaue and takes his body to Wakanda as a token, revealing his identity as N\'Jobu\'s son to the tribal elders and challenging T\'Challa for the throne. Killmonger triumphs in ritual combat and hurls the defeated T\'Challa over a waterfall. After ingesting the heart-shaped herb to gain the powers of the Black Panther, Killmonger enacts his father\'s plan, preparing shipments of Wakandan weapons to be distributed to Wakandan operatives around the world. Nakia, Shuri, Ross, and T\'Challa\'s mother Ramonda flee to seek the aid of the Jabari and learn M\'Baku\'s men have found and are caring for the comatose T\'Challa.Healed by a heart-shaped herb brought by Nakia, T\'Challa returns to Wakanda and to renew his combat with Killmonger for the throne, which was never officially concluded since T\'Challa never died or conceded. When Killmonger refuses to cooperate, his claim to the throne is immediately invalidated and Okoye and the Dora Milaje turn against him. However, Killmonger who is now wearing a suit of Black Panther armor of his own resists with force along with the Border Tribe. While Shuri, Nakia, and Jabari battle W\'Kabi, Ross, piloting a remote jet with Shuri\'s guidance, shoots down the planes carrying the weapons before they can leave the country. The battle goes poorly for T\'Challa\'s side until M\'Baku and the Jabari arrive to support him, thus turning the tide. T\'Challa and Killmonger\'s battle carries them into the heart of the vibranium mine, where sonic disrupted used in the transport of the metal incapacitate their vibranium armor. While Killmonger\'s body is briefly exposed, T\'Challa stabs his cousin. He takes Killmonger to see the sunset of Wakanda and offers to heal him. But Killmonger states that he knows he will then be imprisoned and would rather die a free man. He pulls the dagger out of his chest and dies peacefully.With that victory, T\'Challa is officially restored to the throne, with M\'Baku granted a seat in the national tribal council to represent his tribe in recognition of his loyalty. Rejecting the isolationism of past Wakandan kings, T\'Challa establishes an embassy in the United States to be run by Nakia and Shuri. In a mid-credits scene, T\'Challa appears before the United Nations to reveal Wakanda\'s true nature to the world. In a post-credits scene, Shuri continues to help Bucky Barnes with his recuperation.']"
45,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Avengers: Infinity War,4154756,"[""Have found myself liking or loving a lot of Marvel's previous work, while finding a few faults with most. It is very easy on the most part to see why they are highly regarded critically, though those more critical of their work have raised criticisms that can be agreed with by me. Loved the first 'Avengers' film, while 'Age of Ultron' was more problematic and generally a lesser Marvel effort though still having a good deal to admire. 'Infinity War' for me was the best one, or the one enjoyed most. Would also go far to say it's one of Marvel's overall best, and a perfect example of how to do a superhero film and how to balance a large cast of characters and a lot going on. Can totally see why it has been so positively reviewed and it deserves the positive hype from personal opinion, though would hesitate in calling it flawless or one of the best films ever. More could have been done with the very end, which felt like it ended a little too suddenly without resolving everything to full effect. It may very well have been leaving room for a follow-up, but to me it's always been dangerous somewhat to do that just in case a follow-up doesn't happen.Scarlett Johansson also has far too little to do, with too short screen-time. Black Widow is the only character to me who felt underdeveloped and Johansson struggles to do much with it.However, the rest of the cast are spot on. A big shout out goes to Josh Brolin, who makes for a menacing and melancholic Thanos. Speaking of Thanos, Marvel have tended to underwhelm with their villains, underwriting them and giving them vague or inconsistent motivations. Thanos is easily one of the best Marvel villains along with Hela, one of the most interesting and of surprising complexity where he is a threat but one can see his point of view.Robert Downey Jnr, Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth are also standouts of a near-uniformly great all-star cast. There are a lot of characters here, but somehow on the most part it didn't feel like there were too many (a big danger with films with many characters and a trap fallen into quite a lot). They hold a lot of intrigue and manage not to be too sided and true to character. Likewise, the story is very eventful with a busy main story and several subplots. Yet it didn't feel sprawling and managed to make sense and never lose engagement. Basically it's a non-stop thrill-ride and tautly paced, with some reveals that leaves one gasping, twists that genuinely shock, rousing entrances and some of the finest action sequences of any Marvel film or any film recently, that are truly exciting and big in scale without being too noisy or exhausting. The climax is truly epic, in scale, spectacle, thrills and emotion. 'Avengers: Infinity War' hugely impresses in the script too, with snappy banter, hilarious quips (along with 'Thor: Ragnarok' this is one of the funniest Marvel films, Thor has the best of it), tension and an emotional poignancy not seen to this extent or as strongly in Marvel films. It's all intelligently handled and the humour didn't feel misplaced or inappropriate to me, this is a Marvel film that delivers on the spectacle and thrills while also having brains and heart. Marvel never disappoints when it comes to the production values. 'Avengers: Infinity War' is not an exception. It's beautifully and atmospherically designed, slickly filmed and edited and the special effects, not overused or abused, are some of the most extravagant and spectacular for any film seen recently. It's tightly directed and dynamically and rousingly scored. Overall, an excellent film and one of my standout viewings of all the films seen so far from the first half, and overall, of 2018. 9/10 Bethany Cox"", ""So, here we have it: AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR, the Marvel climax to a string of approximately twenty prior movies and considered by many to be the crowning achievement of the genre thus far. And I do admit it makes for a rollocking good time, a two-and-a-half-hour rollercoaster ride of thrills, spills and excellent special effects to tell a story of good and evil, chaos and destruction, with a massive and awesome span across the galaxy. Just seeing all of the returning characters is a delight in itself, and they're all given their own moments to shine. The humour is fast and witty as you'd expect from an Avengers film, and the startling CGI work is endlessly enjoyable. The story ably mixes together character interaction with big battles and showdowns and there's never a slow moment from beginning to end. I can't wait to see the follow-up!"", 'The Avengers face their most powerful opponent yet in Thanos. Thanos is collecting the six Infinity Gems for his Infinity Gauntlet to execute his evil plan. The heroes of the MCU struggle to stop him.It is amazing that this works as well as it does. This could be best described as The Empire Strikes Back portion of the MCU so far. The heroes get their butts kicked from one end of the universe to the other. It ends with a mass disintegration which is honestly even sadder and much darker than TESB. TESB ends bittersweet but this is just dark. Although anybody with a brain would see that the snap will be reversed in some way. There are many deaths that cannot happen which does diminishes the shock value of the ending. They can\'t kill off Spider-Man because the MCU doesn\'t even own him. Sony would never let it happen. They also can\'t kill off Black Panther due to his future movie and more importantly, his new popularity. Obviously, some characters will not make it but I think the vast majority will rise from the dead. The constant death reversals in the MCU saps away the shock value and that\'s probably this movie\'s main drawback. If they picked different characters to disintegrate, I might have doubts about reversing it.The advantage of the MCU is that these characters are so familiar that none of them needs introduction. In fact, this one starts from the end of Thor: Ragnarok and is no worst off by it. The relationships are well established. It\'s great fun to have them run into other heroes they\'ve never met. Thor joining the Guardians generates a whole lot of hilarity. Drax is especially funny. Quill\'s insecurities is fun. There is an interesting pairing of Stark and Dr. Strange with Spider-Man as a fun sidekick. Relationships continue to be the strength of this franchise. The heroes are so well defined that the movie can spend its time with the villain. One of this franchise\'s weakness has always been the lackluster villains but Thanos is allowed to have his character development. His view points and his love for his daughter Gamora give him real depth. In many ways, this is Thanos\' movie and it is more compelling due to the development.I do have some other minor issues. The giant Dinklage may be oddly cute at first but it\'s just odd. That section doesn\'t have the same action as Wakanda. Thor holding open the iris is not much of an action scene. I\'d rather have that section finish quicker without flipping back and forth there. I would push that section back into the middle. The plan for Vision\'s stone seems like a low percentage play and his reasoning for sacrificing himself seems much more poetic. There has to be a way to do a ""needs of the many"" scene earlier and end in the same place anyways. Overall, this is well-constructed, well-conceived, and well-made. Despite the darkness, it still has its fun. The plot never stalls. The villains are great. The heroes are never in doubt. The franchise continues to be in good hands.', 'Thanos is busy collecting Infinity Stones for his Gauntlet, starting out by killing Loki, and spends the bulk of the movie roving around the universe collecting most of them, while his minions try to get the two on this planet, thwarted by the various super-powered individuals (and the Black Widow), while the Guardians of the Galaxy hook up with Thor to thwart him from one and build the anti-Thanos weapon, preparatory to the final battle which (spoiler) takes place in Wakanda.The three hour movie rambled hither and yon, with most characters getting enough screen time to be identifiable. Nonetheless, at the forty-five-minute mark, I whispered to my cousin ""I\'ve lost track of who\'s who"" and he muttered back ""Me too"", despite having seen all the earlier movies. Chris Hemsworth as Thor gets the best jokes, there\'s one major continuity issue that annoyed me in the big final battle, and the visuals abandoned their adherence to comics I could identify -- understandably so, given the great range of sources they used. Still, it was a well-run matter, even if the MCU has gotten too large for a single movie to include everyone.For those who look forward to the little scene that runs after the credit starts, you\'ll have time to duck out for a quick bathroom break (almost three hours, as I said), as it takes place at the end of the credits and leads into CAPTAIN MARVEL, schedule for 2019 -- which is supposed to be set in the 1990s.', '""Avengers: Infinity War"" is the newest addition to the now already long-running Marvel superhero franchise and in my opinion this movie is a definite contender for best installment of all. These 2.5 hours were directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, who started with Community and then entered the Marvel world with Captain America and for this new Avengers movie, they reunited with writers Markus and McFeely. Let me start by saying that I was a bit critical about previous Marvel films, especially Avengers movies as they frequently united way too many characters without properly elaborating on most of them. And the stories about them failing on their own against the villains, but eventually managing to succeed as a team after overcoming their conflicts and differences was gently-speaking not too new or creative. But this one here is different. Almost all characters have their moment to shine really, well Black Widow could have had a little more than that Hulk moment, but she is the exception. Even those they added new now like the Guardians of the Galaxy and the characters from Black Panther add their fair share of material worth seeing. Peter Dinklage is pretty interesting and memorable as a dwarf (yep!), the stories on romance and male friendship are nice to watch too and even Benedict Cumberbatch is tolerable for once.I think that movies, especially superhero films, often stand and fall with their villain and here we have Thanos played by Josh Brolin as the main antagonist and he is just utterly great and memorable. Maybe you could say that his (self-perceived godly) ambition to erase half the planet is a bit too mathematical, but everything else about him is outstanding and I have virtually no doubt that he will end up as one of the most memorable villains of the movie year 2018. Even in his weaker story lines, like the part with his ""daughter"" that does not feel entirely convincing early on, he shines and elevates the material to a level where it really saves this entire part of the movie. So yes huge thumbs-up for Thanos. And another thumbs-up for virtually everybody else. Except Starlord unfortunately because honestly his grief may have been huge, but the how he basically destroyed the Avengers\' effort that had them close to victory was just ridiculous, so to some extent you can blame him for billions of people dying eventually. Or are they really? I believe there will be a new Avengers movie in 2019 by the same team of writers and directors, so the ending may not be as finite as it seemed to be. You can almost call it a duology. Is all hope really lost? We have to wait a year and see. Honestly I doubt it because there will be a Black Panther 2 for sure at some point, so I guess they will find a way to get things right again for the good guys. It will also be interesting to see if they bring back those who died earlier too, not just those that vanished at the very end.Anyway, this film we have here is one that will make a huge impact come awards season 2018/2019 in all technical categories, especially Visual Effects where it is maybe a lock for an Oscar nomination with a great chance to take home the win. Another thing I would like to say about this film is that it is also a triumph in terms of the comedy, which is not always a success in Marvel works. But here there are some really hilarious scenes and as many bad things as I said about Chris Pratt\'s character earlier, his banter with Thor is hilarious. And there is a lot more of course. Drax is also amazing in that one scene where he stands there doing nothing. You will recognize many other pretty funny moments when you see them. So what is it that made this film so amazing. I would say it is the script this time. It is bold, daring and not scared of anything while never becoming too absurd or unrealistic (and yes that is possible for superhero films *cough* Deadpool *cough* glad we did not see him in here). But the outcome here is the exact opposite of too many cooks spoiling the broth, both character- and writer-wise. You absolutely do not want to miss out on this one and good thing is you really don\'t need to have seen any other Avengers or Marvel movie to appreciate the quality we were given with this one. I am truly very curious about the sequel and cannot wait to check it out. This third Avengers movie is my favorite 2018 release at the point of April. And it has a huge chance to stay in the top5, probably top3 until the end of the year. It never dragged, which is always a success for this running time and it gets better by the minute the longer it goes. And the way things turn out eventually reminded me a bit of the last Wolverine film ""Logan"". Happy endings are no longer essential. Realism is what it is all about. Highly highly recommended.', 'When I was a kid just after watching Superman II that one day there will be a film that will have in it, Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman as well as other DC Comics superheroes but it will knocked out of the park by a Marvel film starring the Hulk, Spiderman, Thor, Iron Man and others I would had not believed you. Heck Black Panther did twice more business in the US box office than the Justice League film.Usually villains in superhero films want power just to destroy everything. Thanos the villain wants to bring chaos and destroy what seems half the population of the worlds in order to bring a new order of peace and prosperity. No more starving kids scavenging for food. It is a Nazi way of thinking, we get people in social media platforms who go on about how we need to control the population growth to save the planet. So reduce the population in Africa, in Asia in the Middle East. You know find a way to get rid of those black and brown people! Well Stan Lee who created a lot of the Marvel characters is Jewish and knew about the perils of this Nazi way of thinking.Thanos wants his infinity stones to get ultimate power. You might think he has never loved something or anyone but he need to make sacrifices himself. His quest for the stones sees him battling Thor at the start of the film. Along the way their are casualties which leaves you wondering what will happen to those individual Marvel films in the future.The Russo Brothers have certainly made a film where the various characters from the Marvel universe coming together feel natural and organic. Just look as to how well the Guardians of the Galaxy characters gel with Thor or Tony Stark.They also have made the film so well paced although the running time is a tad overlong. It starts with action scenes and the action scenes crop up in this film relentlessly but we also get humour and brief character moments but always you know this is a comic book adaptation.', ""I bought the hype a bit for this one, which is unlike me, but it did seem like an 'event' that this would be part of the end game for a series of films that have dominated the landscape for about a decade. Of course, it doesn't get to that point by doing much you don't know it will do, and as such there is plenty of action, special effects, witty dialogue, and big moments. So, in some ways it is the same as what these films have always done, but then again it deserves praise for not being what it could easily have been - a bloated failure of excess.Instead it is surprisingly light on its feet for a film that has so many characters in so many constant action sequences, that carries a lot of supposed darkness but yet has to do it with humor and entertainment value throughout. I know it is a mass produced product, but there is still plenty to admire in the construction of it. As a narrative it has a lot to offer, but the demands on it are too great to allow it to bring out what it could have been. The darkness of it is the best thing about it. Thanos is conflicted in a satisfying way, and the film is never better than when we get to see this - although that is not often enough. The other darkness is the loss of major characters, which is impacting in the moment, but is undercut by the knowledge that all or most of them will be recovered - not least hinted by the many character-specific sequels lined up in years to come. I still enjoyed the darkness these brought, but enjoyed it with the knowledge that it was probably all for show.The film runs long and probably has too much consistent action for any of it to really raise pulses, but it does the job for a blockbuster - with the characters, darkness, and humor all covering it pretty well. It is far from the brilliant film that some will tell you, and too much of it does feel superficial (which of course it is), but it works much better than it really has any right to do."", ""This is an easy film to spoil, so I will keep it brief. Thanos (Josh Brolin) gathers a group of bad guys with the quest of obtaining all the infinity stones. His goal is to save the universe by killing off half of its life with the snap of a finger...and enjoy the sunset. The film combines all the Marvel characters available to do a film to fight the villains and Stan Lee to play a bus driver. The feature assumes you have seen all the other films as there is zero introduction of character, and hopes you have forgotten a few minor details that conflict with the current film. The film is generally darker than previous films, but still has the humor. I wished Star Lord had discovered a new tape whereby he could defeat Thanos. Not thrilled with the plot or ending. The production works with 3 subplots for much of the feature. The ending...well we know what happens next with a go back in time and let's hose this series up like they did X-Men."", 'Well the movie we\'ve been waiting for ... years! It\'s finally here and it doesn\'t dissapoint at all. You may nitpick and there are things to critisize as with all movies, but as a Universe Marvel did a fantastic job, setting characters up and giving us something to look for. So even the smallest things can make you chuckle (if you are like me and into that sort of stuff), like Groot and Captain America introducing themselves to each other. It\'s a character moment, but it\'s also as funny as it can be. And it is grounded into what we know about them and their attitude.So even when you have all that mayhem and all that fights going on, there is always time for other things. Quirky things, intelligent things and not just necessarily just social commentary (see Black Panther), but also dialog like the ""made up words"" argument (very fine moment indeed). And again, I\'m just giving you some simple moments, that really define how well thought out this all is. Not afraid to be self deprecating at times either.If you are able to avoid spoilers, please do and watch this to be surprised, to laugh, maybe even cry a little bit, but more important of all be entertained! I guess having to watch a few movies before this may seem like a chore for some, but once you start them and are not too negative about it, you will enjoy them ... just watched Ant Man and the Wasp and that was a hoot/blast too. But now I have to wait until next year ... for Captain Marvel and the ""conclusion"" of this ... I have some ideas where it might go ... By the way there is ""only"" one scene after the movie is over and it\'s after the credits ... sometimes you have to have room to breathe, so right decision!', 'Compared to the first two Avengers movies, I\'ve rated this one a solid \'9\' against a pair of \'7\'s\' for the other two. The prequels felt more like getting the most out of all the destruction that the super-heroes could inflict on their cosmic adversaries. That formula\'s still at work here but it seemed a lot fresher with the team-up between The Guardians and The Avengers, while Thanos (Josh Brolin) brought a decidedly different dimension to his role as an intergalactic enforcer. Some might even call his mission honorable, in as much as he wants to save the universe with his philosophy that ""If life is left unchecked, life will cease to exist"". Fresh on the heels of ""Thor:Ragnarok"", the Marvel and Disney folks do well here to keep the humor in place while dramatic events unfold throughout the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The Thor (Chris Hemsworth)/Star-Lord (Chris Pratt) dynamic was especially played well, and it was a hoot to see Thor accept Rabbit\'s, er..., Rocket\'s (voiced by Bradley Cooper) claim as captain of the Guardians. Where the film loses a point for me has to do with the inconsistency with some of the principal characters. Depending on which prior movie you care to cite, Thor and Doctor Strange have been positioned as the most powerful entities in the Marvel universe. However here, they were dispatched rather handily in the early going by Thanos\'s minions. There\'s also the quite literal overkill that occurs near the end of the story with the disintegration of heroes like Black Panther, Doc Strange and Spidey, along with the entire Guardian team. You know they have to make a come back in the follow up sequel(s), so it seemed like an almost cheap attempt to elicit pathos from the audience. By my count, at least fourteen Marvel characters met their demise in the story if you include Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and his partner in the after credits scene.Once again, and I can\'t help it, but kudos to Stan Lee, Marvel comic writer and originator of many of these characters, for his bus driver cameo near the beginning of the picture. His one line was particularly apropos: ""What\'s the matter with you kids? You never seen a spaceship before?""And oh yes, don\'t want to forget this little tidbit. There have been any number of movies with scenes set in New York City in which the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center are in prominent view prior to the events of 9/11, but in this flick, there\'s a quick glimpse offered of the new One World Trade Center rising from the city skyline. I thought that was very cool, and even better that it wasn\'t in the path of the New York City dust up.', ""SPOILER: The Marvel Cinematic Universe movie series has been fantastic, many fans including me were happy to see it celebrating its tenth anniversary, this next instalment in the Avengers series, bringing together over twenty Marvel superheroes, was the most ambitious and high anticipation, directed by the Russo brothers (Welcome to Collinwood, You, Me and Dupree, Captain America: The Winter Soldier & Civil War). Basically Thanos (Josh Brolin) and his lieutenants - Proxima Midnight (Carrie Coon), Ebony Maw (Tom Vaughan-Lawlor), Corvus Glaive (Michael James Shaw) and Cull Obsidian (Terry Notary) - have acquired the Power Stone. They intercept the ship carrying the survivors of Asgard's destruction, they extract the Space Stone from the Tesseract. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is subdued and Thanos kills Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and overpowers Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Heimdall (Idris Elba) transports Hulk to Earth before being killed, then Thanos and his lieutenants leave and the ship is destroyed. Hulk crash-lands at the Sanctum Sanctorum in New York City, reverting to Bruce Banner, there he meets Doctor Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Wong (Benedict Wong) and warns them of Thanos' plan to kill half of all life in the universe, so Strange recruits Tony Stark aka Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.). Maw and Obsidian arrive to retrieve the Time Stone from Strange, drawing the attention of Peter Parker aka Spider-Man (Tom Holland), Maw fails to take the Time Stone due to an enchantment, but captures Strange. Stark and Parker pursue Maw's spaceship, while Banner contacts Steve Rogers aka Captain America (Chris Evans), and Wong stays behind to guard the Sanctum. In Scotland, Midnight and Glaive ambush Wanda Maximoff aka Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Vision (Paul Bettany) in-order to retrieve the Mind Stone in Vision's forehead. Rogers, Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Sam Wilson aka Falcon (Anthony Mackie) rescue them and shelter with James Rhodes aka War Machine (Don Cheadle) at the Avengers Compound. Vision offers to sacrifice himself, to have the Mind Stone destroyed to keep Thanos from retrieving it, Rogers suggests they travel to Wakanda, which may have the resources to remove the stone without destroying Vision. The Guardians of the Galaxy respond to a distress call from the Asgardian ship and rescue Thor, he surmises Thanos seeks the Reality Stone, which is in the possession of the Collector (Benicio Del Toro) on Knowhere. Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and Groot (Vin Diesel) accompany Thor to Nidavellir, Thor is also given a new eye, on the now deserted planet they and Eitri, King of the Dwarves (Peter Dinklage), create an enchanted battle-axe called Stormbreaker capable of killing Thanos. On Knowhere, Peter Quill aka Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoë Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista) and Mantis (Pom Klementieff) find Thanos who has already got the Reality Stone in his possession. Thanos kidnaps Gamora, his adoptive daughter, she is forced to reveal the location of the Soul Stone as her captive adoptive sister Nebula (Doctor Who's Karen Gillan) is being tortured. Thanos and Gamora travel to Vormir, where Red Skull (Ross Marquand), keeper of the Soul Stone, informs him the stone can only be retrieved by sacrificing someone he loves, Thanos reluctantly throws Gamora off a cliff, granting him the Soul Stone. Nebula escapes captivity and asks the remaining Guardians to meet her on Titan, Thanos' destroyed homeworld, Stark and Parker have rescued Strange and killed Maw, ejecting him from his ship, they land at Titan and meet Quill, Drax, and Mantis. The group forms a plan to remove Thanos' Infinity Gauntlet, while Strange looks into the future, he finds only one in millions of possible futures in which Thanos loses. Thanos arrives, justifying his plan is necessary to ensure the survival of a universe threatened by overpopulation, the group manage to subdue him, until Nebula deduces that he killed Gamora. Quill is enraged and retaliates, allowing Thanos to break away and overpower the group, Strange surrenders the Time Stone in exchange for Thanos sparing Stark, Thanos then departs for Earth. In Wakanda, Rogers reunites with Bucky Barnes aka Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) before Thanos and his army invade, the Avengers, alongside T'Challa aka Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and the Wakandan forces, mount a defence while Shuri (Letitia Wright) works to extract the Mind Stone from Vision. Banner is unable to transform into the Hulk, he fights in Stark's Hulkbuster armour; Thor, Rocket, and Groot arrive to reinforce the defenders, while Midnight, Obsidian, and Glaive are killed, and their army is routed. Maximoff attempts to destroy the Mind Stone, but Thanos arrives and retrieves the stone from Vision, destroying him, Thor severely wounds Thanos, but with all stones completing the Infinity Gauntlet, Thanos activates it, clicking his fingers and teleporting away. Thanos' plan succeeds, as a result, half of all life across the universe disintegrates, including Barnes, T'Challa, Groot, Maximoff, Wilson, Mantis, Drax, Quill, Strange, and Parker; Stark and Nebula remain on Titan, while Banner, Okoye (Danai Gurira), Rhodes, Rocket, Rogers, Romanoff, M'Baku (Winston Duke), and Thor are left on Wakanda, meanwhile Thanos rests and recuperates on another planet. After the credits, Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders) witness many people disintegrating, causing destruction, Fury is able to transmit a distress signal before he and Hill disintegrate, the device displays a star insignia on a red-and-blue background (meaning Captain Marvel). Also starring Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts, William Hurt as Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross and Stan Lee as the Bus Driver. All of the cast as the superheroes are fantastic as usual, and Brolin is brilliant as the malevolent supervillain, there is a lot going on at once, but thankfully I followed it all, the special effects are spectacular, and the constant explosions and fight sequences are exciting, I wasn't expecting to end so dramatically and sombre, I cannot wait to see what happens next and how the heroes will be returned, overall this is a fantastic fantasy action adventure. It was nominated for Oscar for Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects. Very good!"", 'Given my reluctance towards superhero movies, then I have been putting off watching ""Avengers: Infinity War"" up until now. I just simply don\'t do well with flying men, guys with strength above and beyond all measures, and the like. But I still watch the movies when I get presented with a chance, because of the special effects and because they do tend to have quite good special effects.I was given the chance to watch ""Avengers: Infinity War"" now, so I took the time to sit down and watch it. And I dare say that this was actually the best of all superhero movies that I have watched to date.Why? Well, because of the storyline and plot. Because this was so much deeper than a bunch of narcissistic guys and girls in tight spandex running around trying to - and succeeding every time - in saving the world and people they don\'t know. ""Avengers: Infinity War"" had a more dark tinge to it and it was nice for a change to see that the superheroes weren\'t invincible and coming out unscathed from whatever villain they take on.And the plot does actually leave you with something to think about; what if Thanos actually wasn\'t a villain, but one set out to actually do something that is waiting to happen, to purge worlds and give them a fresh start, as worlds are becoming overcrowded and a hazard to themselves with the pollution and such? If you watch the movie with that mindset then it suddenly becomes a whole different experience.The sheer amount of superheroes put together in this movie must be an overload for fans of the genre, I believe. Because there was an abundance of superhero characters everywhere. And personally, I found it quite refreshing to see that many of them met with untimely demises at the hands of Thanos or as a product of his schemes.Granted this being a Marvel movie, the special effects were off the charts. If you, like me, don\'t enjoy superhero movies all that much, then at least watch it for the eye candy in form of CGI and effects on the screen. But ""Avengers: Infinity War"" offers more than just CGI, because it actually has a plot that is worth delving into. But back to the effects; there were so many things going on all over the screen, that I think the movie should be watched a second time. The first time you watch it for the story, the second time to take in all the special effects and happenings on the screen.The cast list was just phenomenal, and I am impressed that they can assemble these people again and again to reprise their roles. But of course, with the salaries they are being paid, who wouldn\'t reprise such characters?""Avengers: Infinity War"" actually presented a good and wholesome entertaining storyline that kept being interesting throughout the entire movie. I was more than entertained and was adequately surprised with the outcome of the movie.This might actually be just the kind of movie that persuades you to come to like the superhero genre.I was impressed, and that is saying a lot because I am definitely not a superhero fanboy.', ""A mean, ugly purple dude scours the universe for the pretty gems that fit into his snazzy metal gauntlet, intent on using the power of the stones for his own nefarious needs. It is up to a team of brave superheroes to try and stop him.I've fallen way behind on my MCU, and am probably not the best person to comment on this latest instalment; or maybe, just maybe, my objectivity makes me more suited than most avid fanboys.For the best part of two hours I was reasonably entertained by what unfolded, despite not knowing the backstory to several of the characters. The plot was pretty easy to pick up, the action scenes were visually impressive, and there was never a lull in pace. It was slick, big-budget popcorn fodder designed to appeal to the masses, but which hardly qualified as revolutionary or indeed, all that memorable. Eventually, I could feel tedium creeping in. And then the last act changed everything...The finalé, in which half the population of the entire universe ceases to exist, makes Avengers: Infinity War a movie that lingers in the mind long after it has ended. Spiderman, gone. Dr. Strange, gone. Black Panther, gone. Groot, gone. And many more besides. Well-established characters vanish in the blink of an eye, and I have to admit feeling a lump in my throat at their casual dismissal. It's a bold move, for sure, and one that will guarantee discussion from all that stay the distance (which reminds me, be sure to remain seated for the now obligatory after credits scene).6/10 for the first two hours or so, but that ending... I'll be generous and add a couple of extra points for Marvel having the balls to go ahead with it.***EDIT*** Having pondered the fate of so many superheroes, I now expect Marvel to bring most of them back to life in the next film via Dr. Strange's powers of time manipulation-not such a ballsy move after all. My rating might be reduced to 7/10 if this is the case.***"", 'The best thing about my watching this movie at home was the BluRay (from my public library) presentation, super video and audio. In the last Avengers movie the focus was on Ultron. Here the focus is on Thanos, played very well by Josh Brolin in motion capture to create a menacing character.What is lacking, for me, is a good story that unfolds nicely. As some reviewers have said, just putting large numbers of characters in a story doesn\'t necessarily make it a better movie. The story is pretty simple, Thanos wants to get all the infinity crystals, that will give him the power to destroy half of the universe, as a way of saving it from too large a population. But it often isn\'t easy to follow and understand the meaning of all the story elements that lead up to the final scenes. For action junkies this movie has lots of it. Almost nonstop action, fighting scenes, big battles, in fact often too much so that the mind becomes numb to additional gore.Now I see there is a ""an untitled"" Avengers movie in preparation for 2019. The franchise marches on.', ""If you've read my reviews on this site over the years, you must've known that I love superheros and especially Marvel ones. So when watching this with my movie theatre-working friend, we were very excited to watch all those awesome characters come together to fight one really Big Bad one who cannot be easily defeated by just any one of them, one who goes by the name of Thanos. I mean, at the very beginning, someone is already defeated and by the end, well, it's not pretty, that's for sure! That end also seems to be a cliffhanger for the inevitable sequel that I know has already been made and is due next year. Great mix of humor and drama! I and my friend really enjoyed it so on that note, yes, go watch Avengers: Infinity War if you haven't already!"", ""This film tells the story of the ensemble of Marcel superheroes uniting to fight against an evil man called Thanos.It is a joy just to watch the numerous famous faces in the film! The story is good, visuals are fantastic, and there are loads of fighting. It has all the elements of a blockbuster.However, the plot doesn't drive itself, and is not overly engaging because of the vast number of characters in different locations and subplots. It feels a bit fragmented to be. Still, I enjoyed the film a lot. By the way, the ending surprised me a little, and I guess we have to wait for the resolution of the story in the next Avengers gymf."", 'Non stop action but I was disappointed when they used the lords name in vain', ""The Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy combine forces to battle Thanos (Josh Brolin).

The CGI Is flawless, the action scenes are fast and furious and the story whizzes along. The movie does assume you've seen every Marvel comic book film to get the characters so be warned. The acting is great and the movie manages to juggle multiple characters and plots and still make sense. Can't wait for part 2! :)"", ""I was so anxious and anticipatory of this movie that I bought tickets for it a month in advance. I couldn't wait to see the culmination of the various chess moves Marvel had been making over the last 10+ years. How could this movie be anything short of spectacular?OK, I'd be lying if I said it was spectacular but it was darn good. One of the biggest questions I had going in was how Marvel would showcase the numerous talents. How could they possibly give adequate screen time to the important characters such as Captain America, Thor, Iron-Man, Spider Man, Hulk, Black Panther, Doctor Strange and the Guardians of the Galaxy? Not to mention the secondary characters such as Vision, Scarlet Witch, Black Widow, Falcon, War Machine and others. Then, what kind of villain... no, super-villain could Marvel cook up that would require the assembly of such talents?To the first question: I think they gave proper focus to the right characters. Some characters were more important than others and some had doper fight scenes than others (ahem, Iron Man, Spider Man, Doctor Strange) but they all got in on the action.To the second question: Thanos was not just a super villain, he was a super badass villain. He was so bad that even his henchmen could've been primary villains. Thanos was legendary status. He wasn't some amorphous super being, nor was he a science experiment gone wrong or just some very powerful maniac. Thanos was a force and his demeanor made him that much more sinister. He carried himself like he was destined for greatness and the steps to that greatness, however brutal, were just the necessary steps to get to where he needed to be. He was impressive to say the least.The movie was excellent even if it wasn't quite what I expected. We got to see some major upgrades from Iron Man and Spider Man. We got to see Avenger-like team work with cross-over characters. We got to see boss level heroism and self-sacrifice.  We got to see major moral dilemmas. And we got to see an inter-galactic plot. If you haven't seen the movie then prepare yourself and don't be angry with all that happens just be patient because this movie is just one more brilliant chess move by the MCU."", 'Disney\'s latest Marvel Studios\' blockbuster superhero epic ""Avengers: Infinity War"" finally gives us a villain we not only can love but also loath with equal passion because he considers himself the epitome of mercy. Few supervillains share Thanos\' warped point of view as well as his staggering supremacy. After several cameos in earlier Marvel epics, the long-awaited Thanos devastates everybody and everything in his path like an apocalypse. Just about every Marvel superhero shows up to hamper this doomsday juggernaut from looting the universe for those six ultra-powerful Infinity Stones that auger ill for the future. ""Captain America: Winter Soldier"" and ""Captain America: Civil War"" co-directors Joe and Anthony Russo and ""Captain America"" co-writers Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus have delivered a sequel that indisputably surpasses its predecessors, but it is debatable that Marvel can elevate the stakes much higher in later sequels for a villain as formidable as Thanos. Moreover, the greatest criticism many may raise is that their favorite Marvel superhero may have been short changed in this saga owing to a lack of time to streamline everybody into the storyline. Actually, most of the superheroes have more than enough time, while the peripheral entities, like Loki, perish in the first scene and those that ensue. Clocking in at a marathon two hours and 36 minutes, ""Avengers: Infinity War"" will challenge anybody\'s bladder. Unless you\'re a dialysis patient, you\'ll have to schedule your departures, so you\'ll miss either the least amount of high-octane action or expository dialogue. Back in the good ole days, Hollywood provided audiences with intermissions to purge their urges. Problem is the brothers Russo and their scenarists never squander a second in their narrative. Perhaps somebody will create an app that will enable us via Wi-Fi to watch on our smart phones what will would normally miss during flights to and from the lavatory. Meantime, the Russo Brothers maintain a straightforward, serious tone throughout this superhero mash-up, sprinkling the action with amusing quips, especially about Wakanda possibly getting a Starbucks Coffee Shop since Black Panther wants to open his homeland up to the world. No, ""Avengers Infinity War"" isn\'t a parody like ""Thor: Ragnarok."" Despite its abundant length, the filmmakers take enough time to update certain characters, such as Thor, and give us glimpses into the past about how Thanos saved a young Gamora. What may dishearten some Marvel fans is Thanos doesn\'t take a licking. Instead, he delivers the licking, taking down virtually every Marvel champion as irrevocably as a bowling ball smashing ten-pins during a strike. ""Avengers\' Infinity War"" picks up where ""Thor: Ragnarok"" left off. Thanos (Josh Brolin) boards the Asgardian spaceship with the Ragnarok survivors. Incidentally, he wears a helmet and uniform in a nod to Jim Starlin\'s graphic novel ""The Infinity Gauntlet"" (1991). He wears a massive gauntlet on his left fist that will eventually be encrusted with six stones. Thanos sheds the helmet. He vanquishes Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) in brief but brutal combat. He tortures Thor for the whereabouts of the Tesseract, and Loki (Tom Hiddleston) reluctantly surrenders it. Not only does Thanos dispatch Loki but also Heimdall. Before Heimdall (Idris Elba) dies, he summons the Bifrost and hurtles Hulk back to Earth. Once he possesses the Space stone, Thanos destroys the ship. Meantime, Hulk plunges into New York City. He has reverted to Bruce Banner. Worst, he cannot conjure up the Hulk. Thanos\' cronies invade New York. They hover above the Big Apple in a colossal ring-shaped spacecraft. Peter Parker (Tom Holland) is riding in a school bus, driven by Marvel honcho Stan Lee in his inevitable cameo, when this monstrosity appears over Manhattan. Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), Spider-man, Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) tangle with these sinister extraterrestrials that want Strange\'s Time stone. Eventually, our superheroes stow away onboard the departing alien ship, and Spider-man discovers that his new suit helps him survive. More of Thanos\' toadies rampage into Scotland to bring back the Mind stone embedded in Vision\'s forehead. Scarlett Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) fights alongside Vision (Paul Bettany) to repulse these wicked adversaries. In a riff on the rescue mission in ""Alien,"" the Guardians of the Galaxy receive a distress call. When they reach the scene of the destruction, they can only save Thor. The Guardians split into two groups, and Rocket Raccoon and Groot accompany Thor to the planet Nidavellir, where Eitri (Peter Dinklage) forges a replacement battle-axe christened Stormbreaker, so the son of Odin can intervene in a life-and-death fracas back on Earth in Wakanda. Captain America (Chris Evans), Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) confront more of Thanos\' subhuman armies out to get \'the Mind Stone.\' The creation of Thor\'s new hammer is exhilarating stuff. No matter what this army of superheroes does, Thanos manages to subjugate them at every turn. Eventually, once he has acquired all six stones, the Titan snaps his fingers, and half of the universe expires like dust in the wind. Barnes, Black Panther, Groot, Scarlet Witch, Mantis, Drax, Star Lord, Dr. Strange, and Spider-man dissolve into smoke. At one point, our heroes nearly relieve Thanos of the Infinity gauntlet, until Star Lord infuriates the purple giant. Ultimately, Iron Man, Thor, Banner, Rocket Raccoon, Captain America, and Black Widow survive this frightening Armageddon.Anybody familiar with Jim Starlin\'s ""The Infinity Gauntlet,"" the film\'s ostensible source material, knows the graphic novel and film share few similarities. For example, in the Starlin\'s ""Gauntlet,"" Thanos has acquired all six infinity gems from the start. Conversely, in the movie, Thanos embarks on a scavenger hunt for these essential crystals. The film jettisons Thanos\' futile infatuation with Mistress Death. More than thirty superheroes wind up on casualty list, and the Earth is catapulted out of orbit. Nevertheless, everything that Thanos did was undone. The biggest surprise about ""Avengers: Infinity War"" is the triumph of Thanos over the heroes. Presumably, the sequel will undo the evil Titan\'s victory.', 'Epic superhero team-up from Marvel Studios and directors Anthony & Joe Russo. When an alien named Thanos (motion capture and voice performance from Josh Brolin) begins to collect all six of the Infinity Stones, incredibly powerful artifacts that grant their possessor unimaginable abilities, it\'s up to the galaxy\'s greatest heroes to try and stop him. Original Avengers Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Captain America (Chris Evans) join forces with newcomers Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), Spider-Man (Tom Holland), Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and even the Guardians of the Galaxy, among others, but will their combined might be enough to stop Thanos\' apocalyptic plan? The culmination of plotlines 10 years in the making, this is one of the biggest gambles in movie history, and it seems to have paid off. The directors and screenwriters somehow manage to juggle this many characters and keep the balance just about right, with memorable moments doled out to all of them. The plot itself is very basic (""Stop Thanos""), and much time is spent on well-executed action scenes and eye-candy science fiction set-pieces. The dialogue is very humorous, and the various character combinations are amusing. There are usually three or four story directions going on at once, with the action switching from location to location frequently, but never in such a way as to become a distraction or disorienting. The biggest question mark of the film was how well Thanos would turn out, a villain that\'s been teased for the last 6 years in these movies. I was dubious about Brolin\'s casting, as while I like him in many things, he never struck me as intergalactic demi-god alien appropriate. I\'m happy to say that he works out fine, and while the effects work done on him is very good, his voice sells the character, arguably one of the best developed out of any of the Marvel movies thus far.I won\'t go into spoiler territory, but I will mention that the ending may befuddle or even anger some viewers. As a former comic book reader, I wasn\'t upset by it, and even expected it (even before the internet spoiled things for me). But those going in blind should be prepared for an unconventional finale.', 'Thanos(Brolin, giving us a layered villain, the best in recent years) has...*finally*... started to gather the Infinity Gems. If he gets all six he can wipe out half of the universe with a snap of his fingers. Will our heroes be able to stop him and his ""Children""?The hype for this was unreal. Many say that it couldn\'t live up to it. And I realise that a lot don\'t, and won\'t(as it premieres around the world), think it did. For my money(and they\'ll keep getting them as long as they keep making them this good), it delivered, and then some. Obviously, with so many major characters, they cannot possibly all get a lot of screentime. You could criticise their decision to include so many. Honestly, you\'re free to think so, but this is not a movie for you. Which is fine. I don\'t doubt that you love flicks that aren\'t for me. This is a cinematic version of an event comic, not decreased in scope as most of the adaptations of those stories are, something I\'ve been waiting for for 20 years to be done right. So rather than complain about something that couldn\'t be helped, let\'s look at whether it\'s satisfying. Personally, I absolutely think so. I\'ve loved most of these since I first saw these versions of them, and I felt that they were all featured to the right extent. Every single one of them makes an impact, most get arcs, not a single one feels like they\'re just in the background(as is the case with every single X-Men film).This wastes no time starting the plot, moves quickly, and introduces us to all the groups quite early on, and yet never feels overpowering. I realised the following is an old example, however, recently rewatching Revenge of the Sith, the difference is incredible. Both were built up to for years(at least 6 in both cases), and where that one is massively overcrowded, and quite tiring and tedious, this one isn\'t, even a little. I know. I can hardly believe it myself. It delivers on emotion, interaction between individuals, growth, in addition to action scenes(which, ultimately, is the bread and butter of a Summer blockbuster). Does it, outside of the bad guy\'s depiction, including personality and motivation, reach a level of depth akin to the solo adventures? No. It would be unrealistic to expect it to. It\'s not going for that. Finally, there has been a lot of reasonable concern, for how they would handle the supposed killing off of fan favorites. I\'m not giving away whether or not they do, or if it\'s only for bit parts. What I will say is that everyone who kicks the bucket in this, on either side of the conflict, gets to be memorable and important before they do. They were very smart and how they handled that. Like everything else in this.I recommend this to anyone who finds it to be appealing. Do note that the ending is very much a setup for the next one, and doesn\'t feel conclusive. It used to be called part 1 for a reason. And yes, that will disappoint many - and they\'re not wrong. Personally, I\'m just incredibly excited for Avengers 4. 10/10', ""AVENGERS : INFINITY WAR (2018) *** 1/2 Robert Downey, Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Scarlett Johansson, Don Cheadle, Benedict Cumberbatch, Tom Holland, Chadwick Boseman, Karen Gillan, Tom Hiddleston, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan, Idris Elba, Danai Gurira, Peter Dinklage, Benedict Wong, Chris Pratt, Pom Kiementieff, Dave Bautista, Zoe Sladana, Gwyneth Paltrow, Benicio Del Toro, William Hurt, Letitia Wright, Carrie Coon, Ross Marquand, (Voices of Josh Brolin, Bradley Cooper, Vin Diesel, and Kerry Condon ) Cameos: Samuel L.

Directed with brio by the Russo Brothers (Anthony & Joe) and well- cobbled screenplay by Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely manages to juggle the astronomically large cast of regulars mixing the right peppering of humor with drama, and proves to be a big game changer for its inevitable follow-up. See it on a big screen - IMAX for full effect."", 'Greetings again from the darkness. We are at the 10 year mark of the new Marvel cinematic universe that began with the revolutionary IRON MAN (2008). This 19th movie in the franchise is actually Part 1 of 2 films that will (supposedly) be the lasting legacy of The Avengers. The second ""half"", much of which was filmed simultaneously with this one, is set for 2019. Co-directing brothers Anthony Russo and Joe Russo were responsible for the two most recent Captain America movies (and also one of my all-time least favorites: YOU, ME AND DUPREE), and have now taken on the biggest budget, biggest cast, and longest run time yet of any Marvel movie. In fact, it\'s so big, it could only be named \'Infinity\'. Being that the fan base for this movie is highly sensitive to anything resembling a hint, much less a spoiler, this review will tread very lightly, and instead function as an overview with very general observations. There are a few key points, most of which are quite obvious from either the trailers or the previous movies in the series. First thing to realize is that this is a Thanos movie. He\'s the first big (I told you everything was big), bad, nearly omnipotent villain. It should be noted that Thanos sees himself as misunderstood, which leads to the second key point: melodrama abounds - moreso than any previous comic book movie. It seems to be reminding us that Superheroes are people too (but are they really?). The third point is that if every character with a speaking part simply said ""I am Spartacus"", it would still likely be the longest ever comic book movie. There are at least 28 characters with ""key"" roles - and that\'s not counting the end credit stinger, or the missing characters we thought we would see, or the one that gets a logo tease as a coming attraction for part 2. Co-writers Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus had their hands full in working to come up with a coherent story, while allowing so many familiar characters to have at least one moment in the spotlight, if not a few. The fact that AVENGERS: CIVIL WAR divided the group actually allows for multiple segments to play out concurrently. Though we never doubt these fragmented cliques and isolated individuals will fight to save the galaxy, that doesn\'t necessarily mean they get the band back together. In fact, it\'s the Guardians of the Galaxy who are a much more cohesive group than our beloved Avengers. But fear not ... there is plenty of fighting and action to go around.Thanos claims he is saving many interplanetary civilizations and restoring balance with his plan to eliminate half of all living beings. While there might be some scientific evidence to back up his plan, it doesn\'t sit well with the good guys. More focus is given to his cravings for ultimate control and power provided by tracking down all six Infinity Stones (Tesseract/Space, Mind, Time, Power, Reality, and Soul) to complete his Infinity Gauntlet. Many of these stones are in quite inconvenient locations and require some ingenuity and brute force from Thanos.Perhaps the travel agent had the biggest challenge as portions of the film take place in New York City, Knowhere, and Wakanda (good luck finding a brochure on those last two). We also get a budding romance from Vision and Scarlet Witch, as well as annoying quasi-romantic banter between Tony Stark and Pepper Potts. And while we are on the ""TMZ"" portion of the review, it should be noted that both Black Widow and Captain America (introducing himself as Steve Rogers) both have new hair styles - though only one of them sports a beard. In the realm of comic book movies, this would be considered an epic. It has stunning action sequences, remarkable special effects and some terrific comedy mixed in. Of course, you\'ll have to accept the melodramatic emotions and fear that we haven\'t been previously subjected, and know that the final finality doesn\'t arrive for another year. It\'s very long (more than 2 ½ hours) but it seems to go pretty quickly. The filmmakers have mostly succeeded in the monumental task of remaining true to the history in order to keep comic book fans satisfied, while also creating something that most should be entertained by. Despite lacking the upbeat, feel-good ending we\'ve grown accustomed to, there is a welcome Stan Lee cameo, a post credit stinger (after about 10 minutes of rolling credits). And to top it off, we get ""Rubberband Man"" from The Spinners. Now that\'s big!', 'RELEASED IN 2018 and directed by Anthony & Joe Russo, ""Avengers: Infinity War"" chronicles events when the Avengers team-up with several allies to defeat the cosmic despot Thanos, whose goal is to collect all six Infinity Stones to attain unimaginable power and radically solve one of the Universe\'s most challenging problems.The story focuses on Thanos, Thor and the Guardians of the Galaxy, especially Gamora, as well as Iron Man, Doctor Strange and Spider-Man. The rest of the cast members are more peripheral, e.g. Black Widow, Captain America, Black Panther, Vision and Scarlet Witch.This is easily the least of the Avengers trilogy. Not to mention ""Captain America: Civil War"" (2016) and ""Thor: Ragnarok"" (2017) are significantly more compelling and all-around entertaining. Actually, all three Thor flicks are palpably superior, as is ""Iron Man 2"" (2010). If you haven\'t already, I encourage you to watch these movies prior to viewing ""Infinity War,"" as well as ""Black Panther"" (2018) and the two ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" flicks (2014/2017); otherwise you\'ll likely be lost because all these movies lead up to this one.""Infinity War"" is certainly an ambitious comic book movie in that it notably juggles so many super-beings, but this lack of focus isn\'t conducive to suspense or great drama. It\'s merely decent with overkill CGI. The big battle in the closing act with the easily slaughtered four-armed dog-creatures is curiously dull; moreover, the attempts at humor sometimes feel forced and fall flat, but several jokes are laugh-out-loud funny, e.g. ""Rabbit."" Thankfully, the film adds moving drama and gets extra points for a bold, poignant climax, which sets up the 2019 sequel ""Endgame.""THE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours, 29 minute and was shot in New York City, Scotland and Philippines with studio work done in Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayetteville, Georgia. WRITERS: Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely.GRADE: B-', 'SPOILER: Thanos and his Children - Proxima Midnight, Ebony Maw, Corvus Glaive and Cull Obsidian - have attacked Thor\'s Asgardian ship in search of the Space Stone, which is housed in the Tesseract that Loki had stolen before Asgard\'s destruction. With Thanos already possessing the Power Stone after decimating Xandar, Thanos\' army swiftly defeats the Asgardians. After a futile counter-attack from the Hulk, Loki offers the Tesseract to Thanos in exchange for Thor\'s life - only to be killed himself when Thanos anticipates Loki\'s attempt to betray and kill him. Moments before Glaive kills him, Heimdall uses the power of the Bifrost to send Hulk to Earth. Thanos and his Children then depart just after Thanos uses the Power stone to destroy the ship, leaving a mourning Thor behind and stranded in space.Hulk crash lands at the Sanctum Sanctorum in New York City and is reverts back to Bruce Banner, who informs Stephen Strange and Wong about Thanos\' impending arrival. Strange and Banner contact Tony Stark and brief him about the Infinity Stones and Thanos. Realizing they must find Vision to protect the Mind Stone embedded in his head, Stark realizes he must make contact with Steve Rogers to find Vision, who has gone off the grid with Wanda Maximoff. Just then, Maw and Obsidian arrive in New York to seize the Time Stone from Strange, and Stark, Strange, Wong and Peter Parker confront them. Having been traumatized by his defeat at the hands of Thanos, Banner finds himself unable to transform into the Hulk and help in the battle. Maw incapacitates and captures Strange; Stark and Parker pursue his spaceship off Earth while Wong stays behind to protect the Sanctorum. Banner contacts the rest of the Avengers.In Scotland, where Wanda Maximoff and Vision have been hiding, the two are ambushed by Midnight and Glaive, but Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff and Sam Wilson fight them off. They decide to seek shelter in the Avengers Facility in Upstate New York, where they meet James Rhodes, who is once again mobile with bionic leg braces. Vision proposes that Maximoff destroy the Stone in his forehead to keep Thanos from retrieving it. Wanda immediately refuses however Rogers suggests that they travel to the one place that has the technology to safely remove the stone from Vision without killing him: Wakanda.Thor is rescued by the Guardians of the Galaxy, who had picked up the Asgardian ship\'s distress call. Thor guesses that Thanos would next be after the Reality Stone, which is in the possession of the Collector in Knowhere, but first he must retrieve a new weapon capable of killing Thanos from the dwarven planet of Nidavellir, where the only forge that can create such a weapon exists. Thor orders Rocket with him to Nidavellir, while Peter Quill, Gamora, Drax and Mantis travel to Knowhere. On the way there, Gamora talks to Quill, making him promise to kill her if the situation presents itself. Quill reluctantly promises he will. In Knowhere, Thanos ambushes the Guardians, having already retrieved the Reality Stone and created an illusion of an intact Knowhere to trap them. He captures Gamora after a crucial moment when Gamora begs Quill to kill her, using the Space Stone to escape. Thanos reveals that he knows that Gamora already knows the location of the Soul Stone after prying information from a tortured Nebula. Nebula escapes and signals the remaining Guardians to meet her on Titan, Thanos\' home world. Thanos and Gamora travel to the planet of the Soul Stone, Vormir, where the Red Skull, the Stone\'s keeper, informs him that retrieving the Stone carries a heavy price: it can only be retrieved by sacrificing the life of someone he truly loves. Despite his reluctance, Thanos tearfully throws Gamora off a tall cliff to her death and is granted the Soul Stone.Stark and Parker rescue Strange from Maw\'s torture chamber, and launch Maw out of the ship, killing him. Strange believes they should retreat to protect the Time Stone but Stark disagrees; he believes they should take the fight to Thanos instead of retreating like they\'ve done in the past. The three leave to confront Thanos on Titan, where they meet Quill, Drax and Mantis and formulate a plan to remove Thanos\' gauntlet. While discussing their tactics, Strange uses the Time Stone to view alternate futures, telling them he\'d seen 14,000,605 of them, with only one where the Avengers win. Thanos teleports to Titan, where, after a brief conversation with Strange meant to distract him, the group engage Thanos hand-to-hand and manage to subdue him. Mantis is able to calm Thanos while Peter and Tony attempt to pry the gauntlet from his arm. Quill and Nebula, who\'d arrived on Titan during the battle, deduce that Gamora is dead; an enraged Quill retaliates, hitting Thanos and breaking the group\'s hold on him. Thanos takes the gauntlet back and defeats the group, threatening to kill Stark unless Strange gives him the Time Stone. Strange does so and tells Tony they\'ve ""entered the end game."" Thanos adds the stone to his gauntlet and departs Titan.Thor, Rocket and Groot arrive at an abandoned and desolate Nidavellir. Thor is puzzled that the giant forge is inactive. The giant dwarf Eitri tells them that Thanos forced the dwarves to create his gauntlet; in return, Thanos killed all the dwarves except for Eitri. After laboring to reactivate the forge and reignite the neutron star that powers it, the four create Stormbreaker, a battle axe that serves as Thor\'s new weapon and grants him the power of the Bifrost. Meanwhile, the Avengers arrive in Wakanda and task Shuri with safely extracting the Mind Stone from Vision. Thanos\' Outrider army arrives and begins attacking Wakanda, and the Avengers, alongside the united Wakandan armies led by King T\'Challa, mount a defense against Thanos\' forces. Glaive infiltrates Shuri\'s lab and attacks Vision. The Outriders begin overwhelming the defending armies before Thor, Rocket and Groot arrive to join the battle. The tide seems to be turning for the Avengers, Midnight, Obsidian and Glaive are killed, but Thanos arrives for the Mind Stone. A tearful Maximoff destroys the still-implanted Mind Stone in Vision to prevent Thanos from retrieving it, but Thanos uses the Time Stone to reverse the event and pry out the Mind Stone from Vision, killing him again. Thor attacks and drives Stormbreaker into Thanos\' chest, but Thanos survives long enough to snap his fingers with the gauntlet. On a faraway world he finds Gamora as a child. When he confirms that he achieved his goal, she asks him what it cost. His answer is ""Everything."" Back on Earth, Thor looks on in horror as Thanos, his gauntlet now battered from the effort and his left arm and part of his chest burned, teleports away.Thanos\' goal of eradicating half of all life in the universe comes to fruition as people begin disintegrating: Bucky Barnes, T\'Challa, Groot, Maximoff, Wilson, Mantis, Drax, Star Lord, Strange & Parker all turn to ash and fade away. In Wakanda, only Rogers, Thor, Banner, Romanoff, James Rhodes, Rocket, Okoye and M\'Baku remain of the heroes. On Titan, only Nebula and Stark are left alive. Thanos awakens on another lush, green planet, his chest wound healed, and serenely watches the sunset, smiling slightly, satisfied at having achieved his ultimate goal.In a post-credits scene, the Earth is in chaos as people begin dissolving into ash; driver-less cars crash on the street and a helicopter is seen crashing into a skyscraper and exploding. Former S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Nick Fury and Deputy Director Maria Hill witness the scene on the street before they dissolve themselves. Before he vanishes, Fury manages to send a final distress signal to Captain Marvel.']"

A really important movie for the MCU as it introduces the quantum realm which links heavily into Endgame. It was much better than the first. The first movie was very kiddish in tone where this, although still aimed at a younger audience, was still a bit more adult and credible. There were some really funny moments in this. Rudd was superb and his trio of friends great. I also really like Douglas. Lilly makes a great wasp but my only criticism really was that it really championed her as being the capable hero and Ant Man's Rudd as being a bit of a loser and buffoon. Not cool.

The movie starts Paul Rudd, Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas and Michael Pena in their respective roles from the first movie. Scott Lang's ability to return from the quantum realm makes Hank Pym and Hope Pym believe that they can retrieve Janet Van Dyne from the quantum realm she was trapped in following events in the past. Scott Lang is placed under house arrest following the aid he gave to Captain America during Captain America: Civil War and must navigate around the law.Ant-Man and the Wasp is an entertaining movie. The charm and the fun from the first movie is here. Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly have good chemistry on the screen. The two are able to play off of the funny dialogue they are given. Likewise Michael Pena is hilarious as Luis. His fast-talking explanations and quick cut montages are fun to watch. Likewise there are many situations that are fun to watch like Scott Lang's Ant-Man suit malfunctioning causing him to be child-sized in an elementary school.There is not a lot of action in this movie an the movie does well from this as it can focus on its great leads. Even the side characters like Bill Foster played by Laurence Fishburne are a joy to watch. The effects in this movie have been well-done. This movie looks better than the other stand-alone Marvel movies. The shrinking effects look good. The quantum realm and tardigrades look trippy. The phasing of Ghost looks amazing as it always seems she is in several frames at once.The problem with the movie is its lack of consequences. From the beginning of the movie to the end of its run-time, noting of true consequence happens. Janet Van Dyne is retrieved from the quantum realm and that is it. Every conflict in between is manufactured to make the movie engaging rather than to have it develop organically. For example, the conflict with Ava Starr/Ghost is pointless because Janet Van Dyne is able to help her after she escapes the quantum realm. There was no reason for Ghost to be opposed to the Pym plans from the start as it was always going to be the case that they would help Ghost after they retrieved Janet. The only event of consequence in the movie happens at the end with Ant-Man being trapped in the quantum realm after Janet, Hank, and Hope fade to dust from Thanos' snap in Avengers: Infinity War.Ant-Man and the Wasp is a fun movie to watch. It is recommended to all audiences. However to those expecting a movie with significant plot developments in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, these audiences should look elsewhere.Grade: B."", 'The gang has returned to this series.Scott is under house arrest as a result of his actions in Captain America: Civil War. However, trouble arises when fresh opponents approach him. As a result, he seeks assistance from Hope Van Dyne (Henry\'s daughter), who obtains the Wasp suit. First and foremost, Scott\'s suit was ""totally"" damaged. But, in Cassie\'s trophy, his suit was fine towards the middle of the film. That\'s all right.Ghost (a.k.a. Ava Starr) and Sonny Burch are his adversaries this time. Not until Bill Foster appears as the main enemy. It\'s strange to put Bill in the role of enemy.Not only that, but Janet Van Dyne makes her first appearance in the MCU. Her comeback (which originally emerged in Scott\'s body) was fantastic. But I\'m looking forward to her next appearance in Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania.The gang\'s performance was improved this time, but the addition of Laurence Fishburne and Michelle Pheiffer makes the film rather interesting.', ""Ant-Man and The Wasp is a fun adventure for the characters. The cast has great chemistry, which is assisted by the admirable comedic portions of the film. The visuals are well done, with great editing to help capture the different fight and other intense sequences. A little character development is lacking, but it doesn't take much away from the plot. The overall storyline is exciting and has a nice emotional depth, but does sometimes fall short of being completely eye grabbing. Otherwise, the movie is a worthy addition to the MCU."", 'In one of the sweetest scenes in ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"", Ant-Man\'s human persona Scott, played by kind resilient Paul Rudd, sits legs crossed on the bedroom floor with his 10 year-old daughter Cassie, played by cute innocent Hannah John-Kamen. Scott is so sorry for making a mess in his heroic circumstance. Cassie says, ""It\'s not dumb to help people."" For Director Peyton Reed\'s sequel ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" scale truly does matter. In the story by the mini-army of Writers Chris McKenna, Erik Sommers, Paul Rudd, Andrew Barrer, and Gabriel Ferrari, our Superheroes Ant-Man and Wasp, played by Evangeline Lilly, are not out to save the world, much less the Universe like other Marvel Movies. The scale matters. ""Ant-Man and Wasp"" is smaller, less noisy. There\'s no threat of global Armageddon. There are spectacular chase scenes in San Francisco with ""Goliath"" Ant-Man, and cinematic kaleidoscope tunneling into the Quantum Realm. Instead the captivating thread is Hope Van Dyne, played by beautiful strong Evangeline, risking her life to find her long lost Mother Janet, played by radiant wise Michelle Pfeiffer, in the Quantum Realm. Paul\'s Scott, who returned from the Quantum Realm in ""Ant-Man"" holds the key to that possible resurrection.""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" revels in its quirk, not so much in the ostentatious CGI expanding and shrinking effect. Although, the cool martial arts fight scenes with Wasp and new adversary, the phasing Ghost, played by tortured charismatic Hannah John-Kamen, is high impact awesome. Scott unintentionally channels Janet, gifting clues about her location. Scott as Janet holds the hand of her Husband Hank Pym, creator of Ant-Man and Wasp, played by whimsical Michael Douglas. The look on Hank\'s face is hysterical. As Scott gently caresses Janet\'s daughter Hope\'s face, that\'s the Mother\'s love. Rudd, Lilly, and Douglas brilliantly play light-hearted, yet never forget that what matters is family. Michelle is sublime gravitas. Too bad the story didn\'t call for more screen time. ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" begins with Scott under house arrest after his heroics with The Avengers in ""Captain America: Civil War"". This also explains his disappearance in ""Infinity War"". He has nightmares of his stint in the ubiquitous Quantum Realm, while sharing custody of his daughter Cassie. Because of his Avengers debacle as Ant-Man, Scott\'s now estranged from Hank and his daughter Hope. That\'s until Hope discovers Scott\'s possible link to her Mother. Scott and Hope are in love with each other, but not always in phase. So to speak. In this needlessly convoluted narrative, Scott joins forces with Hank and Hope to retrieve Janet. Powerful assassin Eva, also called Ghost, arises threatening their mission. Eva suffers excruciating pain: Her molecules continual regenerate in her phasing curse. Her cure may also resolve in that Quantum Realm. The imaginative movie action dazzles along with the visual effects. Really, it is the personal scale of ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" that resonates. The young woman wants to find her beloved Mother. The husband wants to be with the love of his life. The young daughter believes in her Dad reminding him, ""You can do anything."" ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" is fun exhilarating Summer fare that\'s also about family and those close. After all: It\'s not dumb to help people.', ""After Avengers: Infinity War I was worried that anything that would come after for Marvel would be underwhelming but I was wrong because AntMan and the wasp used the same formula as the last Ant man movie which was that it was a small story and a family oriented story inside a superhero movie.The Whole premise is Janet Van Dym Hank Pym's wife is trying to get saved from the Quantam while AntMan is underhouse arrest.The story was simple enough and built Aroundt which is why it was so good.The first act was a tad slow but not boring is it set up where the characters are and had some fun action especially with the introduction of the Wasp.The second act was a kind of boring with the pace diping and nothing exciting happening.The third act picked up the pace and the chunk of the action was in the last 30 minutes so that was my favorite part.The villain or antagonist of the movie Ghost wasn't bad but not really that interesting she has a reason to be there but didn't add anything significant with the plot expect for fancy powers which made for good effects.Michael Douglas' performance amd Pual Rudd were the best characters in the movie as they were serious when needed to be and funny when needed to be.The Wasp as I said was cool with as a good enough performance from lilly.Michelle Pfeiffer did well in the role she was given and had good chemistry in the scenes she had with Michael Douglas.Antman and the Wasp was funnier than the first one but of course its Marvel but It had some out of place humor that took away from the serious moments but of course again its Marvel.This had more action as well but mainly in the last 40 minutes or so because as I said the second act was mostly slow and kind of dragged on.So what to take away from all of this is that Antman and the wasp is similar to Back to the Future its funny,has a story with a heart and just a plain fun blockbuster."", 'Ant-Man and the Wasp is an awe-inspiring film. Director Peyton Reed has maintained all the quirks, gags, one-liners & unique action, that made Ant-Man(2015) such a thoroughly enjoyable movie.', ""If you love shallow movies.There isn't any depth in this movie. The jokes, story, villains, subplots. It all falls flat. It all one-dimensional. We have a mysterious-looking antagonist named Ghost, but she doesn't have a layer, she can't be mysterious, and at one point she serves up a clot of over complicated exposition that gives the film little bit action. You don't care if she'll accomplish her goal or not. You don't even care which side is going to win. We have lots of jokes, but they're all stale. If you find this humour funny, I'm sorry, I just can't take the movie seriously. While some ''intense'' interrogation scene was going on someone's cell is ringing with a joke sound. And this call is in this movie just because to be there - just because to be ''funny''. It doesn't have any contribution to the story or the storytelling, it just there like that Russian family from Justice League. We have a story that concerns a rescue mission. But there isn't any complexity or twist that blows the audience away. Just flat. You could easily predict what's going to happen next. We have a subplot concerning a romantic relationship between Antman and the Wasp, but there isn't much, it just teases us around, and that's all. We have another subplot concerning a lovely relationship between a dad and his 10 years old daughter, which is not very well developed but still a little bit heartwarming because it's a relationship between a dad and his 10 years old daughter.While a woman who is in constant physical and emotional pain is trying not to die, the movie is trying to be funny. Peyton Reed maybe should've gone for the head, not chest. But then again, he can't, Disney has the strings. It got to try to be colorful, amiable, ''funny'' with forced jokes and fake actings. I really wonder when Marvel and Disney are going to take some risks and make a groundbreaking superhero movie. I guess never. Critics fine with eating the same turd for 10 years.There isn't any climax, or depth, or emotion. Just a filler movie with no heart and soul.PS. Amazing FBI work right there. It was too realistic for this movie 10/10"", ""Ant-Man and Wasp was a fun movie. Whereas I didn't see it strongly bolstering the MCU, it didn't harm the MCU at all. I like that they gave Ant-Man a partner (I dare not say sidekick) with similar, yet better abilities.Now, as for what I wish would've been different/better: the nemesis, Ghost. Ghost has some excellent skills and abilities which I think they (the production team) could've/should've explored more. I mean, the ability to phase in and out almost at will thereby giving the person the ability to pass through solid matter (kinda like Kitty Pride of the X-Men)--that makes for some spectacular fight scenes and other mischief. I'm imagining a fight similar to the opening scene of X-Men 2 when Nightcrawler infiltrated the White House. I know that phasing in and out is different than teleporting but in tight quarters they can be used similarly.That was my only gripe, which was a small one. Besides wanting more from the bad guy I thought the movie was funny and creative."", ""Having enjoyed a vast majority of Marvel's superhero output (more so than most) without worshipping them, 'Ant-Man' was a minor effort from them but there was still a good amount to like about it. Despite being positively received by critics, 'Ant-Man and the Wasp' as of now has received also heavy criticism from fans and some Marvel non-fans, so was conflicted in seeing it.'Ant-Man' and its slightly superior follow-up 'Ant-Man and the Wasp' managed to be better than expected. 'Ant-Man and the Wasp' to me was not as great as critics are saying, but it is also nowhere near as bad as people here have said, while sharing a few of their criticisms. Do like the character of Ant-Man. He is not exactly a household name and is always tossed aside in favour of other superhero characters like Spiderman that have had longer longevity and perhaps have more compelling origins and stories, hence why they are adapted more. Also wasn't sure what to make of the trailer, which made the film out to be rather bland in story and too reliant on humour while being very well made, directed and acted with thrilling action and funny and clever moments.Seeing it for myself, 'Ant-Man and the Wasp' could have been better and has its faults, ones that are somewhat the same as the first 'Ant-Man' and somewhat what was expected from watching the trailer. The script is mostly fine, but has patchy moments, namely the overly-wordy and sometimes over-complicated jargon and inconsistent humour. While the humour mostly works wonders, there are a few instances where it's not so funny and not very well placed.Such as in emotional scenes that are actually quite poignant and heart-warming (more so generally than 'Ant-Man')and then interrupted by a joke that is not only forced and unfunny but also not belonging in the scene, though more sporadically thankfully than before. The family scenes are a mixed bag, sometimes they are sweet and touching, the chemistry is more believable here, while at other times they're a little flat and predictable, contributing towards a few rare dull stretches in a film that generally is appropriately lighter in tone and faster paced.Like many people here, also found the villains underwhelming. Burch is especially pointless and forgettable and only really there because there seemingly needed to be an obligatory villain when actually there could have been just one. 'Thor Ragnarok' and 'Infinity War' only had one major one, and they, especially Thanos were the best villains in the Marvel canon. Ghost fares a little better and is an improvement over Corey Stoll's under-characterised villain in the first 'Ant-Man', her problem was that her back-story was very rushed and didn't feel developed enough. Michelle Pfeiffer is wasted in a very underwritten plot-device role.On the other hand, 'Ant-Man and the Wasp' is a great looking film, it's beautifully shot, very atmospheric, is very slick and the special effects, are clever and of the usual high-quality Marvel standards. The music avoids being over-bearing, one-note, too quirky or too bombastic, fitting well tone, mood and pace-wise. Direction is more than competent, keeping the story going at a solid pace and the telling of it interesting enough, though maybe a little more flavour may have been more welcome. While the action is not as much as most Marvel films, it is fun, thrilling, nicely choreographed and tautly shot and edited, especially towards the end. The stuff with sizes was clever visually and interested and entertained while the film is better than a lot of sequels in being consistent in the continuity.There is some very smart and hugely entertaining scripting and dialogue here in 'Ant-Man and the Wasp' too. While it doesn't work completely seamlessly, 'Ant-Man and the Wasp's humour when it works is some of the funniest stuff of all Marvel films, and the film doesn't take itself too seriously or too much of a joke either, instead not being afraid to embrace the silliness and humour while ensuring still that the subject matter is treated with respect. The truth serum and the feminine side being brought out parts were hilarious. The story is mostly diverting, it's and the first 'Ant-Man' film are narratively simpler than most Marvel outings and less risks here are taken than most Marvel films but it always makes sense, moments of dullness and jarring are few (while not being completely absent either), it's fun and it doesn't try to do too much or try to insert too many characters.While not complex as such, the characters are mostly engaging, with the reservations being with the villain and Pfeiffer's character. Paul Rudd is a strong and hugely entertaining lead, while Michael Peña's hilarious in a role that could have been really annoying. The seasoned support of a distinguished Michael Douglas adds hugely too, and Evangeline Lilly and Abby Ryder Fortson give the film some much needed heart. Hannah John-Kamon does command the screen and Walton Goggins has an oily presence that is more than what the forgettable and useless character deserved.Overall, not one of Marvel's best and has its flaws but a good sequel and film with many great things. 7/10 Bethany Cox"", 'Ant-Man has literally become one of the most important characters of the whole MCU!', ""Ant-Man helps Hank Pym and Hope van Dyne search for Janet who is lost in the quantum realm.This is an enjoyable movie that works better in the overall narrative of the Marvel Cinematic Universe than it does as a stand-alone feature.The search for Janet is a good, simple idea for the main plot, but it is slightly cluttered by some character moments, such as the backstory of the main antagonist and the reappearance of other side villains. The connection between Scott Lang and Janet is also somewhat dubious. However, the significance of developing the concept of the quantum realm is important in the bigger picture of the MCU 'infinity stones' era and this is where strength of its storytelling lies.Personally I do not take the issue with minor story problems in a movie played so much for laughs. Humour is a big part of 'Ant-Man and the Wasp' and the verbal and sight gags all work for me. Actors like Paul Rudd, Michael Peña and Randall Park are gifted comedic performers and I enjoy listening to their banter here. The dialogue is well written and performed by all.Visually it is similar to the original 'Ant-Man' with hugely fun and thrilling effects-driven sequences. It mixes the large and small worlds perfectly to create great spectacle.The more straight actors such as Michael Douglas, Evangeline Lilly, Lawrence Fishburne, Michelle Pfeiffer and Hannah John-Kamen are on good form. Abby Ryder-Fortson is great once more as Cassie.I think it has one of the best mid-credit sequences of any MCU movies and it is essential to watch this prior to seeing 'Avenger: Endgame'.Overall I prefer it to the original as there is less of the obvious exposition dialogue and importantly it held my 5 year old daughter for the full duration."", 'One of my favorite MCU films so far, this film combines comedy and whimsy to create a very fun experience.Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), after the events of the last Ant-Man film, considers the possibility of rescuing his wife from the Quantum Realm. He and daughter Hope (Evangeline Lilly) worked in the two years Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) has been under house arrest to produce the necessary technology. When they attempt to buy the last item needed, they come up against three new adversaries, including a mysterious ghost-like figure played by Hannah John-Kamen.Pym\'s technology that allows things to shrink or grow is fertile ground for whimsical scenes and wonderment. The writers take full advantage of it in this episode.As in the last episode, Rudd gets to voice many of the comedic lines. But the writers added several other characters who are quirky or inept, allowing for even more humor. One of the funniest scenes involves a reputed ""truth serum"" being administered to Lang\'s sidekick, Luis (Michael Pena).Like the last Ant-Man film, this one adds little to the overall Marvel story line, but it is quite enjoyable.', 'This is SUCH a funny film annnnnd cant wait for Antman 3!', 'I watched this movie as a part of my marathon to see all the MCU movies after Infinity War came up. Technically Infinity War was as far as I was going to have my marathon, but by the time I reached that point, this movie had also come out. So I saw this also. It felt a bit out of place considering there were two very heavy movies one after another (Black Panther and Infinity War), because of which it looked like a balloon compared to those anvils. But at the same time it was at least better than Captain Marvel so it gets some browny points from my side.Ant-Man and the Wasp is a very hilarious movie to say the least. I just love how the Ant-Man series always shows things to look very dramatic when they are tiny but they are actually very miniscule events when it happens in the real size. There are many emotional scenes too, as the premise of this movie is entirely about Scott trying to find the Janet, Hank\'s wife whom he presumed dead after all these years since they last went on a mission together. The very beginning of the movie itself begins from an emotional scene with little Hope saying her final goodbye to her mother. She is occasionally contacted by a ghost as a part of her dreams, which later turns out to be her mother.Meanwhile Scott has been put under house arrest for being on Captain America\'s side in Civil War. So he has to manage looking like he\'s at home while he\'s out there saving the day. I really liked how the bad guys literally steal Hank\'s office by just shrinking it, picking it up and walking away. The bad guys are also comical, especially the Indian one who says ""This is not truth serum! There is no such thing as a truth serum!"". The comedy scenes in the movie completely outshine the sad scenes, which I can say with a guarantee since I watched this movie 2 years ago and I only remember the good parts of it.There are of course a couple of things I didn\'t really like in this movie. First of all, the regular MCU problem - a dozen jump cuts in every fight scene. Why do they have to do this? All the fight scenes would havelooked not just cool, but even iconic if they didn\'t do that. Secondly even the dire moments get overshadowed by the funny moments when they don\'t have to be. Like when Hope finally meets Janet there is a joke immediately after. I get the movie is trying to keep the ""Ant-Man"" touch to it constantly, but this is going too far. And lastly, the post credit scene was so awesome, but it got ruined in Endgame. I know it\'s not this movie\'s fault but rather Endgame\'s fault for doing that, but these movies were planned together so if they knew this would have such an anticlimactic end they shouldn\'t have done it.I can absolutely guarantee you that Ant-Man and the Wasp will only leave you with good memories. There is no absolutely bad thing that happens in it, and it manages to retain the humour, cinematography and sotryline that one would expect from a Marvel Cinematic Universe movie.', ""It brilliantly executes the one thing everyone needed after what happened in Infinity War: lots of action and fun! Hope had the most wonderful action scenes in the movie. Cassie stands out with her cuteness and connection with Scott. Paul Rudd delivered excellently from drama, to comedy. The supporting cast is so strong for this movie. Finally Ghost is one of the best ANTagonist in the MCU. There's emotion and you will have a dilemma about this character. Overall, a great movie."", 'Movie was a lot of fun and a nice, comedic break from the dramatic heights of infinity war. Very funny with great action scenes and does a good job of further diving into the ""quantum realm"". Storyline a little inconsistent but over all great marvel movie!', 'Ant man and the Wasp is a successful sequel that contains comical moments like the first movie. The special effects and storytelling add elements of science into the MCU. We can see the film being more creative with the idea of ""Pym Particles"" where objects are being enlarged and downsized more frequently. One great thing about the film is the relationship between Hope and her mother, Janet. Like Christopher Nolan\'s Interstellar, this film explore the idea of love extending beyond space and time, and the writers did so with the details that were already established in the story. The relationship between the main two female characters can be described as a game of hide and seek, Hope\'s motivation in the film is simply finding her motivation her, like how she always lost the game in her childhood. But all movie came with imperfection. Once again, like the previous film, Hank Pym\'s character is poorly developed. The film villian Ghost, exist because of him being a jerk at the first place by not acknowledging her father\'s work. Yet the conflict between the characters resolved without Pym being forced to change. He was the same egotistic douche described in his youth at the end the of film. There were no apologies or struggles or choices touched to change his character. Generally, the film is entertaining to watch. It\'s my personal favorite Marvel in 2018. Since the film is dedicated to the main characters, the recently reunited family\'s death were made sadder than the ones in the Infinity War.', 'The film opens in 1987 as Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and his wife Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) are set to go on a mission, leaving their young daughter Hope (Madeleine McGraw) in the care of their housekeeper. As Ant-Man and the Wasp, they shrink themselves to stop a Soviet nuclear missile from detonating inside American territory. Finding that they can\'t shrink small enough to slip between the steel plates, Janet goes subatomic to drop the missile into the ocean, but it left her lost in the Quantum Realm, and she was presumed dead. However, after Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), as the new Ant-Man, went sub-atomic and managed to return to normal size, Hank tells Hope (now played by Evangeline Lilly) that there might be a way to bring Janet back.In the present day, Scott has been under house arrest after violating the Sokovia Accords by working with Captain America in Stuttgart, Germany. He is spending his day with Cassie (Abby Ryder Fortson), who is visiting him for the day. Scott has a whole area set up with the help of Luis (Michael Pena) in his house for them to play in, including a slide that goes out the door. Unfortunately, Scott\'s foot breaks through the fence and therefore the perimeter, and the FBI pays him a visit. Agent Jimmy Woo (Randall Park) leads the inspection to make sure Scott isn\'t doing anything suspicious. Scott explains that he\'s had to get creative to entertain Cassie, including doing sleight-of-hand magic, which impresses Woo. The FBI leaves, and Cassie goes home with Maggie (Judy Greer) and Paxton (Bobby Cannavale).With only three days left under house arrest, Scott does what he can to keep himself occupied. He takes a bath and then has a dream where he finds himself as Janet playing Hide and Seek with a young Hope. Scott later gives Hank a call, despite both he and Hope not having spoken to him since his arrest. He tells Hank about the dream he saw. Hours later, Scott is tranquilized by something flying in the room.Scott wakes up to find Hope driving him somewhere in a shrunken van. She lets him know that she took off his ankle bracelet and put it on the giant ant Scott has living with him. They arrive at the lab where they show Scott that they have created a tunnel to the Quantum Realm in the hopes of bringing Janet back. After Scott describes his dream in full detail, Hank and Hope deduce that he and Janet are connected because of the time he spent in the Quantum Realm. They are missing a key electronic component to get the tunnel to work, so they head to meet with someone who possesses it. Hank shrinks the lab and takes it with him. However, they don\'t realize they are being watched by a transparent figure.The three arrive at a restaurant where Hope meets with Sonny Burch (Walton Goggins), a black market tech dealer, while Scott and Hank monitor the situation from inside the van. Burch knows Hope as ""Susan"", but he has already figured out her identity by the time she arrives. Burch refuses to give up the component that Hope needs, so she appears to leave. Burch and his goons start to walk out, but they are knocked around by Hope in her Wasp suit. Scott is impressed to see that she has wings and blasters. She fights them in the restaurant\'s kitchen and manages to enlarge a salt shaker to knock out one goon while also running across knives being thrown at her. As Hope grabs the component, she is attacked by the figure from earlier, Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen). She is able to phase through anything, which means Hope\'s punches are useless against her. Scott joins Hope as Ant-Man in a new suit to help her, but Ghost escapes and makes her way to the van and steals the lab from Hank.Scott brings Hope and Hank to hide at X-Con, the security company run by Luis, with Dave (Tip ""T.I."" Harris) and Kurt (David Dastmalchian) as his employees. There, they try to come up with a plan to get the lab back. Hank figures that he has to reluctantly seek help from a former friend and partner of his, Bill Foster (Laurence Fishburne).Ghost, whose real name is Ava, goes to her home. She phases involuntarily and must sleep inside a special chamber to control it.Scott, Hope, and Hank go in disguise to the university that Bill teaches at. He maintains a grudge with Hank over the work they did together decades earlier, Project Goliath, in which Bill reached 21 feet. Scott then sees Woo and his fellow agents outside, thinking they know he\'s in there. Before they go, Bill tells them that they can locate the lab by modifying a defractor on one of the suit\'s regulators. Hank says they can\'t use the new Ant-Man suit because it\'s a work-in-progress, so Scott tells them they can find it in the older suit, which is in a trophy that Cassie took to school for show-and-tell.Scott and Hope sneak into Cassie\'s school, but the regulator on Scott\'s suit malfunctions, making him the size of a child. They get to Cassie\'s classroom and get the suit out of the trophy before they are spotted.The trio locate Ava\'s home and find the lab, but she knocks all three of them out and has them tied up. She reveals she is working with Bill, who took her in as a child. Her father, Elihas Starr (Michael Cerveris), had attempted an experiment to reach the Quantum Realm, but his own tunnel became unstable. His wife Catherine (Riann Steele) tried to escape with young Ava, but the little girl ran back for her father. The tunnel caused a huge explosion, killing Elihas and Catherine, but Ava survived and her molecules destabilized, resulting in her uncontrolled phasing. She and Bill now plan to use Janet\'s quantum energy to help turn Ava normal, even if it might kill Janet. Hank fakes having a heart attack to get Bill to grab a tin of Altoids for his meds, which really contain Hank\'s trained ants that grow to a large size and help free them, allowing the three to escape and take the lab back.After enlarging the lab, Janet takes control of Scott\'s mind, revealing to Hope and Hank a new algorithm that will help them stabilize the tunnel and enter the coordinates to locate her, but she warns them that they only have two hours before the Quantum Realm becomes so unstable they won\'t be able to reach her for another century.Burch and his goons go to X-Con and interrogate Luis, Dave, and Kurt using a truth serum (though the villains insist that\'s not what it is). Luis reveals that Scott is with Hope and Hank in the woods where they set up the lab. Ava appears after having heard this information, and she takes out the wheels on Burch\'s van as she heads to find the heroes herself. Burch then contacts the crooked FBI Agent Stoltz (Sean Kleier) and tells him where Scott will be. Stoltz tells Woo, and Luis quickly warns Scott so that he can return home before he is caught escaping his house arrest. Cassie is with him and says he could use a partner to help him, meaning herself, but Scott says he has Hope, which Cassie thinks is also a good fit.Hope and Hank are caught by FBI agents once they shrink the lab. Stoltz grabs it but he is knocked out by Ava, who then takes the lab herself. Scott uses the trained ants to help Hope and Hank break out of the FBI headquarters. The ants guide the three to the lab\'s location, and Luis joins them as backup. Hank uses the giant ants to get Bill out so that he can use his old suit to go into the Quantum Realm and find Janet. The lab is shrunken again, and Luis grabs it. Scott, as Ant-Man, is attacked by Ava, but he holds her off long enough for Hope and Luis to get away.Scott flies away on a flying ant to meet up with Hope and Luis at the rendezvous point, but they are followed by Burch and his men, as well as Ava. Hope shrinks and enlarges the van to literally throw the goons off, even enlarging a Hello Kitty Pez dispenser to throw at one of them. Scott grows to Giant Man to stop them, but as Ava intervenes, Hope becomes The Wasp to fight her. Burch takes the lab and runs to the docks where he boards a ship to get away. Scott grows again to reach him and stop him to recover the lab. Luis shows up in another car to meet with them, but Scott gets light-headed from being so huge that he falls into the water. Hope swims down to save him.In the Quantum Realm, Hank nearly loses his signal, but he finally manages to locate Janet at her coordinates, and they reunite with a kiss. Meanwhile, the lab has returned to its normal size, and Ava and Bill are planning to get Janet\'s quantum energy. Hank and Janet start to return as Ava and Bill begin the process, which starts to drain Janet. Scott and Hope show up and disable their machine, giving Hank and Janet enough time to come out of the Quantum Realm. Hope reunites with her mother at last. Janet then sees Ava\'s problem, and she puts her hands on Ava to stabilize her and stop her phasing. Everyone leaves as the heroes take the lab. Bill wants to keep protecting Ava, but she tells him they need to split up. Outside the lab, Dave and Kurt help Luis incapacitate Burch and his goons before injecting them with truth serum as the cops arrive, leading to their arrest. Burch and his goons admit to everything.Woo thinks he knows Scott is out on the streets as Ant-Man, but he goes to his home and finds Scott there. Scott\'s sentence is finally over, and he is a free man once more. The first thing he does is go see Cassie.In the final scene, Luis gets a new, wealthy client for his business to keep them from going under. Hank brings Janet to the beach where they set up a new house that he expands to it\'s original size. Scott shrinks himself, Hope, and Cassie in a car so they can use a laptop as a screen like a drive-in movie. They are then bothered by a large butterfly.Mid-Credits: Hank and Janet have set up the Quantum Tunnel in a van on a rooftop with Hope\'s help so that Scott can enter it. He obtains quantum energy to keep helping Ava be stabilized. Just as Scott is ready to go back, the others fail to bring him back, and he doesn\'t hear anyone on the other end of the radio. Back in the real world, Hank, Janet, and Hope have all been turned to ash by Thanos snapping his fingers (at the end of \'Avengers: Infinity War\'), leaving Scott forever trapped in the Quantum Realm with no chance of getting back to Earth.Post-Credits: Most of San Francisco appears to have felt the effects of the Gauntlet; more than half of all life in the city and on Earth and the entire universe is gone... except for the giant ant, who is still in Scott\'s apartment playing on his drum-set.The final text reads ""Ant-Man and the Wasp will return...?""']"

This ""movie"" has zero character building, zero real story and zero involvement - all you get here is just a colorful cartoon - you can\'t even say anything good about acting - it was wooden and dead on - it looked like no one had interesting in making it.Overall, if this ""movie"" wouldn\'t be a part of MCU, it would tank at box office.

Jackson swaggers with a coolness that has not aged one bit, with Jackson hitting Fury's comedic punch-lines with a smooth as silk ease. The first woman superhero in the Disney Marvel films to have her own solo movie, Brie Larson brings out the heroic in Marvel's passion to save the Skrulls, but fails to fly to a super height in the comedic,and establishment of her own origins,as Larson delivers punch lines with a stilted awkwardness which allows Jackson (who has worked with Larson three times) to outshine her in the jokes, and Larson also keeps a cold distance from giving Marvel the enthusiasm other superheros have when using their powers.Designed as a origin for Captain Marvel, the writers visibly show more interest in the side characters than they do in lead, with the plight of the Skrulls bringing a heart and urgency to the mission, which drifts away in the mid-section that focuses on Marvel's dry beginnings. Dipping into the Dr Strange-style fantastical with a striking sequence of Marvel fighting her inner turmoil, co-directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck are joined by cinematographer Ben Davis in largely skipping over the enticing fantastical (save for a cute cat) to deliver slick Marvel Comics action set-pieces and Star Wars-inspired space ship races, wrapped in a catchy 90's soundtrack leaving No Doubt on Captain Marvel's powers."", ""Brie Larson was miscasted for this role and/or was just phoning it in for this film.

Lacking any type of backstory makes this movie uninteresting. It's bad enough that the plot was lame, but on top of that the main character had no character. If they're going to make her super powerful, they should at least give details about getting her powers and what they are. It doesn't really do any of that.

But overall Captain Marvel deserves better, a lot better."", ""OK, I get it, it's just make believe sci-fi, but good sci-fi has some plausibility for the future. Negatives: 1. CGI average at best & a lot of it is just re-using already coded & stored effects from other movies. Why do the cities & spacecraft w/the same physically dumb swooshing sound found in similar movies look as if made-up by a college design major hyper on drugs. Reality plausibility - zero! 2. Dialogue is at a level you would use grocery shopping. Over-simplistic, not intelligent. Aliens have better English articulation & grammar than actual English have. As supposed baddies their dead Satan look is the look du jour in sci-fi. And, why do aliens always have the same body plan as us, i.e. two of every thing except nose, mouth (yes, I know, it's cheaper to clothe a stunt human). 3. Jump points that look borrowed from bee architects? I knew they were smart little critters, but that made no sense. Writers avoided the problem of unimaginable distances & time to travel as usual. 4. The unlimited smorgasbord of energy emanating from her body was laughably dumb, but entertaining. Usual white eyes which mean? Positives: 1.

Brei Larson is one of the worst addition to avengers world ."", 'I am a Marvel fan. I go see all the movies, then buy the blu-rays. I have character statues, posters and have read the comics including Captain Marvel. There is a reason people become fans of certain things, and those things done well over time generate more fans until it becomes a ""Juggernaut"" like the MCU has. I fear that it\'s not unstoppable however, as the sub-par Captain Marvel has painfully illustrated. The movie is a pastiche of poorly written scenes with a bit of uninspired action sprinkled here and there with barely any plot at all. Carol Danvers has no character development whatsoever, no adversity to overcome besides amnesia and no villain to fight. I know there are people saying they like this movie, but I feel like they either aren\'t being honest or they like it for personal reasons that are not present in the movie. Objectively speaking, in terms of the technical aspects of storytelling, Captain Marvel just isn\'t effective. Subjectively, I was bored the entire time and the nostalgia parts made me feel as though JJ Abrams was poking me in the ribs asking me if I \'member the 90\'s. Yes. Yes I do. And for the record, people are criticizing this movie because it was bad, not because they ""haaaate the wooomans!"" Dismissing legitimate criticisms using this tactic will not produce better films, which is the only thing most people want. The problem is that they built the movie around the idea of ""strong woman"" and promoted it as an identity film, so when the movie ends up being bad some people rush to defend it because they don\'t want the IDEA to fail. The movie itself is secondary - just a vehicle to slap their bumper stickers on, which is a real shame because this could have been a great addition to the MCU. I hope they learn something from this, but from what I\'ve heard it appears that Marvel actually plans to escalate the identity politics in the next phase which would be an absolute disaster for them. When pointing to the box office as a defense for how ""good"" Captain Marvel was, just remember that tons of paying customers didn\'t like it at all.', 'Marvel is a victim of its own success. They\'ve been so good for so long that perfection is expected with every release. Their brand name now rivals the likes of Apple, Nike, or Coke. Slapping ""Marvel"" on a movie means $100M or more. That\'s not to say that they don\'t have to try, it\'s just to say that they don\'t have to try as hard. So, I don\'t say that they didn\'t try with Captain Marvel, I just don\'t think they gave their best effort.With 19 years of Marvel movies it\'s hard to bring along a superhero that\'s going to wow people. Of course there are the Marvel faithfuls that would be pleased with anything that has Marvel\'s name on it but for those others--what\'s left? After a Spider-Man, the X-Men, Hulk, Thor, Iron Man, Captain America, Blade, Ant-Man, Black Panther, Deadpool, Guardians of the Galaxy, Doctor Strange, and a host of supporting characters even a Captain Marvel seems tame. And let\'s be honest, how many of us saw this movie because it\'s attached to The Avengers: End Game?If I broke down my reasons for seeing Captain Marvel I\'d say 50% because it\'s a Marvel movie, 40% because it\'s attached to The Avengers, and 10% because it\'s a superhero movie.At this point it\'s not simply about powers anymore. Sure, the superpowers are cool but they can only take a movie so far. The story needs to be good and the lead character needs to be even better. I found Brie Larson dull. Besides fitting the look needed she offered nothing. She failed to distinguish herself in a world of distinguished superheros.Marvel can easily absorb this loss and truthfully I\'m probably in the minority by calling this a loss. IMO Captain Marvel didn\'t thrive on its own--much like Hulk didn\'t thrive on its own--not a problem, lets see how she does working with a team.', ""Ok, so who was most power-full hero before Captain Marvel? Thor obviously! Hulk is strong, and maybe he did not unleash his full potential (he surely can be more angry), but Asgardian which is also God of Thunder, unleashed his full potential in Ragnarok and found his new weapon Stormbreaker, built from dying star. Like it's said in the Infinity War, this is by far strongest weapon, and we saw how powerful Thor is with Stormbreaker. He was even able to break blast from infinity gauntlet and seriously almost kill Thanos.And now, after Captain Marvel, Thor is not most power-full hero. Like we saw in the movie (and Kevin Feige confirmed), Carol Denvers is most powerfull character (CHARACTER, not hero) introduced in MCU.And how did she get those powers? Oh... well... she is human... and... she destroyed some ship's engine... and absorbed it's energy!Seriously? Ok, that engine was made from Tesseract. But seriously? That's enough to become stronger than Thor, Odin, Thanos, Hela or any other MCU character?Oh yes, and this movie has 0% character development of Carol Denvers and tons of plot holes, but it's fun, mostly because of Samuel Jackson and cat. I would give it 6-7 stars, as standalone movie, but it just has huge negative impact on MCU and all previous movies."", ""Nothing stirs your emotions in this film.

At no point was I remotely emotionally invested in her character. She's easily right up there with Kristen Stewart and Hayden Christiansen for utterly lacking in any ability to emote.If this is the character they're going to base he MCU around going forward, good luck to them."", 'God, I love Brie Larson. Loved her in Scott Pilgrim and absolutely agreed with her Oscar for Room. So what the bleep happened here?It is hard to think back to the many, MANY superheroes of the past couple of decades to find a superhero SO plain, SO boring, SO shallow, SO lifeless and without a bit of soul or personality as Brie Larson\'s Captain Marvel. I had to check to see if George Lucas directed this, because I definitely saw the female Anakin Skywalker here.She was so bad, or her character, at least, she took me completely out of the movie. I never once rooted for her, couldn\'t care less about her plight and frankly was just waiting for her to end up right where I knew she would thanks to the third Avengers movie. And that\'s sad, because the movie isn\'t necessarily a bad one...it\'s just the title character had none of that Marvel as suggested.Erasing the bore, I loved how the movie was shot. Set in the mid-90s, it, of course, had a kick-ass 90s soundtrack (all of my favorites!!) and the familiar technology and stores from back then. But, bypassing that, the movie FELT like it was shot, edited, paced and scripted like it was from the 1990s. I totally felt transported back to my favorite decade and I praise this movie for that.In a rather quick and easy to follow setup, we learn our title character wants to join an elite group of alien warriors hell-bent on stopping shapeshifters from destroying their protected worlds. Naturally, the one focused on in the movie is Earth and there, our ""hero"" has to track the shapeshifters with no other than Nick ""call him"" Fury.Sadly, the movie is predictable from minute one and this is not just because it ties into many other MCU films. Normally, that would bother me, but again, the filmmaking all felt really 90s to me, so I\'m pretty familiar with the old formulas.Only a select handful of jokes landed, mostly from Sam Jackson and the special effects were good, not great. Too many of the older actors looked fake as younger versions of themselves. Despite that, it was so nice seeing Annette Bening again. It\'s been far too long.I didn\'t hate the movie, but will only give it a VERY mild recommendation. If Captain Marvel/Brie Larson wasn\'t so incredibly and painfully dull, we would\'ve had a MUCH BETTER Marvel outing. It even ended somewhat solidly for her, but not enough to make up for the previous 2-hours of sleepwalking she did.***Final thoughts: Admirable on the opening Marvel Logo and the 1st post-credit scene: totally worth it, especially since it\'s only 1-2 minutes into the 20-minute end credits. You can absolutely skip the last post-credit scene and just Google it when you get home.', ""The acting and script are so cheesy it's kinda hard to watch. I wish they would have given the main role to someone else. There is no depth to Captain Marvel, she acts in the movie like she does in real life, a man-bashing wench. Shame on Marvel for putting this out as a finished movie."", ""I was so surprised that I'm seeing the worst Marvel movie ever!The director didn't design the plot to make our emotions go up and down as would any other great movie did. Instead, Captain Marvel became so much boring in the middle part. I mean the 1-hour middle part was just so boring that I almost fell asleep. The way he presented a combination of flash backs is just not coherent with the entire scene. They were NOT shown at the right moment and NOT at the right time. It somehow felt disconnected at times.The acting of the protagonist is also questionable. It's like she doesn't has a personality at all. It was either her BAD action or TERRIBLE script. It even got worst when it got near the end. Suddenly, the action just got so disconnected with the previous scenes. Out of nowhere, without any logical sense nor past-experience motivator nor emotional-related incident, Captain Marvel became the most powerful super hero that ever lived.Fire the director and the script writer!"", ""This movie portrays Captain Marvel as a girl. Captain Marvel was a muscle bound man. I'm not sure what kind of a statement they were trying to make with the release of this schlock, but all they succeeded in doing was turning me off.

Yon-Rogg, her mentor and commander, warns her to control her abilities while the Supreme Intelligence, an organic artificial intelligence who acts as the ruler of the Kree, urges her to keep her emotions in check.While working with official Ronan the Accuser to rescue an undercover spy, Vers is abducted and subjected to a memory probe by a group of Skrulls, alien shapeshifters with whom the Kree Empire is at war. Vers escapes and, after leaving the Skrulls\' ship in an escape pod, crash lands on Earth. Her presence attracts the attention of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents Nick Fury and Phil Coulson, whose investigation is interrupted by a Skrull attack. In the ensuing chase, Vers recovers a crystal containing her memories and Fury kills a Skrull impersonating Coulson. Fury later meets and agrees to work with Vers while Skrull commander Talos disguises himself as S.H.I.E.L.D. operative Keller.Using Fury\'s security clearance, Vers learns she was a pilot who is presumed to have died six years earlier while testing an experimental light-speed engine designed by scientist Wendy Lawson, who she recognizes as the woman from her nightmares. The two escape after ""Keller"" confronts them, with Lawson\'s cat Goose stowing away, and pilot a small cargo jet to Louisiana. A meeting with felllow pilot Maria Rambeau and her young daughter Monica reveals Vers\' real name is Carol Danvers.Talos, who had tracked her, arrives and asks to speak. Using the black-box recorder of Lawson\'s crashed plane, Danvers learns an alien spaceship had shot it down - and she now remembers Yon-Rogg killing Lawson, as well as Lawson\'s warning that the experimental engine\'s energy-core had to be destroyed to keep it from the wrong hands. Vers shot it and was caught in an ensuing explosion, with her body absorbing the energy. Yon-Rogg brought the amnesiac ""Vers"" - the remaining portion of ""Danvers"" on her broken dog tag - to Hala.Talos explains the Skrulls are simply refugees, and Lawson\'s engine was to help them escape beyond Kree reach. Using coordinates Lawson had given Danvers, she, along with Fury, Monica, and Goose - who for some reason terrifies Talos - fly their Skrull-modified cargo jet to a cloaked ship in orbit. There they find the source of the energy-core\'s power, the Tesseract - and some Skrull refugees, including Talos\' mate and child. Yon-Rogg\'s Starforce, having tracked them, captures Danvers and places her in VR before the Supreme Intelligence. Enraged at being used, Danvers fights back, and discovers that a Kree implant that purportedly gave her Kree powers was instead limiting them.Accessing her full force, Danvers escapes, gives the Tesseract to Fury for safekeeping, and battles the Starforce to give Rambeau time to fly herself, Fury, and the Skrulls to Earth - along with Goose, who is not a cat but an alien known as a Flerken that can sprout powerful tentacles and whose insides are a pocket dimension where the Tesseract is placed. Rambeau shoots down a pursuing Minn-Erva. Danvers chases an escaping Yon-Rogg and discovers the extent of her powers, including flight. She singlehandedly destroys multiple ballistic missiles that Ronan, called in by Yon-Rogg, has fired at Earth, and forces Ronan\'s forces to retreat. On Earth, Danvers quickly defeats Yon-Rogg and sends him back to Hala with a warning to the Supreme Intelligence.Danvers agrees to help the Skrulls find a new homeworld, giving Fury a modified pager with which to contact her in an emergency. Fury later drafts a proposal for an initiative, changing the name after finding a photo with Danvers\' old call sign of ""Avenger"".In a present-day mid-credits scene, Danvers meets Avengers Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, Bruce Banner, and James Rhodes, who were monitoring the pager Fury had activated.

48,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Avengers: Endgame,4154796,"[""So here we have it, AVENGERS: ENDGAME, the expansive sequel to not only AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR but also to the whole last 13 years or so of Marvel cinema. It's a film that had big boots to fill but the good news is that it's a complete success and every bit as enjoyable as its predecessor. At three hours I wasn't sure about the pacing, but even during the slower first half the viewer's interest remains piqued thanks to the witty dialogue and huge cast of well-established characters doing their thing.The time travel plot might seem a cop out to some, but I really enjoyed the way it gives characters a chance to revisit earlier productions (and even allow the likes of Robert Redford to show up in clever cameos). The climactic action is well worth the wait and bests the battles in LORD OF THE RINGS: RETURN OF THE KING in terms of pure CGI spectacle; it only took them 16 years to get it right. Great fun, anyway, and one for the ages."", 'Hawkeye loses his family with the snap. Tony Stark and Nebula are stranded in space. They are rescued by Captain Marvel. What remains of the Avengers set off to confront Thanos only to find that he had already destroyed the Stones. Five years later, Scott Lang escapes from the quantum realm. He is shocked by the new world order and comes up with an idea to save everyone, a Time Heist.This is the 22nd film in the MCU. The best aspect is that it pulls together the whole series of movies and fulfill many of their emotional storylines. Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Ant-Man, and Nebula all get some powerful personal stories. Thor is doing a funny ""The Dude"" Lebowski. Iron Man is his family. Captain America finally gets his love. Hawkeye becomes vengeance. There are some other aspects that I would alter with the Infinity Gauntlet.For Ant-Man, Paul Rudd\'s comedic takes diminishes his pain from losing Hope. He\'s not quite as broken as Hawkeye. His lost keeps conflicting with his humor. Black Widow\'s fight with Hawkeye lasts too long. Sometimes, less is more and doing fewer reversals would add power to each turn. Nebula\'s final confrontation with herself needs some better work. She needs to have a talk with herself or do an Indiana Jones and shot right away. She could give a punchline like ""I don\'t like how she looks"". The movie yadayada a lot about time travel. The only explanation is that it\'s not any of those movies. It\'s a funny line but it\'s basically saying that it has no rules. Then the characters say that there are rules. I don\'t begrudge the MCU for yadayadaing the rules because that could get real complicate. Finally, this MCU ends like many MCU movies, with a chaotic massive final battle. I\'d prefer cutting that back and the female Avengers assemble is a little too convenient. Just have two other women. That\'s enough. It becomes fan service. Overall, the emotional resolutions are great. The recalls to the other movies are satisfying. The story works for the most part. In a franchise that is sure to keep going to infinity, this is a great rest stop to say a few goodbyes.', '""Avengers: Endgame"" is a new American movie from 2019 and well do I really need to say a lot about the basics here? Maybe only a little bit as absolutely everybody should know by now who the Avengers are. I believe it is essential that you have seen the previous Avengers movie from 2018 in order to appreciate this one here. But you don\'t need to have seen everything before that from the Avengers universe by any means in order to understand this one here. Directors Russo and Russo are back and they also got their screen writers on board again here, but this is really not a surprise and accurate as this is basically a duology. Also despite the ending from the previous Avengers film, all the actors are back and with that I really do mean ""all"", even some that did not show up in the last Avengers movie, but in previous films from the universe. Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer would be the best example, even if all of these really only have very brief screen time. And what was with that Robert Redford inclusion? Now that did feel a bit bizarre.Anyway, in this 3-hour(!) film the remaining Avengers are faced with the big challenge to find a way to turn things right again and when the option of time travel arises, this seems to be their only chance. Sadly, Thanos, the titan and main antagonist, who managed to erase half the universe in the previous film, finds out about the remaining Avengers\' plans. It will be a tough battle. But one when there are new heroes on the horizon offering hope such as Captain Marvel Carol Danvers who just got her own movie not too long ago. That one featured a great deal of Samuel L. Jackson, who is almost unseen in this one here. But I mentioned Thanos already and would like to say a few more words about him now. I really loved him in the 2018 film, but in this one here, he was a bit underwhelming. I understand he is weakened because he destroyed the stones not too long ago and also does not really care too much because his mission is complete, but still the way we see him basically fight all Avengers at the very same time in the previous movie and here Captain Marvel alone can almost keep him under control at his neck. Or Thor out of nowhere severes his head. It just felt a bit too easy for me honestly. Now that I mentioned Thor here, he is in it pretty much for the comedy only this time as he has turned into quite a bum over the years when everybody is clueless how to bring the lost souls and friends back. And there are many other comedy-themed moments in here. You will laugh, but you will also be sad on some occasions. I will go into further detail about that statement in the next paragraph, so if you want to avoid in-depth spoilers, then now is the time to stop reading.I personally was more shocked by the death of Black Widow than by the death of Iron Man, perhaps because I have never been a huge RDJ fan in this franchise, even if I don\'t mind him either. And well, Scar-Jo plays in some films I quite adore, so it was sad to see her go, also because the build-up was very strong and you never knew if it was her or Jeremy Renner\'s character who would die. I like him too, so a loss-loss for me. Oh well I read Black Widow will get her own film soon, so I am curious how that turns out. 100% I\'m gonna watch it. And at the end, when we find out about Captain America\'s personal decision how to spend the rest of his life, it was a bit sad and touching too, even if I think I read that Evans is finished with the franchise after this film. We\'ll see how his replacement does. I have a bit of a feeling by now they are really trying too hard to get African American actors in here for the sake of it. But maybe he can prove me wrong and he is actually good. Another scene I did not like very much was the female-power-centered one when we see virtually all female characters line up all of a sudden. That did feel cringeworthy and just for the sake of pleasing liberal Hollywood. But yeah, there were many really good moments that quickly make me forget about these, so it is all good. There were great moments without a doubt and I think the Avengers universe keeps going in style. But you should not expect this film to be as good as the last. I think it stays lower quality-wise. Stan Lee\'s final brief cameo was also rather underwhelming. May he rest in peace.Okay finally, the closing credits were kinda special this time because we also see the protagonists in a unique way and do not get the usual epilogue scene with indications to the next movie, but it makes sense as of course there is definite closure in this movie here and the Russos most likely won\'t return or if they will, they have no ideas yet what will come up next. It must be special to top Thanos and these two films for sure though. But yeah, the universe is restored, half of the civilization erased is back and Thanos is defeated, so time to take a breath for a little while. And pay attention to how it is those who survived the cleansing (Black Widow, Iron Man and Captain America) who are eventually those who can be called fallen, well CA only to some extent. I think it is not necessary to give you a recommendation here as you probably know very well how much you like superhero films. The one thing I think is essential though is that you must absolutely watch the 2018 film before seeing this one and then you can decide for yourself if you want to sit through another 3 hours on the subject or accept evil being victorious. Make the right choice for yourself. I give Avengers: Endgame a thumbs-up, but not a too enthusiastic one as before.', ""The 22nd film in Marvel Cinema Universe has an end of term feel about it. This shows with the lack of post credit scenes.With the population of the universe halved, Thanos has completed his task.The remainder of Earth superheroes try to retrieve the Infinity Gauntlet but Thanos destroyed it.It is the appearance of Ant Man who escapes from the Quantum Realm and shows up on Earth after five years that leads to a plan and it involves a Time Heist.What is left of the team go back to different time zones and different parts of the universe to collect the infinity gems. This means re-enacting scenes from previous Marvel films such as Captain America 2: The Winter Soldier. It leads to a moment where Robert Downey Jr, Tom Hiddleston, Chris Hemsworth all vie to be in the same shot with a particular superstar actor who supposedly called time on his acting career last year.It is a big spectacle, there is a major battle that comes across as flat when it needed to be better choreographed. There are some emotional scenes with some characters among the fallen.However this is one long movie. It needed to cut at least 45 minutes from its running time. The time travel elements might make sense in comics but not here. At one point, I thought the Russo Brothers were going to outdo Peter Jackson by dragging the film's ending on and on."", 'Much like I did for Infinity War, I was caught up a little bit on the hype, but mostly I think I prioritized seeing this so that I could browse Reddit again, since so many popular posts are memes from the final two Avengers films. Unsurprisingly perhaps, I found that it was very much the overall picture I found with Infinity War, which is that it is far from perfect, a blockbuster pure and simple, but that it is quite a piece of work in terms of how well put together it all is.In terms of that structure, at time of writing this there are quite a few comments comparing it to the final season of Game of Thrones (which right now just has 2 episodes left) in the way that it has to bring everything together. The comparison is unfavorable, partly because GoT continues it very rushed approach to writing, but mainly because Endgame does it very well. The detail of the plotting is of course filled with holes that are best just to ignore, but the structure allows for a very nice conclusion as we retouch on moments from within the existing films, allowing nostalgia, references, and a sense of winding it up (although of course it will continue as long as the films make money). As with Infinity War, the writing somehow gives characters enough time despite there being so many of them; it hits several tones but none undercuts or takes away from another; and it mixes humor and action into a plot that takes itself seriously enough so it feels like it has weight.Of course it is still a blockbuster film, and far from perfect, but it is impressively done and very easy to enjoy if you go with what it is doing.', 'Minor spoilers.This is not the film I expected after the last Captain Marvel (Brie Larson). If you missed ""Ant-man and the Wasp"" that has an important tie-in. Brie Larson was in the film far less than expected. When you have so many Avengers on the screen at one time, it is hard for anyone to get a major part.After they did the Blues Brothers, we are getting the band back routine, they did a very awkward ""Back to the Future"" movie that did not work as well as planned. I expected Nebula would trick Thanos and get some stones followed by the mother of all battles led by Captain Marvel. They didn\'t make that film.The production had some good laugh lines and some hold back the tears moments. Not to give away too much, but it was rumored some stars didn\'t want to do the series anymore. They were given a Captain Kirk exit.And yes, there is, of course, the mother of all Avenger\'s battle which will be hard to top.Stan Lee as a driver.', 'I usually do not watch movies twice in such a short amount of time. But after I did the Double Feature (at the Midnight premiere) with Infinity War almost 2 weeks ago, I re-watched Endgame yesterday and it was as amazing as my first impression of it was! And while I will not spoil anything about Endgame, I will talk about things Infinity War! So if you have not seen that yet, do not blame me for anything revealed here.My summary is a pop culture reference and there are quite a few in the Marvel movies, hinting at other franchises (Alien got name checked for example in Infinity War and even ""copied"" or ""homaged"" if you will and there are a few in Endgame too). But those little digs are not too important, they are just nice touches for those who know them. Having an understanding of the MCU as a whole, from Phase 1 to now Phase 3 is way more important. And as someone who is not too familiar with the comics myself, I can tell you that knowing the movies is enough to enjoy the franchise.Still you can google the other stuff or even make your own conclusions. Now that is a lot of foreword and I haven\'t even gotten one word about Endgame. But as I said above, no spoilers here. What we do know (from the trailers) is the beginning. But whatever we saw and thought we knew - what happens not even half an hour into the movie, will rattle you. Now what?Yes the first hour of the movie is ""slow"", but it had to be. There are ramifications after the snap and the characters we learned to love, that we have close to our heart, have been torn apart. Quite literally gone with the wind - everyone is thinking how is this going to be resolved (no pun intended)? And the movie will give you answers, and will even try to sort of explain things that are quite - unexplainable.And while there is full on drama, there is still a lot of humor. The movie takes beloved characters and does things to them - or rather the weight of what happened does things to them. What exactly? Well that would be telling, but let me tell you some very bold choices have been made. And if you are not emotional at least during some scenes, you are taking away a lot of fun for yourself.I can be a cynic too at times, but taking this apart (which you can do with every movie), is only hurting your own viewing pleasure. There is so much love in this, for the characters, for details, for the fans - it\'s just a rollercoaster and I\'m not afraid to say that I shed a couple of tears. It is after all tying knots and bringing certain things to a conclusion.That doesn\'t mean there isn\'t anything more coming (because we know there is, next up Spiderman as an in between movie before Infinity War?). And there are some familiar faces coming back to Endgame from other movies that we haven\'t seen in a while but also new cameos like Ken Jeong. I\'m guessing there will be a deleted scene with him, his scene seems to short for storytelling purposes I reckon.Epic fights, epic emotions and dialog that is hinting at things to come later in the movie ... which you will see even clearer with repeat viewing(s) ... The Russos did it - Kudos to them, Kevin Feige, Stan Lee (RIP) and everyone else involved in this of courseEdit: Endgame works even for people who have not seen a single MCU movie yet (confirmed by a friend of mine). But of course the gravitas and the conclusions of everything will work way better if you have seen the rest of the movies. Also let me add that this is ""technically sound"" as some would put it - or just plain great visually speaking. But I reckon this is a given anyway. Popcorn (or Nachos or whatever you prefer) to perfection', 'Given the hype and the huge buildup to the opening of this movie, I wouldn\'t have expected any less of a reaction than what I find on these review boards. And to be fair, the film does encompass and bring to a finale a massive story line with a virtually complete cast of characters that form the Marvel Comics Universe. However a little bit of objectivity is in order, and the movie\'s current standing after three days of release (as I write this) is just a bit hard to fathom. At number five on IMDb\'s list of Top Rated Movies, I can only shake my head. Think of your absolutely favorite movie of all time, (unless this one is it), and ""Avengers: Endgame"" has just surpassed it. This is a pet peeve of mine and I\'ve written about it before in my reviews, so I don\'t want to get carried away here. Suffice it to say that for me, any brand new release to achieve such a ranking isn\'t really a reflection to how good it is, but a response by the majority of fans who come to these pages to give it a top rating.So rather than being a complete killjoy, I thought the movie was good for what it was, but it took quite a stretch to bring back the characters who went missing following Infinity War. The plot utilizes the time worn (no pun intended), time travel gimmick to hurl the principal heroes back to three (or four) different pasts in order to undo the havoc created by Thanos (Josh Brolin) and his destructive use of the Infinity Stones. For once, one of the characters, can\'t remember who it was, stated that going into the past is really creating a new future, so that the present reality eventually becomes the past. I liked that because if you think it through, that\'s exactly correct. But in so doing, a whole lot gets muddled as the story progresses, and the idea that Thanos \'used the stones to destroy the stones\' makes everything that follows feel like the writers making it up as they went along. Which of course, is what they did, but you know what I mean.There are a lot of huh? moments in the picture - fat Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is one - why? Thor cutting off Thanos\'s head another - too easy, why not any time prior? Stuff like that demeans credibility and took me out of the picture for a moment. Captain America (Chris Evans) battling himself? Doctor Strange\'s (Benedict Cumberbatch) circular reasoning - ""If I tell you what happens, it won\'t happen"". Enough stuff like this makes it all a bit muddled to follow, especially when things reach a fever pitch and the last hour descends into a gigantic free for all.But there were interesting elements in the picture. I liked what the writers did with the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), even if he didn\'t go into \'Smash\' mode much. The fully functioning time/space GPS conjured up by Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) was kind of nifty, Elon Musk will probably start working on that any day now. I take with a few grains of salt that Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) died at the end, because, you know, no one dies in the comic book world and lives to tell about it. See, I could be a film writer too. Best of all, I\'m glad the film makers got a chance to insert Stan Lee into that 1970 time line scene, because he\'s my favorite Marvel character, and even though he\'s not around any more, he\'ll live on as a result of all his story writing and Marvel movie appearances.In summation, by all means, see the movie, but keep things in perspective. I may see things differently after watching it a second or third time, but right now, my initial reaction is tempered with some reservation. It didn\'t help that there was no after credits scene, but I guess that was the point. What comes next is anybody\'s guess.', ""So, it all came to this, the Marvel Cinematic Universe is the most financially and commercially successful superhero franchise for the last 12 years, and this was the conclusion to the Avengers storyline, the most anticipated, and highest-grossing movie of 2019 (it made $2 billion in 11 days, faster than Avatar, and surpassed the record of Titanic), it's the highest-grossing superhero movie of all time, directed by the Russo brothers (Welcome to Collinwood, You, Me and Dupree, Captain America: The Winter Soldier & Civil War). Basically half of all life on Earth was disintegrated by Thanos (Josh Brolin) and the Infinity Gauntlet. Carol Danvers aka Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) rescues Tony Stark aka Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) and Nebula (Karen Gillan), who were stranded in space following their defeat by Thanos on Titan. They reunite with the remaining Avengers: Bruce Banner aka Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Steve Rogers aka Captain America (Chris Evans), Rocket (Bradley Cooper), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and James Rhodes aka War Machine (Don Cheadle). They plan to retake the Infinity Stones and reverse the disintegrations, they locate and confront Thanos, but find that he has destroyed the Stones, in anger Thor kills Thanos. Five years later, Scott Lang aka Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) is returned (by chance) from the quantum realm to find the world devastated and half of the population disappeared in a snap. Scott finds Hope van Dyne aka The Wasp (Evangeline Lilly) and her father Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) have vanished but finds his daughter Cassie (Emma Fuhrmann) is now a teenager. Meanwhile, Rogers is attending grief counselling sessions for survivors still struggling following the wipe out, while Romanoff is at the Avengers' compound tirelessly keeping watch over both Earth and the rest of the universe with the help of Rhodes, Danvers, Okoye (Danai Gurira), Rocket, and Nebula. Lang returns to the compound; he explains that five years had only five hours for him in the quantum realm and theorises that it may be possible to build a time machine to reverse the annihilation. Stark refuses to help out of fear that he will lose his daughter Morgan (Lexi Rabe), who was born after the disintegration, but he talks with his wife Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), and does his own experiments. Banner has embraced the Hulk part of him, and melded himself and Hulk together as one, he agrees that it is possible to go back in time and steal the Infinity Stones before Thanos is able to collect them. Banner and Rocket travel to the small town of New Asgard, where Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) and the last survivors of Asgard have settled, they are shocked to Thor overwhelmed by guilt, with overgrown hair and overweight, eating junk, drinking, and playing video games with his friends Korg (Taika Waititi) and Miek, but they eventually convince him to return. Romanoff recruits Clint Barton aka Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), now a ruthless vigilante after his family was disintegrated. Initial experiments with the time machine with Lang go awry, but Stark arrives to shows them his findings to perfect it, and testing it with Barton, it is confirmed that it works. The Avengers plan which places in time to travel to where the five Infinity Stones are located. Banner, Lang, Rogers, and Stark travel to the battle of New York City in 2012 (Avengers Assemble) to retrieve the Time, Mind, and Space Stones. Banner visits the Sanctum Sanctorum and convinces the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton) to give him the Time Stone. Rogers successfully retrieves the Mind Stone, after battling with himself. Stark and Lang's interference inadvertently allows Loki (Tom Hiddleston) to escape with the Space Stone. But Stark remembers the Space Stone being in S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters in 1970, he and Rogers travel back to retrieve it, Rogers sights Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), and Stark has a meaningful conversation with his father Howard (John Slattery). Rocket and Thor travel to Asgard in 2013 (Thor: The Dark World) to extract the Reality Stone from Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), while there Thor has a conversation with his mother Frigga (Rene Russo), as it is the day she will be killed, which he cannot reverse, and he retrieves his hammer Mjolnir. Nebula and Rhodes travel to Morag in 2014 (Guardians of the Galaxy) and steal the Power Stone before Peter Quill aka Star-Lord (Chris Pratt) can. Rhodes returns to the present with the Power Stone, but Nebula is unable to return, her cybernetic interface has connected with that of her past self. Through this connection, the past version of Thanos learns of his future success and the plan of the Avengers to undo it. Thanos captures Nebula and sends past Nebula to the present day disguised as her future self. Barton and Romanoff travel to Vormir in the same year and learn that the Soul Stone requires the death of a loved one, they argue which of them should sacrifice themselves, but ultimately Romanoff falls to her death, allowing Barton to obtain the Soul Stone. Reuniting in the present, the Avengers fit the five Stones into a Stark-created gauntlet. Banner volunteers himself to wield the gauntlet, reasoning that he can withstand the radiation poisoning and the immense pain brought on by using the Stones. The snap of Banner's fingers is successful, all those disintegrated are resurrected, and one of the two of the group reunite with loved ones. However, past Nebula uses the time machine to transport past Thanos and his warship to the present, he attacks the Avengers compound. Nebula convinces past Gamora (Zoe Saldana) to turn against Thanos, and kills her past self, while Stark, Rogers and Thor battle Thanos. Doctor Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) arrives with other sorcerers, the Avengers: T'Challa aka Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), Peter Parker aka Spider-Man (Tom Holland), Wanda Maximoff aka Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Sam Wilson aka Falcon (Anthony Mackie), the Guardians of the Galaxy: Drax (Dave Bautista) and Groot (Vin Diesel), and the armies of Wakanda, Asgard, and the Ravagers. The fight between good and evil begins, Danvers arrives and destroys Thanos' warship, and Thanos seizes the gauntlet, but Stark maneuvers the Infinity Stones from his hand to his own, clicks his fingers, turning Thanos and his entire army into dust. Parker and Potts console Stark as he dies from radioactive overexposure to the Stones. A funeral is held for Stark, with all the Avengers, including leader Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), the Guardians of the Galaxy, Wakandans, Asgardians, and all other associated characters, attending. Barton and Wanda take solace in the fact that Romanoff and Vision did not return in the snap. Thor makes Valkyrie the Queen of Asgard, he joins the Guardians of the Galaxy to find his true purpose, free of the burden of royalty and leadership. Barton returns home to his family and Parker returns to school, where he is reunited with his best friend Ned (Jacob Batalon). Meanwhile, Rogers is tasked to go into the past to return the Infinity Stones and Thor's hammer to their original time lines, but after doing so, he chose to remain in the past to live a full life. Rogers appears before Wilson and his friend Bucky Barnes aka Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) as an old man, he passes his shield and the mantle of Captain America on to Wilson, and a flashback reveals that he finally found happiness with Peggy Carter. By the way, there is no post-credits sequence, only some sound effects. Also starring Benedict Wong as Wong, Pom Klementieff as Mantis, Letitia Wright as Shuri, Jon Favreau as Happy Hogan, Marisa Tomei as Aunt May, Angela Bassett as Ramonda, Michelle Pfeiffer as Janet Van Dyne, William Hurt as Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross, Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill, Winston Duke as M'Baku, Linda Cardellini as Laura Barton, Maximiliano Hernández as Agent Sitwell, Frank Grillo as Brock Rumlow, Ring's Hiroyuki Sanada as Akihiko, Tom Vaughan-Lawlor as Ebony Maw, James D'Arcy as Jarvis, Robert Redford as Alexander Pierce, Ross Marquand as Red Skull (Stonekeeper) and a posthumous cameo by Stan Lee as a 1970s Driver. You will almost not notice or care about the three hour running time, it is a story in three acts: the devastation of the world, time travelling to reverse it all, and the battle to save the world, the cast playing the superheroes and the villains are all great, it is the characters that really add to it all, it has good humour, it has amazing special effects, fight sequences and spectacle, and it gets you emotionally as well, a fantastic and fitting conclusion to the saga, a brilliant fantasy action adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects. Very good!"", 'Well, I finally got around to watching ""Avengers: Endgame"", even though I already watched ""Spider-Man: Far from Home"", so I already knew some of the events that were to transpire in ""Avengers: Endgame"". And I am not really fond of the superhero genre, but I still watch the movies when given the chance, as they are usually visually fantastic and provide adequate entertainment. And of course with all the hype that ""Avengers: Endgame"" had gotten, of course I just had to sit down and watch it.First of all, the movie was long. A little bit too long actually. I did feel that directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo were taking their sweet time getting to the core of the storyline, and just dancing around the bushes. In my opinion, the movie did suffer from this.Visually, well let\'s just go with \'wow\'. Yeah, the movie was phenomenally stunning to look at visually given the CGI and special effects. But of course, being a Marvel movie, then you\'d have top of the line special effects. And it is the visuals that carry the superhero movies quite a long way down the road.Story-wise, then I felt that the plot and storyline portrayed in ""Avengers: Endgame"" was a little bit too predictable and too generic. You already knew the movie\'s outcome when you sat down to watch it. Of course, Marvel weren\'t going to kill off a heap of their most beloved characters. No chance of that happening. So there weren\'t really much of any surprises along the way. And the time traveling aspect of the movie? Seriously? That was just downright idiotic.What worked for the movie, aside from the great visuals, was the impressive ensemble of actors and actresses that made an appearance in bigger or smaller parts throughout the course of the movie. Thumbs up for that. However, I found some of the dialogue to be a bit too corny and felt that it was written for a young audience.Was ""Avengers: Endgame"" a fulfilling closure to the Marvel storyline? Hardly so. The movie, while being entertaining enough, felt a bit shallow, with parts of the story quite poorly written. But if you, like me, come to the superhero movies mostly for the special effects, then ""Avengers: Endgame"" will definitely blow you away.All in all, I am rating ""Avengers: Endgame"" a six out of ten stars.', ""After 'the vanishing' in Infinity War, there were still a handful of superheroes left knocking about to try and restore order to the universe, but in Endgame the real hero is a rat. A lowly rodent scampers across the controls of Hank Pym's quantum machine, activating a few switches with his little ratty feet, bringing Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) back from his five-year stay in the quantum realm. And it is Lang's return that kick-starts a desperate attempt to reverse Thanos' nefarious handiwork.If you can swallow such lazy writing, then you'll no doubt have no problem with the rest of the film, which resorts to that old chestnut - time travel - with all the paradoxical problems that arise as a result. Unfortunately, I struggle to let such things slide, annoyed by rather casual approach taken by writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, whose script scampers lightly over the temporal issues like a rat over a console (I'm sorry, I just can't let that go). While the film is undeniably enjoyable as a slam bang piece of mega-budget entertainment, it isn't as flawless or as clever a denouement that one might hope for.Visually, Endgame is hard to beat and it's great to see all of the A-list stars of the past MCU movies coming together for one last effects-filled battle (it's amazing what $400,000,000 can buy), but for the culmination of a twenty-two film series, I had dearly hoped for something a bit more considered and fulfilling than a great-looking movie that is ultimately dependent on the actions of a rat (yes, it irritated me THAT much...)."", 'I haven\'t heard more people upset about spoilers since the Star Wars prequels, so please consider this sentence the spoiler space you very well may need if you don\'t want to learn more. Then again, I\'m going to discuss the idea of this film more than the actual movie itself.Avengers: Endgame is the blockbuster of 2019. It\'s a juggernaut that has the biggest cast of any superhero film ever, wrapping up almost 12 years of storyline and multiple movies, all to answer the question that came up at the end of Avengers: Infinity War: after you kill half of everything, what happens next?There\'s been a lot of soapboxing and online hand wringing about this film. Plenty of people feel the need to show that they\'re above the paltry populace, happy to proclaim their intellectual superiority and state that comic book related films demand that adults remain stuck in the days of adolescence. Much like the issues of today\'s politics, I\'m not going to change anyone\'s mind that feels that way. All that ends up is two people shouting their talking points and refusing to learn anything from one another. But my snide comment is this: can\'t you just leave well enough alone?This is a popcorn movie that appeals to the biggest audience ever. And that\'s fine. You can ignore it if you like - we\'ve never lived in a time where there\'s more opportunity to enjoy the media that you want. Me, I ignore mumblecore, critic beloved films and Oscar-bait movies for the most part. And that is also fine.All that I know is that I\'ve seen nearly every Marvel film with the same set of guys that I\'ve seen movies with since I was 25 or so. Each movie is an event where we get the chance to grab a meal, catch up and enjoy one another\'s company in the midst of our exceedingly stressful and busy lives. If a movie can do that, it\'s already a success before you even watch one frame. Movies bring us together, a light on the cave wall where we can hear a fantastic tale that\'s bigger than us. That\'s what this movie is - modern mythology of larger than life heroes who are the best of all of us battling the worst villains possible.Spoiler warning part two - here\'s where I get into major plot points. You\'ve been warned.More than the overall tale, I enjoyed the story beats here. Hawkeye becoming Ronin, enraged that evil survived the purge while his family did not. The main sacrifice of this film isn\'t Black Widow\'s, but his. He was the first person who saw her as more than a killing machine and gave her a chance at life. Now, she repays the favor, taking him from killing machine back to family man. However, he must sacrifice their friendship and the knowledge that her loss will always be in the background when measured against the perceived greater loss of Iron Man.But hey - I\'ve always loved the background characters more than the heavy hitters.There are moments here that really portray what the three main Avengers have had to give up to protect us. Iron Man must lose the stability and family he never knew he needed. Captain America\'s longing for Agent Carter, trapped by a glass wall that may as well be decades and not inches thick. Thor\'s descent into depression as he realizes that he couldn\'t save the day. Their fates each show them finally achieving the final part of their hero\'s journey save Thor, who is fated to repeat his journey over and over throughout rebirth after rebirth, even after Ragnarok, the end of all things.Those small moments mean more than the big explosions and special effects throughout this film. Tony\'s quick hug with his unsuspecting father. Thor\'s moment with his mother, who sees right through his deceptions. Even Quill\'s way too brief reunion with Gamora. The heart behind each charcter is why we care. There are hundreds of superpowered characters on the screen. The fact that we know the minute motivations of more than one of them is a credit to this tale.I love that this film both wraps up and begins new stories at its close. Sam Wilson must become Captain America, finally receiving the approval and friendship of the Winter Soldier. Thor realizes that his role is to be an adventurer, not the king, and gives the ownership of Asgard to Valkyrie. Even Steve Rogers realizes that despite becoming a grief counselor and telling people to live the new life they\'ve been given, when the opportunity arises to return to his life, it\'s one he should embrace.Speaking of Rogers, I haven\'t heard an audience start cheering in the theater for a long time. The fact that he\'s able to lift Mjolnir, Thor\'s hammer, was not lost on this audience. Before, he was able to budge it. Now, his journey has made him truly worthy to lead the forces against Thanos, even if he appears alone at the seeming conclusion of the final battle.I also like the synchronicity that the first words that kicked off the Marvel cinematic universe were Tony Stark saying, ""I am Iron Man,"" which are also his last words. There\'s just something poetic about that.Hey look - I was happy that Crossbones got a few seconds of screentime. I\'m that kind of geek. And if that fact upsets you, I\'m never going to convince you that this is a good movie.', 'My wife and I watched this movie at home on DVD from our public library, about 11 months after we similarly watched ""Infinity War"" where Thanos wanted to destroy half the universe.In fact the very first scene of this one depicts people, parts of families, just disappearing. Thanos is so powerful, and possessing all the infinity stones, would take a giant coordinated effort by all the Avengers to figure out a way to defeat him. And only some kind of time travel to secure each infinity stone would enable them to accomplish what is needed.The movie is long, very long, at just over 3 hours with the credits. We just can\'t watch a 3-hour movie in one sitting after steak and wine so we watched it over two consecutive nights.It is a good movie, characterizations are very good, as is the inventiveness of the story line. The least interesting to me were the CGI-full epic, frantic battles. They just became audio and video ""noise"" to me. But the hand-to-hand fighting was much better, as were the actual interactions of various characters.I don\'t see a listing for the next Avengers movie so is this the last one?', 'Watching the coming attractions was depressing. No wonder kids are half brain-dead today. My only interest in anything Avengers is Benedict Cumberbatch. I thought this was a fun film, loved all the cameos and the actors are all very likable. Special effects were amazing, but for about a half hour there I felt like I was watching a video game.Thought the script managed to have some poignancy and humor as well. And you have to see it in a theater.', 'If you\'ve watched a lot of these Marvel Cinematic Universe movies-as I have-than you probably laughed, was thrilled, and was ultimately touched by this-the pretty much final chapter of this run of the series which began with Iron Man back in \'08. The fate of him as well as Captain America and a few others were great epilogues for them. Oh, and one final cameo by Marvel Comics\' late creator of many of the company\'s popular superheroes-Stan Lee-makes it even more poignant. So to quote him, ""Excelsior!""', ""I've been looking forward to this for so long, and it surpassed all my expectations. It is a thrilling ride, an emotional journey, and has comedic moments as well. It even causes tears to fall. I can't wait to watch it again."", 'I like the bit where the back of his hand lights up different colours', ""OK So 3-Hours is Not Little Time for a Movie.But with a Universe so Vast and Varied with Characters and More Characters Interacting and Interweaving among Various Plot-Lines and Adventures,3-Hours can Barely Contain Any Kind of Finality that is Completely Satisfying.But the MCU (Marvel Comics Universe) has been Leading Audiences to this Point Through Over 20 Movies.So it had to Wrap-Up at some Point.

The Avengers: Endgame has been one of the most anticipated movies since... well since The Force Awakens but that was way back in 2015 and in this day and age that's like a million years ago. The point being: Endgame was the talk of the town since all of those beloved MCU characters faded away. Infinity War was such an epic movie what could Marvel do as an encore? Or better still, what could Marvel do to conclude the magnificent journey they took us on?If anything, Endgame proves that it's hard to write a perfect ending. Perfect endings are stuff of legend. Whether the ending has a twist, a ride off into the sunset, or a mixed bag they are hard to write and hard to execute. Endgame is supposed to be just as the title suggests: the end. This is where the Avengers wrap it all up. Endgame was one long goodbye and it seems they tried to make it as heartfelt and dramatic as possible.Infinity War started with a bang and ended with a bang. It was a fast moving roller coaster throughout. It came together so nicely with all the different characters, the different tasks, and the different battles. It was a superb blend of flavors that came together for an excellent meal. Endgame, on the other hand, was almost like a decompression. If you were huffing and puffing from Infinity War then Endgame was a chance for you to rest, catch your breath, and absorb all of what happened. It was a long slow exhale with just one last burst of energy before retiring. And it wasn't what I was expecting.Not that getting what one expects is necessary to be considered good because sometimes you can be surprised in the best way. After all, we've trusted Marvel thus far so no reason not to trust them to put the finishing touches on their masterpiece. Now that I've seen their final brush strokes and the completed work I have to say that their hand slipped a little when adding the finishing touches.Like a fireworks show or a symphony I wanted the ending to be this huge crescendo. I'm not talking simply about the last 20-30 minutes of the movie, but the entire movie. I wanted to see all of the fine Marvel characters in their finest form, or close to it, as they went for their last hurrah. I wanted them all to be like John Elway retiring after his second Super Bowl, retiring on top, not Muhammad Ali who held on too long and had a less than flattering exit from boxing. But that's not what I got.We got to see heroics, of course it's a superhero film, but it was so subdued. The entire tone of the movie was muted. It was a somber morose three hours. The humor wasn't as humorous. The fighting was somehow less awesome. Everything was just darker and more lifeless. Even the hero moments which were supposed to evoke the most joy, awe, and righteous triumph didn't quite do it. Now it could be because it was 12 a.m. by the time the movie wrapped up and I was tired but I don't think that was it. Many a movie has revived me due to it's captivation. End Game didn't revive me or stir me in the way I thought it should. If anything, they put me to rest along with the Avengers saga. I was going for a conclusion, yes, but I also wanted reinvigoration and revival. Sadly, I got solemn and subdue"", '. . . (that is, CNN and MSNBC) have labeled our current threat to Life the USA as we\'ve known it as Washington: Endgame, in apparent homage to AVENGERS: ENDGAME. Where these courageous news outlets may differ amongst themselves is in regard to which facets of the Armageddon-like Final Battle of the movie represent who, among the Axis of Evil\'s Real Life gathering of Satanic Forces. While ""R. Maddow"" on MSNBC has not been shy about pointing out that the cinema Bad Guy\'s Giant Flying Slug is a dead ringer for POTUS #45, CNN\'s ""A. Cooper"" seems equally convinced that this flick\'s ""Thanos"" is met to represent ""The Teflon Don."" Today, in THIS Reality, as ""Little Rocket Man"" is initiating the World\'s Nuclear Meltdown, as Iran verges on erasing Israel, as the USA\'s cold Trade War with Red Commie China is a nuclear football away from turning Red Hot, and as ""Mad Vlad"" Putin\'s henchman (aka, the White House Pawn, aka the KGB Puppet) declares himself ""President for Life,"" does it really matter whether Rachel or Anderson is the most correct?', 'This is made by people who do, for people who do, and this movie itself, does, love the MCU. You can think of it as a TV show finale. After 21 episodes that are all feature length. And before you can even say ""oh no those are all terrible"", this immediately proves itself to be an exception to that rule. Where the equally masterful Infinity War was almost one long action climax, this is less about fights. Which doesn\'t mean it doesn\'t have any. Or that they\'re anything less than excellent. And this film is definitely never boring. This focuses on character exploration. Every member of the original Avengers team, and a handful individuals that aren\'t, all get significant depth. I remain one of the few people who argue that Age of Ultron did deliver that, albeit in small concentrated format. This easily tops that. Everyone is pushed into a situation new to them. The trailers hint at some of these, whilst leaving others as incredible surprises. Make sure you avoid spoilers before watching this.This picture moves fast and packs a lot into its not quite lean running time. In other words, it\'s directed by the Russo Brothers. The length is justified. I wouldn\'t cut anything from this. The emotional moments don\'t feel sappy. The countless callbacks and references don\'t feel like they\'re just there to make you feel good for paying attention to all that lead to this one. The acting shows just how well all of these performers understand the characters. And the screenplay does the same for the writers. The effects are astonishing, yet again getting us to care about individuals that we know are all CG. It uses the varied skills, equipment and the like, of the unique heroes and villains, creatively. This delivers deeply satisfying closure. It truly is a conclusion. It\'s not trying to get you back to the theatre for the next adventure. The few currently confirmed entries into this franchise don\'t need hyping, anyway. Spider-Man with Mysterio? Another Black Panther story? The unfairly fired James Gunn returning to round out the trilogy of the Guardians of the Galaxy? Solo Black widow, *finally*? More Dr Strange? Shang-Chi, The Eternals, Blade? Keep \'em coming.I recommend this to everyone who\'s taken this entire journey. And if you\'re someone who\'s skipped some, or held off on this series up to this point, this is an excellent reason to address that. Unless they\'re simply not to your liking.

Fittingly uncompromising final chapter."", 'Greetings again from the darkness. In what was originally titled ""Avengers: Infinity War Part 2"", we get the much-anticipated conclusion to the most recent 22 Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films ... specifically Phase 3. Regardless if you are a deep-rooted fanboy or a casual viewer, you likely know the questions heading into this finale:Can the Avengers defeat Thanos? What role will Captain Marvel (and her pixie haircut) play? Will those who died in AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR be brought back to life? Will Tony Stark/Iron Man make it back from drifting in space? Who will survive this final battle?We knew this one had to be big, and in fact, it\'s colossal/humongous/monumental ... whatever your preferred adjective might be. And you can rest easy knowing that all of the above questions are answered quite clearly in this 3 hour epic from co-director brothers Anthony Russo and Joe Russo and co-writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (the same directors and writers behind AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR and a few other MCU entries).Marvel has excelled over the past decade plus by combining interesting characters, understandable story lines, visually stunning effects, and clever humor. This finale offers all of that and more. In fact, it\'s difficult to imagine a more perfect ending to this galactic odyssey ... and I don\'t offer that praise lightly. From the use of Traffic\'s classic ""Dear Mr. Fantasy"" and a gut-wrenching opening scene that yanks us right back into that feeling of dread provided by \'Infinity War\', we know we are in for a ride that is quite a bit more somber and even more emotional than what we\'ve come to expect.The fallout from the Thanos snap is clear as we catch up with Black Widow, Captain America, Thor and Hulk. Each is dealing on their own terms, and while the Banner-Hulk merger is quite something to behold, trust me when I say, you\'ve never imagined seeing Thor in his current state. This marks Chris Evans\' 10th film as Captain America, and he is front and center through much of the film - as is, in a bit of a surprise, Karen Gillan as Nebula. It makes sense given her tie to Thanos, and Ms. Gillan holds up quite well in the spotlight.Since the previous and speculation has been on time travel and the Quantum Realm, brace yourself for a bit of convoluted talk about how that works, but that\'s the closest thing to a negative I have to offer - and even that is offset by numerous punchlines at the expense of BACK TO THE FUTURE and most every other time travel movie ever made.The theatre was packed with Dallas area critics and industry folks, and there was a significant amount of cheering, applauding and more than a few sniffles. Yes, this one will take you on an emotional journey as well as a visual one. It has a tough/emotional beginning and a tough/emotional ending. These are characters we\'ve gotten to know over multiple films ... and you should know just about every major or mid-major character from every Marvel film makes an appearance, as do numerous minor ones. It\'s quite a remarkable reunion. And yes, the brilliance of Tilda Swinton as The Ancient One more than offsets the Pepper Potts scenes.Creator Stan Lee does get his final posthumous cameo (good for more applause), and there is a \'women\'s movement\' moment that seems to be Marvel\'s ""we hear you"" statement. Much of what we see is ""inevitable"", but as the Avengers assemble this last time, we are there to laugh, cry and gasp. This is what happens when \'over-the-top\' is \'just right\'.', 'How are the surviving Avengers & Co. possibly going to save half of the Universe that died? My wife & I had this discussion before viewing. It basically comes down to two options (assuming the events in ""Infinity War"" weren\'t just a dream): magic or time travel. All I\'ll say is: What they came up with was in ways reminiscent of the plot convolutions of ""Back to the Future II"" (1989).""Endgame"" (2019) begins strong with the devastating reality of half of all living beings in the Universe suddenly vanishing. It starts to get lethargic about an hour in, but perks up with the three teams trying to apprehend the Infinity Stones so they can maybe reverse what happened at the end of the previous film.Everything naturally leads to a huge battle in the last hour that I found boring, not to mention that the epilogue tended to drag on with too much of it being tedious. Still, there are lots of worthy bits throughout, like the opening, the unpredictable first encounter with Thanos, Thor getting flabby, the moving match between Black Widow and Hawkeye at the cliff\'s edge, and much more.Unfortunately, the myriad protagonists work against the film because it can\'t concentrate on any one or two characters for very long. Captain Marvel is short shifted and decidedly dull. Plus the movie\'s overlong at 3 hours, 1 minute.GRADE: B-', ""Here it is then, after eleven years and twenty one movies of differing quality, we finally reach the Endgame.But does it deliver?Does it really live up to Infinity Wars sombre ending?Yes, my goodness yes, and despite my expectations being stupendously high on the verge of me thinking that I would not enjoy it, it's easily one of the most satisfying cinema experiences that I have ever experienced.The trailer would lead you to believe that this film would be emotionally draining, the most serious of the MCU, but there is as much humour in this than any of the other phase entries, and they are genuine laugh out loud moments.But the humour does not pull the viewer away from the emotional pull that the characters pour on to the screen, and with every laugh out loud moment, there are some gut punches the film gives that will leave you reeling, if you've been even semi-invested in this behemoth of a cinematic universe.At just over three hours, Endgame truly does not feel like that, and throws some wonderful curve-balls for almost every main character, and Kudos to the Russo Brothers, they give each character a goal, an ambition, that makes you care all the more for their quest.The main meat of the film is the strained relationship between Stark and Rogers, reluctance, denial, guilt, anguish, and anger all play a part when they are together on screen.The second act is the foundation of the film, it's genius, almost jaw-dropping in the fact that it shouldn't make sense, it could easily fail, but the writers have so much respect for the franchise, and filmgoers, that it works so effortlessly.To say a lot about the third act would to give too much away, but viewers will not be disappointed. It delivers on a grandiose scale, almost delusional, but its awe-inspiring stuff.You know not to read any spoilers, and unfortunately they are so easy to find, but everyone knows not to.But rest assured, it left me stunned, satisfied and teary eyed.Marvel have done something epic, and there will not be a film like this around for a very long time."", 'In the opening, Clint Barton is teaching his daughter archery on his secluded farm while his wife prepares a picnic lunch for them. Suddenly, Clint\'s daughter vanishes and the rest of Clint\'s family disintegrates, along with half of all life across the universe, the result of Thanos\' snapping his fingers after acquiring all six Infinity Stones. Nebula and Tony Stark are stranded in space following their defeat by Thanos on Titan, but are returned to Earth by Carol Danvers and reunited with Natasha Romanoff, Bruce Banner, Steve Rogers, Rocket, Thor, and James Rhodes. The team formulates a plan to steal the Infinity Stones back from Thanos and use them to reverse his actions, but learn upon finding him that he had used the stones a second time to destroy them, preventing their further use. He tells the remaining Avengers that he did so to avoid using the Stones for further nefarious purposes. Enraged, Thor beheads Thanos, saying it\'s what he should have done in Wakanda.Five years later, Scott Lang escapes from the quantum realm to discover that his daughter Cassie is now a teenager and that Hope van Dyne, along with half of the population, has disappeared in the snap. Rogers has been leading grief counseling sessions for survivors still struggling with the effects of the snap, while Romanoff is tirelessly keeping watch over both Earth and the rest of the universe with the help of Rhodes, Danvers, Okoye, Rocket, and Nebula. Lang goes to Romanoff and Rogers, and explains that while five years had passed for them, only five hours had passed for him in the quantum realm and that time stretches much differently there. The three go to Stark, who is now raising a child with Pepper Potts, and explain their theory that the quantum realm can be used to go back in time and steal the Infinity Stones before Thanos is able to collect them. Stark initially rejects their proposal with concern about risking his family and the peace he has found, but after reflecting upon the loss of Peter Parker decides to test theoretical models that would work with Lang\'s quantum tunnel, eventually finding one that works.With Stark now on board the remaining Avengers set out to reassemble their team. Bruce Banner has now embraced the Hulk as a part of him, and has melded his own consciousness and the Hulk\'s together into one. Romanoff, after hearing reports from Rhodes of an assassin that operates with similar methods to Barton, leaves to find him. Barton, consumed with grief after the loss of his family, has been operating under the mantle ""Ronin"" while brutally massacring criminal cartels and gangs around the world in order to try and improve the world that\'s still left. Natasha finds him in Japan and after some convincing, he agrees to rejoin the team in order to try and bring his family back. Banner and Rocket go to the small town of New Asgard, where Valkyrie and the last survivors of Asgard have settled. They there find Thor, who has become overwhelmed by guilt over failing to kill Thanos in Wakanda. Thor has become overweight, his hair and beard are overgrown, and he spends his free time eating junk food, getting drunk, and playing Fortnite with his friends Korg and Miek. Thor begrudgingly agrees to return to the Avengers after some convincing from Rocket and Banner.After testing the quantum time machine on Barton, who confirms that it works, The Avengers are reunited with a plan - Banner, Rogers, Lang, and Stark embark to retrieve the Time, Mind, and Space stones during the battle of New York in 2012. Banner goes to the Sanctum Sanctorum, where he is informed by the Ancient One that taking the Time Stone from her time line would prevent Stephen Strange\'s future efforts to stop Kaecilius from destroying the laws of nature. However, when Banner tells her that Strange gave up the Time Stone willingly to Thanos, she allows Banner to have it, implying Strange had intended for a specific sequence of events to occur for Thanos to be defeated. Banner also promises the stones\' return to their proper time lines in order to prevent any ill effects. Lang and Stark attempt to steal the Space Stone after the Avengers confiscate it from Loki. Lang gives Stark\'s past self a mild cardiac arrest by pulling a circuit in his artificial heart, while Stark steals the briefcase housing the Tesseract when nobody is looking. Their plan is thwarted when Stark drops the briefcase after he is accidentally hit by the Hulk. Loki then steals the Space Stone and uses it to escape custody. Rogers succeeds in stealing the Mind Stone from undercover Hydra agents, but stumbles across his past self, who mistakes him for a disguised Loki. After defeating past-Steve, Rogers meets back up with Stark and Lang, who now must figure out another way to get the Space Stone without running out of the limited supply of Pym Particles that allow them to travel through the quantum realm. Lang returns to the present with the Mind Stone while Rogers and Stark devise a plan to steal the Space Stone from a U.S. Army installation in the 1970s, while also stealing further vials of Pym Particles in order to make the journey back home. While there, Rogers sights Peggy Carter and Stark has an meaningful conversation with his father Howard.Rocket and Thor travel to Asgard to retrieve the Reality Stone before Malekith uses it against the Nine Realms. While in Asgard, Thor is reminded that his mother, Frigga, would die soon and has a chance encounter with her while Rocket steals the Aether, the vaporized version of the Reality Stone, from Jane Foster. The two return to Earth after Frigga counsels Thor and he retrieves his hammer Mjolnor, elated to discover that he is still worthy of it. Nebula and Rhodes travel to Morag to steal the Power Stone before Peter Quill does. As Rhodes returns to the present with the Power Stone, Nebula malfunctions and remains on Morag. With two consciousnesses operating on Nebula\'s systems, Thanos and Ebony Maw discover the presence of future Nebula and go to kidnap her. Nebula realizes what has happened and tries to warn the others, but is too late. Thanos scans her memories and discovers the Avengers\' plan, and sends the more loyal past Nebula back to the present as a spy. Barton and Romanoff travel to Vormir to retrieve the Soul Stone, though are conflicted when Red Skull, keeper of the stone, informs them that it can only be retrieved by sacrificing someone they love. The two fight over which will make the sacrifice, with Romanoff ultimately taking the fall, while a distraught Barton returns to Earth with the Soul Stone.After everyone has returned to the present on Earth, Stark, Rocket, and Banner set out to craft a gauntlet to wield the stones, one constructed from the same nanotech of Stark\'s latest Iron Man suit. Banner volunteers himself to wield the gauntlet and bring back everyone that disappeared in Thanos\' snap, reasoning that he can withstand both the gamma radiation and the immense pain and injury brought on by using the stones. He succeeds, though they are almost immediately attacked by Thanos, who has been brought to Earth by the impostor Nebula, destroying the quantum portal in the process. Thanos reduces the Avengers headquarters to rubble, splitting the team up and causing the gauntlet to fall into Barton\'s protection. The past Nebula is killed by her future self as she attempts to take the Infinity Stones from Barton, while Rogers, Thor, and Stark confront Thanos, who decides he will instead use the Infinity Stones to destroy the universe and create one in his vision. The three fight Thanos one on one, with Rogers confirming Thor\'s theory that he is worthy of wielding Mjolnor, but are each bested by Thanos. Soon after Thanos\' army lands on Earth, T\'Challa appears before Rogers, along with all of the Avengers and other allies revived by Banner, before launching an assault on Thanos and his army. After a lengthy battle during which Stark is reunited with Parker and Quill is reunited with past Gamora, Thanos wrestles with numerous Avengers for the Infinity Stones. When he\'s bound by Wanda Maximoff\'s energy, Thanos orders Glaive to have his ship fire multiple energy blasts, nearly devastating the Avengers\' efforts. Captain Marvel reappears, taking out Thanos\' ship while fighting for control of the gauntlet. Using the nanotech from the new gauntlet, Stark maneuvers the Infinity Stones from Thanos\' hand to his own and uses them to turn Thanos and his entire army into ash, triumphantly stating ""I am Iron Man."" Parker and Potts console Stark as he dies from exposure to the Stones\' radiation.Following the battle, The Avengers hold a funeral for Stark, whose Mark I arc reactor is floated out on the lake next to his house. Barton and Wanda Maximoff take solace in the fact that Romanoff and Vision, who did not return in the snap, would be proud of their victory over Thanos. Thor makes Valkyrie the Queen of Asgard and joins the Guardians of the Galaxy in order to find his true purpose, free of the burden of royalty and leadership for the first time in his life. Barton returns home to his family and Parker returns to school, where he is reunited with his best friend Ned. Meanwhile, Rogers is tasked to go into the past to return the stones and Thor\'s hammer to their original time lines, but decides not to return to the present and to instead live the rest of his life in the past with Carter. He reappears before Sam Wilson and Bucky Barnes as an old man, and passes his shield and the mantle of Captain America on to Wilson. A brief flashback shows Rogers and Carter in an ordinary-looking house, finally sharing the dance they never got to have in their living room, truly happy at last.']"
49,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Spider-Man: Far From Home,6320628,"['I think it\'s a great movie with great plot and great actors. This movie is succeed in showing Peter\'s struggle as a teenager who wants to enjoy his highschool moments and being a regular-street hero, while everybody gives him pressures by telling him the next Tony Stark and he being asked to finish the ""Avengers Level-Threat"", which he doesn\'t suppose to handle. Besides the story, Tom Holland is still potraying Peter Parker in a good way alongside the supporting role of the movie, especially Jon Favreau, Jacob Batalon, and Jack Gyllenhaal. I think Jon Favreau has better potrayal as Happy in this movie as he gave a better look as assistant/father figure who support Peter wherever and whenever he needs. Jacob Batalon always serve us with fun and laugh in almost every scene he played as Ned. And Jack Gyllenhaal is the best supporting role in this movie. Twisted and Maniac. That is all I can say for his potrayal as Quentin Beck a.k.a Mysterio.The problem is the fact that everybody still compare this movie to the likes of another MCU movies, Raimi\'s Spider-Man, The Amazing Spider-Man, and many more. Please guys, this is a very different Spider-Man movie. I can say that this movie is even has a different perspective than Homecoming. Not only that, others even compared this movie with the comic, saying that they already figured out the twist or disappointed with Mysterio. Dude, there are so many fans that enjoys the movie without read or know the comic\'s first. Besides, I think anybody couldn\'t suggest that Mysterio is related to some ""legend"" even though they knew he is the main villain.I think that\'s all I can say. In brief, this is an amazing movie, just don\'t compare it with others.', ""After Into the Spiderverse and Endgame, I had pretty high expectations for Far From Home, and I was completely blown away about how good it is. As always, the cast is great, especially Tom Holland, Jake Gylanhall, and Samuel L. Jackson. The story stays together and never seems to farfetched, unlike other superhero movies (i.e, Captain Marvel; Aquaman). Like other Marvel movies, the writers do a great job with the characters. The way they wrote the characters made even minor ones like Flash, Brad, and Betty entertaining to watch. Jake Gylanhall's Mysterio stands out as being one of the best villians in the MCU. Rather than physically hurting Spider-Man, Mysterio tears him apart on the inside, using Tony Stark's death as an advantage. The effects were great and the action was also some of the best in the MCU. Overal, Spider-Man Far From Home is a great movie and easily one of the best (if not the best) in the MCU. Also, stick around after the credits for two surprises, especially if you are a Raimi fan"", ""I had my doubts going to see it, I was hoping not to mess it up and they didn't! It was good, Tom did an amazing job, like he was born to play Peter! And the entire cast was lovely! The reminders to Endgame were timed perfectly and inserted as to not bother but still be present, some explanations were given as to what happened in the 5 year gap with some of them, they were funny and silly and stupid like any teenagers should be. And there was enough action as to keep you tensed. I loved it and I do hope they continue making good Spiderman movies! PS my only question is how come Fury had a phone signal in space!?!"", ""And so my long Marvel-watching journey comes to an end; I've finally caught up with the endless franchise, after what seems like eons playing catch-up with the rest of the world's population. Sadly, this SPIDER-MAN sequel is a real step down from the highs of AVENGERS: ENDGAME, and a feeling like they've gone backwards given how they learnt what worked so well previously. Personally, I've found both of Holland's outings as the web-slinging hero to be middling at best.This one starts off okay, with a first half mixing the usual lame high school gags and characterisation with some decent and destructive set-pieces; Jake Gyllenhaal is a nice choice of supporting actor too. However, a crucial twist halfway through renders the second half extremely mundane, building to a climax which is silly and predictable as it is hollow and contrived. Fans tend to lap this stuff up due to its well-meaning nature, but I expect a lot more from this kind of budget."", 'I just went to the cinema and I loved the movie so much. It had all the elements that you could want from this kind of movie. It was funny, beautifully made, it had the right kind of action and Tom Holland amazing as Spider Man. Also normally I think movies that get a second version tend to be a bit worse. But in my opinion it was even better than the the first ""Homecoming"" :)', ""Simply amazing, all around great script and acting. Tom and Zendaya, I love the awkward moments. Everything about this movie is got my senses tingling. Love,love,love. 10 stars, can't to buy it on vudu."", ""This film had everything in it! A perfect story after the amazing Endgame film that really sets you up and gets you excited for the future of the MCU movies! Once again Tom Holland is amazing as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, gives you such a comic feel about the character and that makes me so happy! It also had sick twists that weren't expected (unless you are a true comic book fan like me) and so much action that throughout the run of the film! I would really recommend watching it! I will definitely properly watch it again if I had the chance too😁"", 'Brilliant Movie A Teenager Who Is Busy To Handel Its Personal + Super Hero Life At Same Time All The Actions Scene + GCI Scene Is Amazing & Perfect....', 'As a child my favourite Superhero was always Peter Parker. I could always find a way to identify with his awkwardness and real life issues. Starting in homecoming and now realized in far from home, that Spiderman story is being told. Tom Holland is excellent. Actually all the actors were just spot on in this movie. All the call backs, all the Easter eggs. I am overwhelmed. This took off where Endgame left off. The Blip, the pathos, the grief and the true consequences starting to be revealed. The down to earth nature of the hero and his development. Spidey Sense finally being used. Standing ovation action sequences, real danger. Real surprise, the Mysterio reveal was incredible. Spiderman true identity and Nick Fury and SWORD. I cannot wait for Black Widow!!!', ""I really enjoyed this movie, and personally found it a satisfying sequel to Endgame. Tom Holland delivered an emotional performance as Spider-Man, effectively capturing how the events of Endgame affect Peter Parker. I also enjoyed Mysterio as a villain. He was evil in all of the right ways, and I liked that he had a clear motive that he didn't give up on. Even the romance between Peter and MJ was done well. While it could come across as a bit cheesy, I found it to be an accurate portrayal of a teen relationship. The post credit scenes were surprising, and they definitely added a twist to the story. I am interested to see how that is addressed in future marvel movies. All in all this is a great film, and I think any mcu fan will love it!"", 'It is no secret that my All-Time Favorite comic book character is Spider-Man. No matter how much I love other characters, the Friendly-Neighborhood wall crawler will always be my favorite, and I mean the one TRUE Spider-Man, Peter Parker.This movie has tons of surprises and reviewing it without spoiling is hard but I will say it is by far one of the best MCU entries thus far and of the best Spidey movies I have ever seen. While we have seen Peter Parker in at least nine movies, Tom Holland keeps proving he is the best of them all, this film feels like ripped off from the Marvel Comic pages, it is true to the source and it is nothing short of amazing.It has a talented cast, a great story, lots and lots of humor and amazing connections to the larger MCU that will pull emotional strings you did not know you had.The filmmakers have truly given us an ""Amazing"" Spider-Man film and I cannot be fair if I don\'t rate this a 10/10.After Marvel\'s Avengers: Endgame this movie had a lot to prove and it did. It even had me singing ""look out, there comes the Spider-Man!""', ""The best ever Spider-Man movie ever made was Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 2,but this one just at got so close to it, an excellent made movie from beggining to ned, the beggining was something that will sweep you off your feet, it's mesmerizing from the beggining you won't blink and an excellent story telling, Holland was just great, Jake Gyllenhaal's role is amazing whenever you see a scene he's in, you will feel the mass of how good he is. Great cast well chosen, Zendaya played a very good part in making the story even bigger, Spider-Man #FARFROMHOME is one of the best movies of thie summer."", 'This is amazing movies with teenage backgroud... i love the charcter chemistry, Mysterio is awesome villain!!', 'Perfect spiderman film. Perfect Mysterio. Perfect rating.', 'Such a great movie, it had everything, comedy, action, drama, and an amazing storyline. Must see in theaters', 'Just got back from seeing this... Wow!! Might be my favourite marvel movie yet! Absolutely amazing.', 'Far from home was under a lot of pressure from Endgame and homecoming in order to live up to the expectations set by both movies. It had to confront the problems and heartbreak from the last Mcu film while retaining the humour and action from the previous Spider-Man film. Not only does it do this far more successfully than I could have imagined, yet it adds so much more to the film. From unexpected plot twits to silly romance. This film is a must see to any fan of the Mcu. Make sure you stay till the very very end. You will regret it if you leave early. Post credit scenes will blow your mind in a short space of time', 'I enjoyed every second of it. I even went to the theater twice and came out with a big smile on my face each time', ""Wow this movie was truly amazing. I'm a 50 yr old mom that has enjoyed all of the marvel avengers movies from the first iron man through endgame watched them all w my kids and I'll admit I'm still reeling w the loss of Ironman and others after endgame and was very skeptical about what's next.... and wow. This movie is like new life a new superstar and wow the twists at the end absolutely incredible. Bravo. A whole new era with adorable Spider-Man leading the way. I'm hooked the twists and hilarious post credit scene has me eagerly looking forward to what's next!"", 'I watched Spider Man Far From Home in 3D . Such great 3D effects. As we come towards the story line . It is the best spiderman movie with the best script written perhaps . 10 on 10 ✅✅ Tom Holland has done an excellent job in the film . It is a must watch film for all die hard marvel fans .! 🕷🕸', ""Ever since I saw the trailers and sneaks peek of the movie, I kept getting more and more excited, realizing that Far From Home was going to be even better than Homecoming and I Was Right. Far From Home was so AMAZING. There was so much more action, humour, heart and romance compared to Homecoming. I loved every minute watching the movie and I love Tom Holland as Peter Parker. He is by far the best actor to portray the character and he is even better than ever. I just love him SO MUCH. Everything about the movie was incredible, all the references and flashbacks to several previous Marvel films and the special effects were incredible.However, one of the main primary reasons why I LOVE the movie is the romance between Peter and MJ. I was never a fan of the romance between Liz and Peter in Homecoming since I never really felt any chemistry between them and there was not enough development or screentime for their relationship whereas it's completely different with Peter and MJ. I can really feel the chemistry and love between them which only grows stronger as the film progressed which clearly proves that Peter's feelings for MJ are a whole lot more stronger and serious than any feelings he ever had for Liz. Plus, I really enjoyed the love triangle between Peter, MJ and Brad as watching Peter fight for the girl he loves is what makes the romance even greater.I also loved the scenes between Peter and Happy. They are so close and it was so heartwarming to see them comfort one another since they are still grieving the loss of Tony. It was touching. The topic of Tony's passing and his successor is one of the main highlights of the movie. It shows how Peter is struggling, how he still hasn't gotten over the loss of his beloved mentor who was like a father to him and his fears that he will never live up to the legacy Tony left behind. It's wonderful to see how Peter and Happy are there for each other and one of the best moments is the look of pride and happiness in Happy's eyes when he watches Peter working on his new suit, truly reminding him of Tony. Not to mention, the romance between Happy and May was a nice touch and so HILARIOUS, Especially the Confession.In the end, I'm thrilled as Far From Home was everything I wanted and more. I can't wait to see the next Spider-Man film and I hope there are a whole lot more movies to come in the future. I'm looking forward to seeing what the next chapter will be for Peter since he will have his hands full no doubt following the shocking events from the ending credits. Overall, Spider-Man: Far From Home clearly surpasses Spider-Man: Homecoming. It was truly, Amazing, Spectacular, Stupendous and above all officially one of my Top Favourite Movies EVER."", 'I was absolutely shocked at how great this movie was and how well it explained the 5 year event.

The end credits was everything make sure you stay til the screen is fully black.', ""Endgame is just beginning of the end. There's more"", ""I went inside the theater with limited expectations. High expectations for entertainment (of course, for a Marvel movie). I was okay with Mysterio being different from the comics (as from the trailers), so I sit down prepared to have fun. First quarter of the movie, it's okay for a Marvel movie, reminds me of the previous Spider-Man but something was off. That something would prove to make the plot of the second and third part of the movie.It was AWESOME. The Mysterio moments are perfectly executed. I just couldn't believe they manage to make Mysterio realistic (as far as possible) and still feel fun.And there are like 2 (or 3) moments where you feel the movie is ended but then BAM, it's not over yet. And I love those moments if done well. And they are done close to perfection in this one.I don't score it for philosophy or being a movie that will mark you, no, I score it for the amount of fun and the flow of the story and how close to making sense it feels. It's one of those movies where you don't want it to end."", 'The film opens in a Mexican city, where Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders) have arrived to investigate the area after a reported cyclone ""with a face"" had torn through the city. Moments later, the two encounter a being known as an Elemental, specifically the one that can manipulate earth. Fury and Maria are met by a man in a super-powered suit named Quentin Beck (Jake Gyllenhaal), and he helps the two fight the Earth Elemental.Cut to Midtown School of Science and Technology where Betty Brant (Angourie Rice) and Jason Ionello (Jorge Lindeborg, Jr) are doing their daily school news report, but they start with an ""In Memoriam"" dedicated to Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, and Vision. Betty recaps the events of The Snap (or ""The Blip"", as it is called here from \'Avengers: Endgame\'), with many students having been dusted away before returning to life and finding that some of their younger classmates have now surpassed them physically.Peter Parker (Tom Holland) discusses with Ned Leeds (Jacob Batalon) his plans to win over Michelle Jones/MJ (Zendaya), on whom he has developed a crush. They are prepping for a class trip to Europe, and Peter hopes that he can tell her how he feels.Peter later attends a fundraiser as Spider-Man, with Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) there to support him (and we learn that she got ""blipped"" too). They are met by Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau), who appears to be flirting with May. He gives Peter a heads-up that Fury is going to call him, which he does almost instantly, but Peter ignores him since he has other things to worry about. He returns outside as Spidey to talk to reporters, but they overwhelm him with questions about becoming the new Iron Man or the next lead Avenger, so he leaves.The class later heads out for the trip, with Peter choosing to leave the Spidey suit behind to enjoy his vacation, but he later finds that May packed it for him anyway. They are chaperoned by Mr. Harrington (Martin Starr) and Mr. Dell (J.B. Smoove), and are joined by other students, including Flash Thompson (Tony Revolori), who is still a big Spidey fan but also still dumps on Peter. On the plane, Peter tries to get Ned to help him switch seats so that he can sit with MJ, but Ned only causes Mr. Harrington to take Peter while MJ is seated next to Brad Davis (Remy Hii), who is one of the kids that didn\'t get dusted and grew into a handsome athletic superstar. Peter is clearly jealous, while Ned sits next to Betty, and they end up becoming a couple.The class arrives in Venice, Italy for their first stop. They stay in a crummy hotel, but they take time to enjoy the sights, while Peter tries to get closer to MJ. Suddenly, the water levels on the ground start rising. Soon, a massive Water Elemental begins to wreak havoc upon the city, using water to flood the city or destroy buildings. Peter tries to do something about it, but he left his Spidey suit at the hotel. Beck arrives and uses his powers to fight the Water Elemental. He is able to subdue the creature\'s attacks before ultimately splitting the creature in two. He is seen as a hero by Peter\'s classmates, and after watching a news report on him, they start to call him ""Mysterio"".Peter and Ned go back to their room, but Ned gets tranquilized by Fury. He has been trying to get Peter\'s attention, and it hasn\'t worked until now. They have to leave the room to talk in private since everyone keeps interrupting them. Fury takes Peter to his secret hideout to meet Maria and Beck. Beck explains that he is from an alternate Earth, which is where the Elementals are coming from. This was supposedly caused by The Snap, and Beck claims that the Fire Elemental was the one that destroyed his home world and his family. Fury wants Peter\'s help in fighting back, but he feels he isn\'t the Avenger that is qualified to fight beings like these.Fury hijacks the class\'s vacation by having his employee, Dimitri (Numan Acar), act as a driver to their new and unexpected destination, Prague, as Fury and Beck have learned that\'s where the Fire Elemental is set to strike. Before heading out, Peter is taken by a tall woman sent by Fury to give him a stealth suit. She orders him to take off his clothes and put it on, but he is found by Brad, who takes a pic of Peter in what looks like a compromising position. Peter runs after him to get rid of the pic, but Brad says he knows that Peter likes MJ too, and he thinks showing her this will make her lean more toward Brad. On their trip, Peter finds Tony\'s high-tech glasses, EDITH (voice of Dawn Michelle King) (stands for ""Even Dead, I\'m The Hero""), which Tony left for his successor. Peter asks EDITH to handle Brad, which is misinterpreted as a request for an attack. Peter has to (somewhat) discreetly stop the incoming drone from killing Brad, as well as the whole class. He just has EDITH hack into Brad\'s phone and delete the picture.After arriving in Prague, Mr. Harrington tells the students that they were given tickets to the opera, which ruins their plans to go to the carnival, but it was planned by Fury to keep Peter\'s friends inside to avoid being caught in the path of the Fire Elemental. Peter is forced to stay outside and be on the lookout, which ruins HIS plan to sit next to MJ. She follows him outside, and Ned and Betty follow since they think the other two are headed for the carnival. Outside, the Fire Elemental emerges and begins to rampage. Spidey and Mysterio team up against the beast, trying to avoid letting it touch metal, or else it will get more powerful. Ned and Betty are trapped on the Ferris wheel as Spidey tries to save them, while Mysterio fights the Fire Elemental. Spidey fires a web at the beast, which pulls something out of it and makes it land near a hidden MJ. Mysterio then uses his powers to dive into the Fire Elemental\'s chest and destroy it. Peter goes down to make sure he is okay. However, he still gets chewed out by Fury for not doing what he told him to.As the gang moves to Berlin, Peter and Beck are called by Fury and Maria to discuss forming a new team. Peter privately meets with Beck, and Peter thinks that Beck is the one that truly deserves EDITH, since he thinks Tony only left it for him to choose who is worthy of succeeding Iron Man. After Peter leaves, Beck takes down what has been a whole illusion in a dilapidated building. Everyone there works for him, and they are all disgruntled former employees of Stark Industries. Beck has been making up the Elementals to get people to see him as the hero, using drones to create the destruction left behind by their appearances. He and everyone there have been pissed at Tony for stealing their work, his Binary Augmented Retro Framing (BARF), and they have all worked together to get people to forget about Iron Man or Spider-Man, and to make way for Mysterio.Peter goes back to the hotel to invite MJ to go out with him without anybody else. As he tries to tell her how he feels, she cuts him off to reveal she knows he\'s Spider-Man, due to the many ""coincidences"" involving them being in the same places at the same time. She then pulls out what she found at the site of the Fire Elemental fight, a projector that shows Mysterio fighting the as-yet-unseen Air Elemental. The two realize that Beck is behind the Elementals and that he is a fraud. As Beck and his goons prepare for the Air Elemental ""Avengers level"" attack, they find that the missing projector from one of their drones is in Peter\'s hands.Peter goes to meet with Fury and Maria about Beck\'s true motives, but it turns out Beck has caught up to Peter first and has created an entire illusion to trap him in. He taunts Peter for not being the hero he wants to be, and even forces him to endure a projection of Tony bursting from his grave and coming out to terrorize him. It appears as though Fury subdues Beck and asks Peter who else he told about Beck, and he admits that he told MJ, Ned, and that Ned probably told Betty. This turns out to be another one of Beck\'s tricks, and now he knows to kill Peter\'s friends. He also puts Peter in the path of a train, which appears to strike him, but Peter is merely hurt really bad, and he passes out on the train.Peter wakes up in a jail cell in the Netherlands. After breaking out, he calls Happy to come get him. While Happy tends to his wounds, Peter breaks down and says that he doesn\'t get why Tony would pick him as a successor when he keeps screwing everything up. Happy reassures him that Tony believed in him for a reason, and that he knew Peter would be the hero he needs to be. Peter picks himself up and goes to create himself a new suit from Tony\'s computer before they head to London to rescue his friends.The class is taking a tour bus ride around London, but it\'s driven by one of Beck\'s goons. They stop on the London Bridge as Mysterio gets the Air Elemental ready to attack. Spidey shows up in a new suit for battle. Happy goes to get Ned, MJ, Betty, and Flash, but his jet gets blown up and they have to hide in a medieval tower as the drones go after them. They hide in a room, but MJ manages to knock down a drone with a mace before having to stay locked in a room. Spidey enters the illusion of the Air Elemental and webs all the drones together to get them to crash and break the illusion. He proceeds to destroy more drones before Mysterio has him cornered and faces a horde of drones directed at him while under an illusion. Using his Spider-Sense, Spidey dodges all the drones, destroys them all, and in the chaos, one of them shoots Mysterio. Peter goes to get EDITH, but Beck attempts one last illusion to kill him, and it fails, leaving Beck to die in disgrace. Peter then disables all the drones. Afterwards, he and MJ run onto the bridge to meet with each other. They acknowledge their mutual feelings, and they kiss. Fury tries to get Peter again, but Happy tells him to leave the kid alone since he\'s with his new girlfriend.The students return home. Peter sits Happy and May down to discuss their apparently developing relationship, but while Happy thinks they are an item, May thinks they just had a fling. Peter then goes out to meet MJ for a date as Spidey. He takes her for a swing around the city, although the heights freak her out.Mid-Credits: After their ""date"", Spidey drops MJ off in the streets. They then overhear a breaking news broadcast in the middle of the city. Apparently, Beck recorded a video before his death and sent it to the Daily Bugle. It is shown by none other than the ruthless and antagonistic chief editor J. Jonah Jameson (played by none other than J.K. Simmons), and what plays is a doctored video done by Beck to make people think Spider-Man orchestrated the drone attacks on London. Beck then outs Spidey as Peter Parker to the whole city, leaving New Yorkers in disbelief over their hero, and putting Peter in a very troubling position...Post-Credits: Fury and Maria are revealed to have been the Skrulls Talos (Ben Mendelsohn) and his wife Soren (Sharon Blynn). They were ordered by Fury to give EDITH to Peter, and Talos gives Fury an update on what had just happened. Fury is then shown to be relaxing on a Skrull ship, which he is apparently commandeering.']"
50,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Black Widow,3480822,"[""It's 1995 Ohio. Alexei Shostakov (David Harbour), Melina Vostokoff (Rachel Weisz), and their 'daughters' Natasha Romanoff and Yelena Belova are a Russian sleeper cell working for General Dreykov (Ray Winstone). 21 years later after the events of Civil War, Natasha (Scarlett Johansson) is on the run. She goes for a safe house in Budapest where she runs into Yelena (Florence Pugh).The good part of this movie is introducing the 'family' into the Marvel universe. They are a surprisingly fun group. I was not expecting comedy. As for the plot, it's a standard James Bond plot. It's fine. It's able to fill in some of Natasha's history. It crosses a few items off the Marvel checklist. It could be better. It's obvious that the family is coming back in future Marvel stuff and that has good potential. I'm still not a fan of bringing Elaine into the Marvel world but that's a different rant altogether."", 'Black Widow gets a standalone prequel that owes more than a nod to James Bond. There is even a glimpse of Roger Moore in Moonraker.I wonder if Disney were eyeing up a purchase of MGM before Amazon swooped in. It was one way to get their hands on 007.The movie opens in 1995. Alexei Shostakov (David Harbour) Melina Vostokoff (Rachel Weisz) and their daughters Natasha Romanoff and Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh) suddenly have to leave America.They are Russian sleeper agents and they have been exposed. The family have been working for General Dreykov (Ray Winstone) and they are not a real family.In 2016 after the events of Civil War. Natasha is on the run. Yelena kills a rogue former Black Widow and comes in contact with a synthetic gas. The frees her from a chemical that controls her mind. She is an operative of Dreykov.Both Natasha and Yelena reunite and then later get together with their surrogate parents. They want to bring down Dreykov who Natasha tried to assassinate some years earlier.After the events of Avengers: Endgame. There is something small scale about Black Widow. Nothing high stakes such as the fate of the entire universe being in peril. The movie suffers from not being a bombastic superhero movie.It really is an efficient spy/action movie with a couple of twists and turn. Harbour provides comedy as the Red Guardian. Weisz if effective as the mother figure but is underused.Winstone though seems to be coasting as the villain with a shifting Russian accent.', 'This comes after the Civil War and before the blink. We get a quick back story of the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) quicker than what I had wished. Her entire training is done during the opening credits. I was hoping for more and her conversion etc. We get to meet her pseudo family of Florence Pugh, Rachel Weisz, and David Harbour who we already met as Alexi. Together they must save the world from Draykov (Ray Winstone) and his legion of Black Widows located world wide.It was not the film I wanted. Florence Pugh stole scenes from Scarlett Johansson, something I did not think possible. She points out the the Black Window always has that three point pose followed by a hair flip. This is what separates Marvel from DC: the dialogue is more entertaining.', 'Can Phase 4 start with another Origin story? A movie that works without any knowledge of what has gone on before or what will happen next? I would argue that it can work. Of course having some knowledge of the timeline is not a bad thing to have. And while this starts off before other big events, it mainly plays between Civil War (which was an Captain America movie, even though all the Avengers were in it) and Infinity War.And it sort of literally closes a gap and gives us more Black Widow. Yes this movie was something a lot of people wanted to see a long time ago. But the way they put and the story they are telling - it works quite fine. It is more of spy thriller kind of thing rather than a superhero movie (a lot of superhero kind of stuff still happens) - there is even a clip on the telly (TV) showing us James Bond.But amongst all the action and all the frenzy and all the becoming or growing as a character (Black Widow but also her allies), there is a lot of family stuff happening. Which is funny, considering that the family thing is a front. Now I am not alone in saying that this is an allegory not just on family life but the American (way of) Life. And while the addition of the American Pie song might have been an ad lib or last minute addition, it sums it up really good in more than one way. And just when you least expect it, the song also might get a tear out of you. Or at least make you sentimental.The performances are great and the way a big machine like Marvel still allows performers to do and bring their own ideas shows on screen. The chemistry between the characters and the fun they are having on set. And then there are pigs - a friend was reminded of Bullets of Justice ... I have to admit, this could work as a prequel to that too (this is a violent movie, do not seek it out if you are easily offended and squeamish).All that aside, yes there are ridiculous things happening, yes many things are removed from reality, but it has quite the courage to go places, that you may not expect - for a Marvel movie and all that. And when towards the end ... well a certain piece of music/theme is playing ... if you have been a fan of the Avengers universe and the movies before, you will get emotional. I can guarantee you that.And as always there is something in the credits. Actually after the credits (this time no one left the theatre, they have been trained well like myself) - one little scene that sets up a ""future project"" ... which is not that far in the future, but you\'ll know once you see it.', 'Another par for the course entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. That\'s not to be read as good or bad, it simply is. The film traces the background story of Natasha Romanoff, the Avengers\' Black Widow, portrayed by Scarlett Johansson. Everyone in her childhood family has a different last name which all gets sorted out by the end of the picture, but if you\'re not familiar with the character, it might get confusing for a while. You won\'t see as much real estate destroyed in this story, which sets it apart from some other Marvel flicks. In fact most of the damage is confined to villain Dreykov\'s (Ray Winstone) Red Room, which is a bit of a misnomer once you get to see what that\'s all about. There is a \'world at stake\' component to the movie, but that\'s mostly confined to the mind control aspect of all the \'widows\' Dreykov has positioned in far flung corners of the globe. That facet of the story doesn\'t even get to play out, as most of the action involves Natasha and her \'sister\' Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh) joining forces to take down Dreykov, and restore free will to all the Widows under his spell. There\'s a fair amount of humor in the story, mostly understated, and most of it involving Alexei Shostakov (David Harbour), father of our sister heroes. There\'s a running gag in the story, that quite frankly, I wondered how long it would take for one of the comic book movie franchises to deal with, and that\'s the whole idea of super-hero posing. You know what I\'m talking about, the good guy (or gal) in question heroically drops from the sky with one knee to the ground, opposite fist planted squarely to the Earth, and holding the pose momentarily for the audience to marvel at (oops, no pun intended there). Pugh\'s character got that ball rolling and the script writers milked it for a couple more humorous scenes. You have to admit, it does look a bit pretentious, but at the same time, pretty cool as well. The after credits scene isn\'t really a big surprise, since we knew of Black Widow\'s ultimate fate with the finale of ""Avengers: End Game"". But if you didn\'t know or forgot, it might come as a bit of a shocker, as it points to a sequel of sorts with the ""Hawkeye"" mini-series due out later this year. And lest the movie itself reminds you of the kind of action that takes place in a James Bond film, you might consider that some of it\'s inspiration might have come from the 1979 film ""Moonraker"". It\'s what Natasha was watching on TV during an early scene of the movie.', 'The Marvel Cinematic Universe had its huge financial success with Avengers: Endgame, and then we had Spider-Man: Far from Home to continue the franchise, but we had to wait over a year for the next instalment, which brought back a departed character for her own solo adventure. Basically, in 1995, young Natasha Romanoff (Ever Anderson) and Yelena Belova (Violet McGraw) were raised in Ohio by surrogate parents, Russian undercover agents, super-soldier Alexei Shostakov (David Harbour), aka the Red Guardian, Russia\'s Captain America, and Black Widow Melina Vostokoff (Rachel Weisz). The family are forced to escape to Cuba, General Dreykov (Ray Winstone) takes Romanoff and Belova to the Red Room for training. Years later, Shostakov is imprisoned in Russia, while Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) defects to S. H. I. E. L. D. after bombing Dreykov\'s Budapest office, apparently killing him and his young daughter Antonia (Ryan Kiera Armstrong). In 2016, after the Avengers have parted ways (Civil War), Romanoff is a fugitive, escaped from U. S. Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt) and flees to a safehouse in Norway supplied by Rick Mason (O-T Fagbenle). Meanwhile, Belova (Florence Pugh) kills a rogue former Black Widow but encounters a synthetic gas called Red Dust that neutralises control of her mind. Belova sends the antidote to Romanoff hoping that she will return to help her free the other Widows. Romanoff unknowingly drives off with Red Dust, she is attacked by deadly masked agent Taskmaster (Olga Kurylenko) who wants the antidote. After evading Taskmaster, she realises that the antidote came from Belova. The two reunite in Budapest, where they are attacked by mind-controlled Black Widows. While escaping, Romanoff learns Dreykov is alive, and the Red Room is still active. Romanoff was haunted by the memory of detonating the building with young Antonia inside whilst targeting Dreykov. Romanoff and Belova evade Taskmaster and meet back up with Mason who supplies them with a helicopter. Romanoff and Belova break Shostakov out of prison to learn where Dreykov is, and he tells them that they need to speak to Vostokoff. On a farm outside Saint Petersburg, Vostokoff has experimenting with chemical mind control on pigs. There, Belova reveals that while they were not a real family, she believed they were so. Vostokoff admits she sent their location to Dreykov, and soon agents arrive and take them to the Red Room, an aerial facility. On the base, it is revealed that Vostokoff and Romanoff have switched places using face mask technology before they were captured, allowing Vostokoff to free Shostakov and Belova from their restraints. Meanwhile, Romanoff confronts Dreykov, who sees through her disguise. Romanoff learns Taskmaster is Antonia, who survived the explosion but suffered severe damage. Dreykov implanted a chip in her head, turning her into the perfect soldier, capable of mimicking the actions of anyone she sees, including several Avengers. Romanoff attempts to kill Dreykov but fails to harm him due to a pheromone lock installed in her and every Widow. Dreykov reveals that he controls Widows worldwide via his desk console. Romanoff intentionally breaks her nose, severing her nasal passage to avoid the pheromone, and then attacks Dreykov. Shostakov battles Taskmaster, while Vostokoff destroys one of the facility\'s engines, and Belova searches for the other Widows, who are controlled to protect Dreykov. Together, Shostakov and Belova lock Taskmaster in a cell. Dreykov escapes as the Widows attack Romanoff, but Belova explodes an antidote bomb that releases all the Widows from mind control. Romanoff gets into the control desk and copies the locations of the other Widows around the world as the facility begins to explode and fall. Romanoff retrieves the two surviving vials of the Red Dust and frees Taskmaster from the locked cell. Vostokoff and Shostakov escape in a plane just as Belova takes out Dreykov\'s helicopter, killing him. Romanoff gives Belova a parachute before battling Taskmaster in freefall. After landing, Romanoff uses the antidote on Taskmaster, freeing her from servitude. The freed Widows arrive as Belova, Vostokoff, and Shostakov say goodbye to Romanoff. She gives Belova the last antidote vial and the portable drive, telling her to free all other still mind-controlled Widows. As they leave with Antonia, Romanoff awaits Ross and his men, who have arrived to apprehend her. Two weeks later, Romanoff reunites with Mason, who supplies her with a Quinjet; she intends to free the imprisoned Avengers. In a scene set after Romanoff\'s death, Belova meets Contessa Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) at Romanoff\'s grave. De Fontaine assigns Clint Barton aka Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), whom she claims is responsible for Romanoff\'s death, as Belova\'s next target. Also starring Liani Samuel as Lerato and Michelle Lee as Oksana. Johansson carries the film as the superspy, Pugh is a welcome new addition as the no-nonsense assassin with deadpan putdowns, boorish Harbour and mysterious Weisz offer great support, and Winstone is a little pantomime but not a bad villain. This answers the question from Avengers Assemble about the infamous Budapest mission, it a good story with spies and mind-control, with a witty script, there are plenty of fantastic special effects-ladened chase and fight sequences to feast your eyes on, and it leaves room for emotional and funny moments (mocking the ""pose"" is a great in-joke) as well, a terrific superhero fantasy action. Very good!', 'Right, well I am not one that gets all excited whenever Marvel puts out a new movie, given the fact that I am not particularly keen on the superhero movie genre. So the whole MCU deal is not really something that gets me worked up. Sure, I watch the superhero movies because they provide adequate entertainment and have over the top special effects, and that is about it.So of course I ended up watching ""Black Widow"" as well, as I was presented with the opportunity to watch it. I went in expecting little in terms of proper entertaining, believing it to be yet another visually astounding experiences that covers up for a shallow storyline.And I was actually genuinely entertained and surprised with the outcome of ""Black Widow"". This movie was a movie that felt like a good old fashioned fast paced action movie. Especially since there weren\'t superhero powers involved here, so this 2021 movie was up alongside the likes of ""Batman"" in terms of me having an interest in it.The storyline told in ""Black Widow"", as written by Eric Pearson, Jac Schaeffer and Ned Benson was actually interesting and turned out to be more than just your average superhero smackdown. I liked the story told here, and it definitely added depth to the Natasha Romanoff character (played by Scarlett Johansson).Visually then you will be in for another top notch special effects galore, as with all other Marvel superhero movies. The special effects teams that worked on ""Black Widow"" definitely delivered, and then some. This movie was through the roof.The action scenes in ""Black Widow"" were fast paced and adrenaline filled, which was something that really appealed to me.""Black Widow"" does have a good ensemble of actors and actresses on the cast list, with the likes of Scarlett Johansson, Florence Pugh, David Harbour, Rachel Weisz and a short appearance by William Hurt.I have no doubts that the 2021 movie ""Black Widow"" from director Cate Shortland is not going to please the fans of the MCU, as someone like me (not at all a fan of the superhero genre) could be more than genuinely entertained.My rating of ""Black Widow"" lands on a seven out of ten stars.', ""I think that I am quite hard to please when it comes to superhero films, but Scarlett Johansson and Florence Pugh are definite plus points. Of course, a decent script and plenty of mind-blowing action also helps and I'm glad to say that Black Widow delivers both a strong story and lots of incredible, special effects packed set-pieces. For those not overly familiar with every entry in the MCU, the film might prove a little confusing at first, but it all eventually slots into place and ultimately proves to be a highly entertaining blockbuster comic-book adventure.As children, Natasha and Yelena are part of a Russian sleeper cell based in Ohio, their 'father' Alexei (David Harbour) and 'mother' Melina (Rachel Weisz) working for General Dreykov (Ray Winstone), who oversees the Red Room academy where young girls are trained to be assassins: Black Widows. After completing their mission, the family escape the U. S. and the girls are sent to Dreykov for training. Twenty-one years later, Natasha (Johansson) has defected to America to become a member of the Avengers, and is now on the run as a fugitive (can't remember why); meanwhile, Yelena (Pugh) is still working as a killer, under the influence of a powerful mind control serum. When she inhales an antidote and regains her free will, Yelena contacts her 'sister' and together they endeavour to kill Dreykov and destroy the Red Room, all the while avoiding deadly killing machine Taskmaster (Olga Kurylenko).I don't know who Cate Shortland is, or how she got this plum directing gig (there's nothing in her resumé to suggest that she could handle a movie of this type), but she does a surprisingly good job, combining action, comedy, and drama to good effect, with a decent pace sustained throughout the two-and-a-quarter hour runtime. The performances are solid (although Winstone's Russian accent occasionally slips), with particularly good turns from Pugh (who makes amends for Midsommar) and Harbour (who provides much of the humour), the fight choreography and CGI is very impressive, and, perhaps most importantly, the film is a whole lot of fun, from the white-knuckle opening scene to the spectacular explosive final act."", ""I think the wake is definitely worth it! The story is very engaging because of the family theme. There's a lot of action, and I was entranced throughout the film. The visuals are amazing. There are a few funny jokes to balance the film too. The scene with Florence Pugh posing made the cinema laughed out loud. I really enjoyed this film."", 'Florence Pugh carried this movie, her and David Harbour laid down some seriously good comedic moments. The action was as over the top as any other marvel movie so on brand there. The acting was okay and CGI was expectedly good. It felt like Johansson took a back seat to other characters which was disappointing.', ""Black Widow ( Scarlett Johansson) must deal with a villain from her past and her long-absent family.LOUD, confusing and far too long. It starts off OK but quickly falls apart and becomes confusing and convoluted. The film is also way too long--it doesn't need to run over 2 hours. There's also tons of CGI at the end--way too much. The acting is OK. In short a long forgettable MCU movie."", 'I was expecting a typical, CGI-infused Avenger movie, and it certainly is that. Black Widow, though, has a lot in common with James Bond movies. There\'s even a scene in which 007 is playing on TV. The Black Widow must stop a Russian General called Dreykov, a sort of SPECTRE czar megalomaniac who ""rescues"" unwanted girls and turns them into super assassins, called widows. Widows go through extensive training. A select few get chosen. The rest are killed. This makes Dreykov a monstrous misogynist, in a movie, directed by a woman, Cate Shortland, which has unmistakable feminist themes. There are two main Black Widows: Scarlett Johansson\'s character, and Yelena Belova, played by Florence Pugh. Belova is impulsive where Romanoff is introspective. The two are sisters only in that they grew up as part of a Russian cell, in an Ohio suburb, along with Rachel Weisz as their brilliant scientist mother, and David Harbour, as Red Guardian, Russia\'s version of Captain America, as the dad.The action set pieces, and fight scenes were good, but no better or worse than your typical Marvel Avenger movie. There are the standard wisecracks, as Johansson and Pugh riff on each other. Yelena teases Natasha\'s signature landing move, with one arm extended behind, the other hand on the floor, and legs spread apart, a fighting stance Yelena finds diva-like and pretentious, and is disgusted with herself when performing the same pose. The chemistry between Scarlett Johansson and Florence Pugh is nimble and enjoyable. The scenes with David Harbour, arm wrestling people in a gulag prison, are also very funny. In summary, this is a solid, fun Marvel movie, with a hint we will be seeing more of Black Widow Yelena Belova.', 'Shortly after the events of Civil War, Natasha(Johansson, yet again nailing the ""carrying the weight of all the awful things she did before reforming"", which here is made one of the primary themes, along with how found family can help process pain, especially if it is a shared experience) meets back up with the three people (none of whom are actually related by blood) she shared (what little she had of) her childhood with: sister Yelena(Pugh, delivering several, perhaps more than any other one performer, of the many emotional gut punches), mother Melina(Weisz, applying her substantial brains to the situation) and father Alexei(Harbour, both legitimately trying to be parental figures, and occasionally really getting it right), to once and for all accomplish what Romanoff honestly believed she head done decades ago: Kill the evil General Dreykov(Winstone, as usual being deeply compelling as a vicious individual, here a misogynist), and destroy the Red Room, where all Black Widows are broken down, trained, and stripped of any individuality.Obviously, it would have been even better if this had come out years ago. Actually, with a little rewriting, this could easily have come out an entire decade ago. Regardless of any other aspect, the fact that this stars a woman in the titular role has had people saying for years that it would automatically be bad. It\'s hard to argue that this would have come out upwards of 10 years ago, if not for that one aspect. I think a lot of people would have, and many, I\'m sure, did, advise that it not rock the boat any more than that. So it\'s hard for me to overstate my relief and joy at finding that the movie is unapologetically feminist. It uses the spy training, which includes kidnapping girls when they are children, to explore trauma caused by men against women(obviously, the specifics of what they experience is extremely rare, and the details are hard to relate to. But the notion that some people, if not stopped, are simply going to keep hurting any female they can, really resonates). Ultimately, it could go even further. And it definitely would have been able to go deeper, if not for the trusted MCU formula demanding frequent action scenes. Thankfully, immensely talented director Cate Shortland does what she can (and that\'s a lot) to keep those scenes as intense and impactful as possible, by keeping the camera close, letting us feel every blow. There are some issues with the pacing and editing, that are most likely down to the movie not being completely done shooting before Corona restrictions were put in place, and a reluctance by the studio to postpone release until those rules were lifted. A decision which, honestly, is completely understandable. I won\'t spend long talking about Taskmaster, other than to say that, given what they clearly wanted to do there, they should simply have come up with a new character, or picked one that actually suited their needs, since now, they have frustrated(when that wasn\'t necessary or intentional at all) many who hoped for a more direct interpretation, and now merely distracts from a powerful and carefully thought-out depiction(as far as the ideas that this is exploring, they got it 100-percent spot-on).A little visible blood, and lasting wounds, push the PG-13 rating. I recommend this to any fan of Scarlett, her depiction of the role, of spy thrillers, and of comic book adaptations. 7/10.', 'While being pursued by Ross after the events of Civil War, Natasha finds herself embroiled in a plot against the Red Room Widow programme from which she defected to SHIELD. This involves her getting re-entangled with the sleeper cell ""family"" with whom she spent her childhood in rural Ohio.ScarJo\'s long-awaited solo outing becomes the most atypical MCU movie of all, and I suspect it will disappoint a lot of people for reasons I will get to.The extensive delay in its appearance due to Covid (and its divided delivery between cinemas and Disney streaming) hasn\'t helped. But the big thing (to me, at least) is that it doesn\'t really feel like a MCU movie. I know that sounds improbable when you consider the mixed bag making up the couple of dozen movies so far, but this one felt like a spy movie dark in tone which, despite a moderate amount of MCU namedropping, was more Bond/Bourne than Marvel.The story was fine, and we found out more about Natasha\'s origin (although we didn\'t learn much about Budapest). ScarJo was fine and Florence Pugh was outstanding as her ""sister"" Yelena: the chemistry between them was wonderful. Rachel Weisz, never a favourite of mine, was good, too.David Harbour as Red Guardian was merely OK, and the wonderful Ray Winstone disappointed. I got the impression hardly bothered - one for the pension fund, Ray. And Olga Kurylenko was wasted.Plus there were a lot of directorial choices which I thought could have been better, especially the use of handheld shots where less wobble would have been welcome. And I watched it in 3D on a screen on which, even without glasses, it was conspicuously darker than the trailer had been.The action was good and the post-credits scene pleased. This is a good, but flawed, film, and I think it\'s biggest problem is likely to be that what it delivers, despite its quality, is likely to fail to match the expectations of its audience.', 'After the delay for it to be released, I booked a ticket to see the film in Manchester at the Vue IMAX (the second largest screen in Europe) Printworks on the opening day. As the days got near,I realised that due to the screening time,I would miss seeing the England V Denmark match at the 2020 Euro\'s!Having paid for the ticket ages ago,and interested in opening this new chapter of the MCU, I crossed my fingers that England would win, (well done lads!) and got set to at last met the widow.View on the film:Waiting in the wings since her head-turning entrance in Iron Man 2 (2010-also reviewed), Scarlett Johansson visibly displays delight in finally presenting Black Widow in her own solo film, with Johansson firing the MCU quips and performing the action scenes with a live-wire enthusiastic edge, which Johansson dual-welds with fractured emotions from the traumatic experience of the Red Room where she was forced to become a spy/assassin,and the lingering horror from seeing her family torn apart.Whilst Ray Winstone brings unintended (?) Comedy into proceedings thanks to his boo-hiss Russian baddie coming from the Sean Connery School of Accents, David Harbour soars like a Rocketeer as he spreads one-liners across the sky. Squeezing into the dusty, disused for 20 years costume of the Red Guardian, Harbour unleashes the comedy with a gruff warmth becoming revealed in the family reunion.Loaded with the same assassin skills as her sister, Florence Pugh makes Yelena stand out by hitting the physical comedy with a real glee that gently mocks the action moves of her sister, whilst at the same time, Pugh brings out a vulnerability to Yelena\'s fear of losing her family whilst inside the Red Room.Showing Black Widow at the beginning watching the 007 flick Moonraker on TV, (both have a sky diving sequence, and their baddies share a lair which hovers above Earth) director Cate Shortland & cinematographer Gabriel Beristain hint about what they later unleash in the explosive final set-pieces, which crunches long panning shots spinning along the shiny CGI of the Sci-Fi Red Room,with Spy thrills of brutal hand to hand combat sequences between Black Widow and silent assassin Taskmaster.Reuniting them after two decades apart, Shortland wonderfully captures the fragile re-building of the family bond with long wide-shots sitting in on Black Widow round the family table healing wounds that have been left open for years.An executive producer on the film, Johansson revealed that she wanted the movie ""To comment on... this incredible movement of women supporting other women, and coming through these shared experiences of trauma on the other side by really coming forward and supporting one another.""Whilst featuring a killer post-credit twist that links to the MCU, the screenplay by Eric Pearson, Jac Schaeffer and Ned Benson place the emphasis on Black Widow heroically fighting through her experiences of trauma from when the opportunity to choose was destroyed in childhood, via now battling to support other women who have been traumatized in the Red Room, and with family by her side, Black Widow fights tooth and nail, in order to give other women the chance of a free choice.', ""So finally movies are back in the cinema and this one was one of the first to watch. An Avengers spin-off.It's nice to see how Black Widow was created but after a while it became a bit too much of blah blah but towards the end it do picks up the action again.The effects are stunning and the fight scene's are spectacular too but as said, the story itself has it flows. And maybe some reviews are true, it's more about her sister to be honest.Still a decent Marvel flick but not the best one.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 5/5 Story 2,5/5 Comedy 0/5."", ""There are some people complaining about the M-She-U and how they messed Black Widow up and so on. They are exaggerating. Black Widow is just an average Marvel film with the same level of logic, subtlety and action as, say, Captain America. Meaning it isn't smart or great, but it is entertaining.The problem with the film is that it uses this theme about Russian sleeper agents, so they get Scarlett Johansson, Florence Pugh, Rachel Weisz and David Harbour to play them and speaking with awful Russian accents. OK, you will say, they had to have A-listed actors to play in a Marvel film, not Russians, but they had The Americans as a blueprint on how to make this work and they did not care. You do know that sleeper agents don't speak with an accent, right?And there was another issue, that of Florence Pugh stealing the show, even if her character was pretty inconsistent and not having her title the film. Faking a dull Balkan fatalism in everything she did, and with a deadpan sense of humor, she kind of showed us what probably Wanda should have behaved like. Finally, Olga Kurylenko. She got me excited with her character and being introduced in the Marvel universe. Yet in this film she had like one line of dialogue. More to come, I am sure, but still.The future of this storyline seems to be an all female New Hydra vs New Shield thing, like a mini Civil War. I just hope that in it males won't be either fully supportive guys in the friend zone, psychopaths, comical relief or fully covered in uniforms and masks as henchmen."", 'You both have killed so many people. Your ledgers must be dripping, just gushing red. I couldn\'t be more proud of you.\' Alexei Shostakov (David Harbour): to Natasha and YelenaWhat helps me through the bombs and kicks of super-hero films is the consistent ""family"" theme. It may be whole families or individual members looking for parents or siblings. In Black Widow, Natasha (Scarlett Johannson) is seeking reconciliation with her sister and her parents. BW frames the entire adventure around the family dynamic. Notwithstanding the combative family of Avenger superheroes themselves, this version brings home the importance of real home.Although Black Widow is historically placed between Captain America: Civil War and Avengers: Infinity War, it has its own surfeit of mano-mano fighting and explosions. When the dust settles, Natasha joins forces with her sister, Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh) to find her mother, Melina (Rachel Weisz), and father, Alexei (David Harbour). Things are not as they seem when the daughters do catch up to join forces after some rocky initial actions.The first forty minutes of the family\'s escape from their idyllic Ohio home are as exciting an opener as you will likely see this summer. Then, as the formula demands, there is a Bond-like megalomaniac, Dreykov (Ray Winstone), whom the girls will target as he dominates other ""widows"" around the world with chemically-induced mind control.Twenty-one years later, Natasha escapes a SWAT team to Norway, then briefly rejoining Yelena in Budapest before they both try to evade an armored vehicle and the menacing Dreykov soldiers who mimic the fighting techniques of their prey-even Avengers.The vials of antidote Yelena steals were designed by Dreykov to erase free will of the world\'s widows-a McGuffin-like device that is lost amid the chaos. The nice touch is that the sisters not only can knock off this world enemy, but they can also liberate strong young women, a gentle way of introducing the feminist motif without beating the audience with it. After quite capable director Cate Shortland and writer Eric Pearson allow the sisters to reconcile, watch for Yelena mocking Natasha\'s balletic hair-toss pose. Not all the impact of the heroic epic is explosions.Johansson and Pugh are in the Butch Cassady tradition of buddy bonding, a characterizing that promises future Avengers\' sagas to be more humane and endearing. BW is solid summer fun either at the theater or on Disney+.', '""As per Marvel\'s standard (and deep pockets), BLACK WIDOW\'s extravagant FX is consistently engaging if singularity never emerges (every time when the dust settles, it leaves an ecocide no one cares), crisply coordinated action sequences are slick in motion but uneventful in impact, Natasha is not superhuman, still she can defy gravity, survive grievous car crushes and take haymakers without batting her eyelids, blood at the corner of her mouth is the maximal damage violence can incur to meet our eyes. In the main, BLACK WIDOW is a predictable joyride of thrills and chills, but most crucially, it contests the male dominance of adrenaline driven entertainment, with a preponderance of women in action, it sets an eloquence case no sane person can confute.""read my full review on my blog: Cinema Omnivore, thanks.', ""'Black Widow (2021)' is one of the weaker entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's actually rather forgettable, to be honest. Set after the events of 'Captain America: Civil War (2016)', the film follows its eponymous hero as she teams up with her long-lost sister to take down the people in charge of the 'red room', the brain-washing facility that Natasha herself was forced into as a child. The picture starts out feeling quite different to the other entries in its franchise, with a somewhat dark tone and a 'Bourne'-esque vibe. Eventually, though, it deteriorates into the same formulaic sort of thing we've seen countless times from Marvel Studios, with big CGI set-pieces and forced-in humour. The comedy often clashes with the flick's tone and is, frankly, sometimes quite annoying, whereas the action is far too infrequent and intangible to be fully satisfying. Ray Winston's villain is also the most bland and uninteresting of any baddie in the MCU and, yes, that even includes Malekith the dark elf from 'Thor: The Dark World (2011)'. The film isn't bad, don't get me wrong. There are a few entertaining action scenes, the performances are all on point and the story is generally engaging. It just feels like a pretty passive experience, though. It isn't massively compelling and quite a few of its plot points fall totally flat. Still, it's enjoyable enough to be worth a watch once. However, I can't see myself revisiting it any time soon and, because of where it falls in the MCU's chronology, I don't think I really need to. 6/10."", ""I had a good time with this movie. I was invested throughout. I loved the characters, especially the new additions of Yelena and Alexei. The characters have great chemistry. And I laughed a lot.Florence Pugh and David Harbour rock in this movie. Florence Pugh continues to impress me. Her acting skills are top notch (see Midsommar) and i already knew she could kick butt (see Fighting with My Family). There are a couple of acting moments she has where I was like, damn. And David Harbour plays his role amazingly. So funny. Likeable in an unlikeable way, if that makes sense.There are two things this movie almost does that could have made it amazing. One is to go for a darker tone. And I don't mean like the ominous feeling of Infinity War. But a genuinely dark tone that would work perfectly with the dark thematic background of the main character. And the start of the movie made me think they were going that route. It was pretty messed up. But the rest of the movie felt exactly like the template MCU movie. I love that template, but it would have been cool to see something different here.The second thing that could have made it stand out is the musical score. I've complained so many times that the weakest part of the MCU is the music. There are a few scores I like, but most are unimpactful. The new MCU shows have stepped it up (Wandavision, Falcon Winty, and especially Loki).When black widow started, I loved the musical score. It was immediately impactful and elevated the prologue. It gave the movie character. And then the credits show that it's composed by Lorne Balfe, who has become one of my favorite composers. But as usual in the MCU, the music is kept mostly in the background and has very little impact on the scenes. Think of the music played during the final fight in Civil War or during the funeral scene in Thor 2. The music owns me. And it could have in black widow. But I barely noticed it for the rest of the movie.The action is pretty awesome. A couple of moments in the fight scenes were unclear, but it was mostly well-done. Overall I had a great time with this movie, and I liked it even more the second time. (2 viewings, opening night 7/8/2021, 12/1/2021)"", 'When I wanted them to make a stand-alone Black Widow movie all the way back to her premiering in the lackluster Iron Man 2, I kinda wanted it when she was alive. But I guess going back in time is what the MCU does best now.(Just a clarification, that\'s not a spoiler for this movie. It\'s just part of the MCU that she passes in Avengers: Endgame and that\'s acknowledged here.)To put my feeling for the MCU in perspective, none of the 24 Avenger movies fall into my top 20 action movies of all time. Not that they were bad, plenty of them were good to great. It\'s just, most of them are comedies first and action/comic book movies second...or third. Such in the case of both Iron Man 3 and Thor: Ragnarok. Both were 80% comedies with a smidge of action.Mercifully, Black Widow is less of a comedy, although the one running gag (Posing) was funny and creative and a few other jokes landed. Not terribly funny, but luckily, this isn\'t meant to be funny. Nope, in this case: it\'s 80% drama and 20% action.Don\'t get me wrong; 2 of the 3-4 action scenes were good, the now-overused, yet still fun climax being the best, but the action was so few and far in-between and sadly, I just didn\'t connect with the ""drama"" and ""sad-scenes"" very well. I never felt bad for these people, even when kids were involved. Maybe it\'s because the movie was SO COLD, little heart could be felt.After a solid cold opening showing our infamous Natasha Romanoff, aka The Title Character, as a kid about to become said Title Character, we fast-forward to her well-established as the Black Widow. Well, one of them, anyways. There we see her go on a very basic and simple mission with her estranged sister and family.Oh, and they probably mentioned the word ""Avengers"" more times in this movie and her connection to them than all 4 actual Avenger movies combined.My biggest problem with this movie is that I wanted to see either A: An Origin Story of her trials and tribulations of becoming my 2nd favorite Avenger behind Captain Steve Rogers or B: she\'s already Black Widow and she smartly kicks as much ass as she\'s done with every other appearance of hers in the MCU. Well, I did get about 7 minutes of that origin story and about 10 minutes of her actually being the kick-ass super-spy we all love. Those 10 minutes are the last 10 minutes of the movie. The rest of the movie, and here\'s the problem, SHE IS BLACK WIDOW throughout the movie, sans those original 7 minutes in the cold-open. So...why do they make her so oh-hum throughout? She\'s not learning to become Black Widow; she\'s been that way since the opening credits. We just finally get her bad-assery in the closing and by then I was incredibly bored with so many overly dramatic and predictable, drawn-out scenes.But, that was my biggest issue. In truth, it wasn\'t that bad of the movie, even though a ton of it was generic action scenes or family drama never reaching tension. I did enjoy Scarlett, as always, but here she just felt like Sean Connery coming back for Never Say Never Again. Like this was just a paycheck for her.While it\'s a mild recommendation, it\'s not at all necessary to see this movie in connection with the others except for the weak-post credit scene (all the way at the end of the 20 minutes of credits.) It felt so much like a mid-season storyline/couple of episodes of a TV season - never as great as the first 2 episodes and definitely less fun/excitement as the season finale\'s last few episodes. Think of it as episode 4-6 of a 9-part TV season.***Final Thoughts: Here\'s my updated ranking of all the MCU movies with stars, Best to WORST:1 Marvel\'s The Avengers (4½/5 Stars.) 2 Captain America: The First Avenger (4½/5 Stars.) 3 Guardians of the Galaxy (4½/5 Stars.) 4 Avengers: Infinity War (4½/5 Stars.) 5 Iron Man (4/5 Stars.) 6 Captain America: The Winter Soldier (4/5 Stars.) 7 Spider-Man: Far From Home (4/5 Stars.) 8 Captain America: Civil War (3½/5 Stars.) 9 Thor: Ragnarok (3½/5 Stars.) 10 Avengers: Endgame (3½/5 Stars.) 11 Doctor Strange (3/5 Stars.) 12 Ant-Man (3/5 Stars.) 13 Ant-Man and the Wasp (3/5 Stars.) 14 Black Panther (3/5 Stars.) 15 The Incredible Hulk (3/5 Stars.) 16 Iron Man 3 (3/5 Stars.) 17 Black Widow (2½/5 Stars.) 18 Thor: The Dark World (2½/5 Stars.) 19 Avengers: Age of Ultron (2½/5 Stars.) 20 Spider-Man: Homecoming (2½/5 Stars.) 21 Iron Man 2 (2/5 Stars.) 22 Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2/5 Stars.) 23 Captain Marvel (2/5 Stars.) 24 Thor (2/5 Stars.)', ""If you're expecting a superhero movie, well, this isn't one. It's basically a distaff James Bond with more childhood trauma, but for that it's generally good.Like a lot of MCU movies, Black Widow assumes you've watched all the other movies and remember who everyone is. It seems to also assume we'll understand the little story it tells in the credits, which is more impressionistic than informative. I was pretty much at a loss for the first 1/2 hour.At first this movie felt like I'd already seen it. There's a fight scene on a bridge that I could have sworn I'd already seen, even though the movie just came out, and it really took a while before that sense of Deja Vu ended.At first I wasn't sure if I wanted to keep going, but once the excellent Florence Pugh shows up as the protagonist's sister and the movie starts delving into the nature of family and some moral grey zones things get more interesting. And the final half hour of explosions and twists and hurtling through the sky is impressively action-y, even if no one has x-ray vision.While this movie's insistence on not explaining things to non-MCU fanatics (a practice it returns to in a final coda) and some rote early scenes keep this from being as good as it could have been, overall this is an entertaining movie. Recommended."", ""Black Widow is about 7-8 years overdue as this should've happened post-winter soldier era MCU to me however, that doesn't diminish this film as a solid entry in a 25+ film saga and certainly one Scarlett Johansson deserved as a proper send off. Funny, action packed when it needs to be, and rewatchable Black Widow made it's mark on the genre this summer. I wish it would've done better at the box office.8.7/10."", ""After all these years, Black Widow finally gets her own standalone movie and... it's okay. I actually found Florence Pugh, David Harbour, and Rachel Weisz to be entertaining additions, but the story felt cobbled together and it was riddled with plot holes. I know Natasha is a very skilled assassin, for instance, but she's almost invulnerable in this. It probably would have been better to give Black Widow her solo film a year or two after Iron Man 2 came out."", 'In 1995, young Natasha Romanoff and Yelena Belova are whisked away by their surrogate parents, Alexei Shostakov, originally Russia\'s Captain America known as the Red Guardian, and former Black Widow Melina Vostokoff from their home in Ohio. As their mission ends, Romanoff and Belova are put through the Red Room for further training.In 2016, following the battle between the Avengers at Leipzig/Halle Airport,[N 1] Romanoff is a fugitive from the government for violating the Sokovia Accords. She escapes from U.S. Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross and flees to a safehouse in Norway where she reunites with her contact Rick Mason. Elsewhere, Belova is still working for the Red Room where she kills a former Black Widow, only to come in contact with a substance called Red Dust that removes the Red Room\'s control of her. She sends the antidote to Romanoff\'s safehouse in the hopes that she will return to help her.As Romanoff unknowingly drives off with the antidote, she is attacked by Taskmaster, who is after the Red Dust. Romanoff manages to evade Taskmaster and learns that the Dust came from Belova. The two reunite in Budapest, but are then attacked by Black Widows. While escaping, Romanoff learns the Red Room is still active and that its leader, Dreykov, is still alive. In order for her to join S.H.I.E.L.D., her mission was to kill Dreykov. After detonating a building with him and his young daughter Antonia in it (an act that has haunted her), both were presumed dead. Romanoff and Belova evade Taskmaster and meet back up with Mason who supplies them an aircraft.Romanoff and Belova break Shostakov out of prison to learn where Dreykov is and he tells them that they need to speak with Vostokoff who has been living on a farm using mind control on pigs. Belova reveals that while they were not a real family, she still wanted to believe that they were so, while Shostakov and Vostokoff admit that they too wished they were a real family. Vostokoff gives away their location to Dreykov whose agents arrive and take them away to the Red Room, which is located on an aerial base.As Dreykov congratulates Vostokoff on finding them, it is revealed that Vostokoff and Romanoff used face mask technology to switch places at the farm, having planned their own capture. Romanoff learns that Taskmaster is Antonia, who had suffered damage so severe that Dreykov was forced to put a chip in her head to help her, turning her into the perfect soldier. Romanoff also discovers that she cannot harm Dreykov due to a pheromone lock he installed in every Widow, and that he has been controlling Widows all around the world via his control desk. After goading Dreykov into punching her in the face, Romanoff intentionally severs a nerve in her nasal passage to negate the pheromone and allow herself to attack Dreykov.Vostokoff attempts to take out the ship\'s engine while Shostakov battles Antonia and Belova searches for the other Widows who are sent to protect Dreykov. Dreykov escapes as the Widows gang up on Romanoff, but Belova creates a Red Dust bomb that releases the Widows from mind control. Romanoff gets into the control desk and releases the other Widows worldwide just as the ship begins to explode and fall. Vostokoff and Shostakov are forced to escape the ship via aircraft just as Belova takes out Dreykov\'s escape ship, killing him.Romanoff gives Belova a parachute as she and Antonia have one final battle through the sky before safely landing on the ground. Romanoff uses the last vial of Red Dust on Antonia, freeing her from servitude. The rest of the Widows arrive as Belova, Vostokoff, and Shostakov say goodbye to Romanoff, with Belova giving her her vest to remember her by.

I was hyped for the movie since the first teaser and the movie actually exceedes my expectations. Marvel has been showing its MARVELous magic since Ironman, and Shang-Chi is another diamond in the crown. After the end of MCU's phase 3, fans were eagerly waiting for a big movie. Black Widow was not up to the mark and Eternals also disappointed majority of fans, but Chang-Chi filled their gap. The action scenes were fresh and engaging. Martial arts combined with chinese mythological powers makes these action scenes more interesting. Character arc and story building were satisfying. They were not rushed or slow paced. Whole movie was engaging till the end. I would love to see another movie of this franchise."", 'I\'ll be honest - Marvel movies are not in my top 20 or even 50 but within the Marvel ""Universe"" I would say that Shang-Chi is in my top 5. I know, it\'s blasphemy and all that but think about it - is it better than Iron Man? I would admit yes - it\'s origin story is arguably better, and it\'s characters are a lot deeper. The Mandarin is a conflicted man, with evil but good as well, like real life. Is this movie better than The Avengers or Ragnarok or Infinity Wars? Hard to say, which means it\'s right up there with the best (of Marvel) in my opinion.Plus, I\'m a sucker for Chinese movies with the Chinese language being spoken - 1 of my favourite of all times, if not my absolute favourite, is of course \'Hero.\' The Chinese language and the artistry of it\'s culture are magnificent.All in all, well done Marvel, director Destin, and all those who worked to make this movie a reality. This is not just your average summer action movie; it\'s close to being a Masterpiece. And the humour is pretty swell too!Cheers.', '(Spoilers) Down pretty far on the Marvel list, the writers and director of Shang-Chi kinda miss the mark. The movie is a snooze fest for the first hour and its tone is all over the place. The end of the movie was visually interesting but honestly borrowed from Pacific Rim/Godzilla. Leading up to that the drive in the story is non-sensical - the father is being called to by his wife to bring his family together? No, as time passes, this is a weak motivation. The sound on quality was poor from dialog to music - I had to keep upping the volume for dialog and lowering for soundtrack/interlude. Humor is stunted and meh. Fairly disappointing, especially compared to other Marvel movies.', 'I got to admit I wasn\'t particularly blown away by anything in the movie.. I might even say ""I was bored"" by it.Don\'t get me wrong.. it IS a spectacle! The action is great. The locations are nice, costume design, sound design, etc. But it is overall a soft release not worth seeing in theaters.. specially as a follow-up to what Endgame was.The biggest problem for me, is how the underwritten lead has muddled personality (for reasons covered in the story) devoid of charm, personality or good dialogue.The next issue is the humor, which didn\'t land for me.. Not once. The supporting lead Awkwafina isn\'t her normal ""loud"" self that\'s supposed to be funny every time she opens her mouth. Her role is very supportive and a little dramatic. And while I questioned myself why was she even there for, it doesn\'t ultimately matter. She is another forgettable character that is given more importance than the role deserves.Finally, the third act is weak. There\'s a balancing problem with stakes. You can\'t feel tension or weight to any action. And there\'s a lot of superficial ""I can\'t do it"" until they can.In the end, this feels like a very safe plot, written in a way to appeal to china (considering how the Mandarin is portrayed), that ends up appealing to no one specific. Certainly doesn\'t feel like a Marvel movie.. but it was bound to happen if we are to be introduced to different aspects of the narrative. But it also doesn\'t feel like a comic book. It\'s more generic than that.', ""6/10 - I seem to be the only one to not be marveling at the latest Marvel Studios offering, but while this movie is technically sound (visual effects, stunt work, sound, cinematography, you name it), I found it to be mostly a rehash of things I've seen before (maybe I'm just getting tired of all these superhero movies)"", 'Finally!

But the movie is much more lively. Enjoyed every moment. And also very engaging from start to finish. A kinda Cute-Action movie with some fun stuff!This is the first movie that focuses more on martial arts than Marvel's superpower thing. Love to see a mix of Marvel's MASTER-LEVEL-CGI with Martial art. Kung-Fu with this kind of visual effect! Marvel nailed it again.I've always loved Marvel's casting. Katy is too perfect for her role. Loved her chemistry with Shaun. Also laughed out loud at her childish stuffs.Just one thing, not a big deal, the action scene of 'Dragon Riding' doesn't fit into the usual Marvel movie.

52,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Eternals,9032400,"['The Eternals are immortals created to eliminate the destructive Deviants. 7000 years ago, ten Eternals were sent to Earth. They were able to eliminate the last Deviant 500 years ago and have been waiting to go home ever since.This is a reach for the MCU franchise. I like the audacity but there are issues with the execution. I do like the style and the visual but I find the characters hard to connect with. They are god-like creatures trying to pass as humans. There is something compelling in that but the characters never fully find their human level. There is barrier to these characters that the film is unable to breach. In addition, Angelina Jolie is too distracting in this role. I like Gemma Chan but maybe she should play Thena. Sersi needs an ingenue with star power. In the end, this is a tougher premise to execute than most and the film struggles to give it a human scale.', 'Eternals comes across as a muddled standalone MCU film. There are four credited writers.The Eternals are immortal beings with superpowers. They came to Earth 7,000 years ago to kill the predatory Deviants, they are dragon like monsters.The Eternals were created by Celestial creator Arishem. They all have different powers and abilities. Since then they have been shaping civilisation on Earth.In modern day London. Eternal Sersi (Gemma Chan) comes across a Deviant attack, the first in hundreds of years.Sersi along with other Eternals, Ikaris (Richard Madden) and Sprite go to South Dakota to find their leader, Ajak (Salma Hayek) has been killed.They reunite with the rest of the Eternals to fight the Deviants who seem to have evolved. Instead they learn their true purpose on Earth.The first part of the film has lots of exposition. I doubt a lot of the audience would be aware of the Eternals. Some of it is wrapped up in Greek mythology.There seems to be a more adult approach by Marvel here. There is even a love scene and a gay kiss. Director Chloé Zhao won a best Director Oscar by the time the film was released.Adult could also mean more po faced. The character of Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani) is on hand for comic relief. The movie also has the chutzpah to mention a couple of DC heroes including Superman.This might be as the film also explores the dark side of having superpowers.Eternals was a creative risk for Marvel. A break from the formula but not a radical one. Even then it has proved divisive with the audience.It is too long, the acting is wooden. Too many of the characters lacked charisma. Some of the dialogue was hackneyed.Still there was lot that was enjoyable, it dazzled in parts with a lot of money spent on special effects.', 'Marvel is unable to top ""Endgame"" and clearly needs new direction. So they created another superhero group that lives at the same time of the Marvel characters but don\'t associate with them. The Eternals were created to protect mankind from the Deviants and in the end (plot spoiler) must allow the Celestial Tiamut destroy the Earth so he can create other worlds and people.The film provides us with a corundum. Save the earth and prevent new lives from happening or let the Earth. The film hints that you can gut the sound an listen to it while playing \'Dark Side of the Moon"" on loop. And 2001 called. They want their monolith back. Gilgamesh (Don Lee) is poorly done. Gilgamesh represented a solar deity. He had long hair.Guide: No swearing or nudity. Brief sex scene.', ""I've read several critical reviews applauding this film, however having sat through it twice I have to point out that this is a very poor film.Almost two and a half hours long, and every single minute of this film was an effort. How on Earth did they think this would appeal?It's a lifeless watch, it rambles along at a torturous pace, and sadly half the cast seem totally disinterested, giving very wooden performances.Special effects vary, some look good, some look very poor, when you look at the budget this film had, it should have looked flawless, it doesn't.I love Gemma Chan and Richard Madden, but neither of them look totally at home here, I only hope this turkey of a movie doesn't halt either career.I don't think a second will follow somehow.Awful sadly, I did give it a second watch to be sure, but there you are, it's a shocker, 3/10."", 'The most inclusive movie of the MCU yet - and while I didn\'t count, probably after the first Captain America movie, the first that has an overall serious tone to it. That being said, there is still a lot of humor in it. Especially Kumal and his ... ""sidekick"" cover most of the jokes. Which may be the reason he is AWOL at a certain point in time (you\'ll know which moment that is) - you can hold that against the movie or just go with the flow.Which is true for the inclusiveness - and I am not even talking about the very first sex scene of the MCU. Don\'t get too excited (or upset), it is quite tame, but might still be reason for kids to be asking some questions (they are just cuddling like we do - could be a possible answer I reckon). You also have the inclusion of a gay character - the movie does not make a big deal out of it. You may when you see a tender male on male kiss. Hopefully you are not someone offended by such things and open minded.And all these things have nothing to do with any ""superhero"" powers (I reckon you can and probably most will call the Eternals superheroes) ... so the movie is quite packed. So much acting talent in front of the camera, so much creative and technical wizardry behind the camera. So there is a point to be made that this could have easily been a Disney Plus show. Who knows, maybe there will be an Eternals inspired Disney Plus show. Could be after the movie plays or in between the arrival of the Eternals and ""Present Day"" (I always wonder what that must look like decades after this was made - anyway).There are certain elements that can be considered cliche, but that would be quite the nitpicking, if you went down that road. Chloe Zhao really held her own and was able to reign in everyone and make a really good movie. Especially on a big screen this will impress you (like on an Imax screen). Because it is different in many ways, this may be viewed more favorably in the future with more context or different expectations.We\'re still early on in Phase 4 and some may have a better understanding or can guess where the MCU might be heading next. I am talking about fans, I am quite certain Kevin Feige and some others do know of course. At least vaguely. 2,5 hours long and never felt boring or too much. If anything it felt like too little. For what it is (ensemble), it is really well made and condensed.Yes there are logic issues (where were they all this time? Why didn\'t they appear earlier and so forth?) ... they are adressed of course, but would not really withstand a smell test. But if you are invested in the MCU, the question is: do you really mind? Also this can be seen and watched without any knowledge of anything that came before ... but as always it is way better enjoyed if you have seen the things that came before.Interestingly enough characters from the DC (universe) are being mentioned, like Batmans Alfred or even Superman. So there does not seem to be a mean spirited thought behind that. More like an acknowledgment and a nod to the other universe, that has created so many great stories and characters too. And an admission, but also acknowledgment to the audience and their feelings and intelligence. There is not a void - this could be our universe ... maybe a parallel universe that works that way ... wouldn\'t that be a great thought/thing to have? And who are we to say that it isn\'t possible? With Spiderman coming up next - the door will be smashed rather than kicked in - and I am really looking forward to that one - hoping to keep the ""spoilers"" far away from myself. Until then, don\'t forget: there are two bonus scenes (mid and after credit), like with most MCU movies.', ""Even with it's epic sweep of time and space, this film didn't connect with me. We're introduced to Eternals Ikaris (Richard Madden) and Sersi (Gemma Chan) in 5000 BC Mesopotamia, obviously in love with each other, and they get married in 400 AD during the Gupta Empire. Why the long wait? Similarly, Ajak (Salma Hayek) dies during the 400 AD sequence, but Gilgamesh (Ma Dong-seok) doesn't find out about it until the present day in Mumbai. Really?? It's stuff like that, that take me right out of the story with it's distracting effect on what's happening. But wait a minute... In present day Iraq, Ikaris intends to protect the Emergence, and kills Ajak? What am I missing here? I thought Ajak was already dead for about sixteen hundred years, and there was no explanation for it. Fortunately there was some humor interjected into the picture with the characters of Kingo (Kumail Nanjiani) and the single non-Eternal human Karun (Harish Patel), who never met a camera he didn't like. For me, Karun had the best lines in the picture. As for the story, you could follow it okay if you paid attention, but after a while it just got too tedious for this viewer. And at two and a half hours, it gets a little antsy to sit through completely from start to finish. You might even say, it felt eternal."", 'Another year, another Marvel Studios superhero movie, right? Well, so it would seem. I had only vaguely heard about ""Eternals"" prior to sitting down to watch it. But then again, superhero movies isn\'t exactly my primary go-to-movie choice. But yeah, I do watch them if given the chance, as Marvel Studios does churn out movies that are fun enough if for nothing else then for the amazing CGI.And that was the case with the 2021 movie ""Eternals"" from writers Chloé Zhao, Patrick Burleigh, Ryan Firpo and Kaz Firpo. This movie was all flash and bang and no proper contents. It was all essentially just pointless eye-candy.For me, then we are talking about a swing and a miss for Marvel Studios with the 2021 superhero movie ""Eternals"". When the movie ended, I was left with an overwhelming sensation of \'what did I just waste two and a half hours on watching?\'. And I was also left with a sense of none of the characters portrayed in the story had any significance or backstory. You might as well replace them with mannequins and still end up with the same movie result.You would assume that with a cast ensemble that included the likes of Gemma Chan, Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Kit Harington and Lauren Ridloff among others, that you would be in for a stellar movie experience. But nay, director Chloé Zhao didn\'t rise to the occasion to deliver a wholesome and entertaining superhero movie. Nope, this was a lukewarm movie at best.The total absence of properly written characters and character development throughout the two and a half hours of runtime was just atrocious to witness. And it totally turned the movie into a shallow experience. Yet, I managed to sit through it, but believe you me, this is not a movie that I will ever be returning to watch a second time. There were so many characters to keep track off, yet none of them had any properly written backstory, character traits, personalities or anything, so they just sort of blended into one singular faceless mass. And hence, I didn\'t care one bit about any of the hero characters, because they were about as interesting as mannequins.""Eternals"" was pure and simply just eye-candy in term of entertainment value. The storyline would have been more interesting if the story had interesting characters, subplots, etc., but there was no such thing going on here.Sure, I am by no account a fan of the superhero genre, but watch the movie regardless, but ""Eternals"" was definitely among the top contenders for being among the most pointless and boring of superhero movies.My rating of ""Eternals"" lands on a three out of ten stars.', 'The visuals of ""Eternals"" are spectacular. They look very real and very stylish. I also applaud the film for the diversity of the cast. However, the build up of the film is just too slow and too long, and I lost most of my interest and concentration when the final showdown begins. In addition, the one liner jokes are a little out of place and quite contrived. It is still an entertaining film, but probably not as great as the recent Marvel films.', 'I\'m not going to give a long winded review though the movie was long. ""Eternal"" was the runtime. There were parts that were good and parts that weren\'t. One of the biggest issues is that a movie of this nature presents more questions than it answers. The very existence of eternal beings existing on planet Earth, sent there by their creator in order to protect human life from Deviants, begs a lot of questions. And the more they strayed from their prime directive, the more questions they presented. The eternals were human in every aspect with the exception of their powers and their lifespan. The fact that such humanlike and very fallible beings (as in not entirely obedient) were sent to protect humans is just a start of the questions.""Eternals"" was unnecessarily long. There were plenty of scenes that could\'ve been left on the cutting room floor. Marvel bit off a lot with this metaphysical, beginning of creation movie. It was very emotional and slow at many points. Even the comic relief failed to garner the laughs it intended. But, there was applause in the theater after it was over. Honestly, I don\'t know if that was based upon how good the movie was or simply MCU diehards paying their obligatory tribute.', ""EternalsSo there are Celestials, God-like beings. Arishem, one of them, allocates a bunch of Eternals (fairly God-like but not quite) to Earth, 7,000 years ago, to protect mankind from Deviants (unexplained monsters). This is their only job: they are not to interfere in human affairs. They wipe the Deviants out and then go their seperate ways, waiting to be recalled to their home planet. Then a Deviant appears...I enjoyed this and the eye candy is splendid, the action is beautifully choreographed. But it is one of the weaker offerings, and here is why.There are too many new characters and you don't get the chance to know them. This means you don't get emotionally invested in them. Yes, you care about whether xyz global crisis happens, but you don't really care about the relationships between the Eternals. A number of character-based subplots are introduced but never really go anywhere. The thing about the MCU is that you got to genuinely care about each character, which is why the deaths in Avengers 3 and 4 were so devastating. That is not the case here.Also, it is longer than it needs to be, to no purpose, and although the story is simple, it is unnecessarily complicated in the telling.Again, I enjoyed it, but it is probably 2nd or 3rd from the bottom of my list. It is competently - skilfully, even - assembled, but it has little heart."", ""Again a lot of negative reviews on here. Negative reviews from people that will never be satisfied, whatever movie you make they will always bash it down. The funniest of them all is from a reviewer rating it with three stars. He watched it twice! Is that not ridiculous? Watching a movie that you score that low twice? I only watch movies that I really liked twice and Eternals is going to be one of them. The story is interesting, the CGI's stunning, the acting more than decent (but that's absolutely normal when you see the great cast it has). There's clearly going to be a sequel, one that I will watch for sure. I just hope those negative people will skip that one, as it's going to be of the same level. So if you for some obscure reason didn't like Eternals just do us a favor and skip that one and let the Marvel fans enjoy their movies."", ""And then magic happened, Eternals on Disney streaming. Another entry in the Marvel world. And have seen enough trailers I was ready for it, it looked great but......after one hour I turned this off. On part of the effects it all looked great but what the hell about the story and characters. It's all one boring mess. Nothing happens and when things happens I was thinking, okay, is this it? Fighting against CGI creatures. Not that I have a thing against CGI creatures but it was all lame.The beginning was okay with the history of the world but then it just became one boring love story and as one said, a lifeless flick.How much I tried, It won't stick for eternal in my mind.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 4/5 Story 2/5 Comedy 0/5."", 'Not the greatest ""Marvel"" movie fan yet I gave ""Eternals"" a try even though never really hearing about it or reading the comics, and was not real impressed as the movie went back and fourth thru the ages and time as the group of Eternals were always fighting evil and the movie was a showcase of love and family like feel. It was an eye candy watch for seeing the hot and sexy Gemma Chan and Salma Hayek as immortals Sersi and Ajak as both were healers and watchers of the group. Overall my interest came and went the film for one was to long and drawn out as the message could have been shorter. Still I guess a watch if your a Marvel movie fan, and the look of Gemma Chan and Salma Hayek as superheroes was sexy and impressive.', ""The fact that 'Eternals (2021)' doesn't feel like a Marvel movie isn't an inherently good or bad thing. To me, it feels more distinct than most of the studio's other fare, but it isn't as entertaining. As a whole, the thing just feels a bit flat. It's messy, overly portentous and filled with some pretty baffling choices. Chief among these is the decision to have one of its characters straight-up disappear from the finale for no real reason, only to rear his head again just before the piece comes to a close. The ending (which includes two post-credits stings) is incredibly disappointing, evoking the exact opposite of its intended effect. There are plenty of other plot problems, too. They pale in comparison to the fact that most of the movie just feels fairly lifeless, though. It's pretty dull, to be honest. That being said, it does have its merits. Firstly, the cast are all really good despite the fact that they don't have much to work with. Ma Dong-Seok (here credited as Don Lee) is the obvious highlight, though he's criminally underused. Secondly, there are a handful of scenes which start to properly explore the interesting concepts inherent to the heroes' long-lasting lifespans. Unsurprisingly, the best of these involve actual conflict between the core characters and portray each player's different outlook on their unique situation. Sadly, most characters lack chemistry with one another and often seem isolated from the other people that share the frame with them. They aren't allowed to properly come to life, which is one of the biggest reasons that the piece just isn't all that compelling; we have nobody to care about. This also means that the movie feels as though it lacks real stakes, even though it's literally the entire Earth that's in danger. Without a character to latch onto, we simply don't give a second thought to the humans our heroes are trying to save. However, the feature is visually pleasing overall. The cinematography is suitably 'epic' and the various locations are presented with bold colours and distinct architecture. There are also a couple of entertaining, if slightly intangible, action sequences. The best of these, which is also the best portion of the entire affair, is a mid-point battle set in a remote village. For the most part, though, even the set-pieces fall short of the mark. Overall, this is a pretty disappointing film. It has a strange structure, a sloppy story and generally just feels a bit off. It's far too long, yet somehow not long enough; it would've been much better served as a mini-series. It has its moments, but it just isn't all that good. 5/10."", 'I went in knowing nothing about the source material and not watching a single trailer. I had no expectations for this movie. After watching it, I feel like it had the potential to be incredible. But it wasn\'t. It wasn\'t even good. I\'m legitimately sad while writing this.I see this as the MCU homage to Watchmen. It feels very ""adult"" in so many ways. But in others, it\'s childish. The story is a complete mess. So many useless side plots. The characters feel flat, especially the protagonist. Some uncharacteristically bad casting choices (while also criminally under utilizing Angelina Jolie, a beast of an actress, should have been the main character). So much of this movie doesn\'t feel natural, something always feels a bit off.There\'s a lot i enjoyed. I watched some of the coolest things I\'ve ever seen on screen. So many parts are visually stunning. Some of the action was good, some wasn\'t. An enormous step down in that department after Shang-Chi. The deep philosophical themes were interesting but poorly executed.Sigh. I\'ll probably watch it again to see if it grows on me. But this might be the worst MCU movie.Edit: I watched it again, in IMAX of course. I enjoyed it a lot more the second time. All of my initial flaws are still there. But I focused on all of the good, and tried to ignore the bad. It made for a much better experience, especially after moving past the initial disappointment of how truly amazing it could have been.I think the reason I found the protagonist so underwhelming is because she doesn\'t drive the plot. Her character is always reactive. Things happen to her. She\'s generally likeable, but a weak character. And one thing that was impossible to ignore even when I tried, Salma Hayek was a terrible choice.My favorite character is Druig, with a great performance by Barry Keoghan. I really like most of the other characters and wish I could have seen more from them. Kumail Nanjiani is awesome, except when they give him random ""insert joke here"" lines. I\'m curious to see more from most of the characters.This movie is still very flawed. And I absolutely hated how certain character conflicts were resolved after major decisions were made. But if you can move past the bad, you can enjoy the action, visuals, and ambition. Rating updated from 4 stars to 5 stars. (2 viewings, opening night 11/4/2021, 11/17/2021)', 'This was almost a dead-even 5/10 star film, but the more I think about it, the less I like it. I HAAAATED some of the incredibly cheap looking CGI. Sure, SOME of it was good, but our main villains, the devil-alien dogs were laughably fake looking and the 1st post-credit scene had this small ""creature"" who was about on par with Super Nintendo graphics. Also, only some of the humor landed, but most felt forced. I did LOVE all the diversity and acting - each actor really tried their best. The plot is okay, but it did drag and shoot, am I tired of hearing excuses when MCU introduces new Super-Human characters who were around for wars, including the Infinity War, and did nothing to help/prevent it. Either you need to reboot everything or make origin stories set in present day only. Finally, I 100% hated the inclusion of a particular reference in regards to comparing the lead male Eternal, Ikaris to another superhero.Overall, it\'s absolutely not the worst MCU movie, but it fits nowhere in the top half best. Since it\'s barely, like 1%, connected to the other MCU movies, it could be a skip for sure.', ""I've decided to watch it not because I wanted just because my friend invited to go together. Well, it wasn't amazing, I wasn't surprised in any good way, it was just an average movie with some great but also some awful special effects. The main idea was really bad, plot was very messy and hard to fallow, even The legend of.... was better movie, this one was one of the worst Marvel's movie so far."", ""A vastly different entry into the MCU but one that took me for a ride. It's impressive feat to take on a 10 lead character based film, it's another thing to make you care about every single one of them. Chloe Zhao has already shown us her talent with smaller films, and it's even more telling on a massive MCU scale that she's here to stay. It's hard to say what the best 2021 MCU film is at this point but Eternals has certainly made it's stamp on me. I had a blast.8.8/10."", ""Shang-Chi gave me hope for Phase 4 of Marvel. Eternals dashed those hopes. This is probably my least favorite Marvel movie. This film is too long and crammed full of overly complicated plot points, yet it's also completely predictable. It seems the filmmakers were too busy trying to check off boxes rather than create a good story. It's also a downer. People watch MCU movies to have fun, not to have existential crises. Perhaps the Eternals should have stood on the sidelines a little longer."", ""The 26th instalment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe marks the arrival of a new brand of superheroes into their ever-growing family and further expands the horizons of its shared universe with its grand scope. However, being one of the lesser-known properties the way Guardians was back in 2014, Eternals needed to create an intrigue & curiosity to make us care & invest in its mythic world but the film as a whole simply falls flat at it.Co-written & directed by Chloé Zhao (The Rider & Nomadland), her latest effort opts for a slightly different path that at times avoids or escapes the familiar trappings of a standard Marvel fare but then its attempts to forge its own identity is executed with such blandness that there is no life to it. The film is devoid of the fun & fascinating qualities of its studio's finest works and neither its storytelling nor its ensemble compel us enough to give a damn.It is an ambitious undertaking no doubt that intends to explore a few interesting ideas but Zhao goes for it without working out the fundamentals first. She aims for the intimacy with surface-level digging into these superpowered beings but with there being no incentive for us to even bother, the emotions & warmth don't shine through. Add to that, the story is needlessly overlong, tediously paced, and is filled with characters without camaraderie with one another.Overall, Eternals is a dull, lifeless & forgettable addition to Marvel Studios canon and also happens to be one of their rarest gambles that doesn't pay off the desired dividends. While the diverse ensemble is a welcome move from the inclusivity standpoint, the actors are more or less wasted in their roles and aren't given anything interesting to leave their imprint upon. It remains to be seen how this chapter plays out in Marvel's Phase 4 plan but as a standalone entry, Eternals is mediocre at best."", 'This is ranked as the least critically acclaimed MCU movie ever made and boy, can I see why. Having not liked ""Black Widow"" as much as I thought I would, I can easily say it\'s still better than this. This movie features the Eternals who were created thousands of years ago to protect the Earth from monsters called the Deviants. Halfway through, it\'s revealed their creators, the Celestials were planting seeds in the Earth as they must destroy planets to create a new Celestial. A planet must have a certain population before the Celestial seed can grow. Why didn\'t they intervene when Thanos destroyed half the Universe, seeing as how a reduced population would greatly hinder their plans?Much of this movie consists of them meeting each other with no action. I can now say that Scarlett Johansson is hotter than Angelina Jolie. While the special effects are breathtaking and the premise is interesting, it just doesn\'t amount to much. It could have easily been trimmed by a half hour and nobody would ever know. It\'s just okay as it does have a nice diverse cast and even the first gay couple in an MCU film! I\'m sorry to say we\'ve got the first of these films I didn\'t like, but it\'s still at least watchable. **1/2.', ""The movie isn't that bad. It's not like other Marvel movies. I really liked the acting, effects and music from the movie. The director's job and the cameraman's job were also great.

It's a movie and it's a comic book movie, I understand, but I don't like the story of the movie.It's not as bad a movie as it is generally said, but it's an average movie.I wish things were better. Also, the movie is a bit long.My rating is 7 / 10.P. S : By the way, this was the first movie I watched in the cinema after the pandemic."", 'Before creation Arishem of the Celestials created the first sun (quite a feat given the size plus trillions more) thus bringing light & life into the Universe. Note: Nice close filtered photo of our Sun. Then the Deviants came from deep space (no such thing as a deep location - all equal distant) to feed on intelligent life (why does it have to be intellgent?). Arishem sent Eternals to eliminate the Deviants; led by Ajak. Eternals space ship looks like a triangular piece of countertop granite - propulsion is?. Eternals put on fighting clothes, but oddly female breast sizes increase - a hidden weapon? Fights begin in Mesopotamia (listed as 5000 BC, but should be BCE); move on to Babylonia; Tenochtitlan; Iraq, Amazon; South Dakota; and London today. Asked how long they\'ve been together Sersi incorrectly says 5000 yrs. (should be 7000 for Earth, and millions of years for other places - they sure don\'t age much).Powers: The usual (overused) force & fire hands, fire eyes, super-fast, mind control, swords. Basic theme is ""Should humans be allowed to exist given their propensity to kill themselves as well as most species while destroying the Earth through consumption, contamination & pollution?"" More so as the population approaches 10 billion.', ""Eternals was a hash movie. A very weak mcu installment. I thought this movie would have been unique. It was it was uniquely hash. I didn't care about any of the characters or even lousy story.MCU struck out in 2021. Maybe Dr. Strange can end the streak.Don't watch this hash."", 'Greetings from Lithuania.""Eternals"" (2021) is big, ambitious movie with big ideas and good execution. The concept which i won\'t spoil or go into details reminded of me of Ridley Scott\'s ""Prometheus"" (2010). Only ""Eternals"" went way more deep into it. You have to give a kudos to creators for bringing this grand concept to life.I liked the visual side of ""Eternals"" very much. This movie looks amazing. Cinematography was gorgeous, special effects were great. Acting was solid but no Oscar will be won here - its just a great cast doing their good jobs. Directing by Chloe Zhao was pretty good for this big of a movie - at the beginning of the movie i kinda felt that its going to be a mess, but soon it picked up and at running time 2 h 25 min this movie was a good watch.Overall, while far from being best in this franchise, ""Eternals"" is probably its most ambitious movie in terms of idea and concept. Execution was solid and overall this movie delivered for me.', 'The movie opens up with a text scrolls that explains a short history of celestials and eternals. The movie goes back and forth between past and present showing us all things the eternals participated in history, including helping them advance their technology to the point humans make the bomb that hit Hiroshima and the conquistadors conquest through America. As well as all the times they protected the world from the alien monster called the Deviants up until the 1500s as they thought they had killed the last of them.Thena is the one that sparks them all to split by attacking the group but she doesn\'t kill anyone. The Prime Eternal, Ajak, offers to cure Thena\'s affliction at the cost of her memories to prevent more attacks but Gilgamesh steps in and says he\'ll watch over her. Druig ensues into a deep monologue about how he doesn\'t like standing on the side lines while humans slaughter each other, so he takes some of the nearby fighting humans and leaves. Gilgamesh and Thena go off and live in Australia together. Sprite and Sersi become companions during the time when Ikaris leaves Sersi. Sersi starts dating Dane Whitman and teaching at a primary school. Kingo travels the world and eventually becomes a popular Bollywood actor, even going as far as pretending to be his own descendants within a fake family so he can keep acting. Druig starts a colony in the Amazon. Phastos goes and lives his life by having a family, he has a husband and a son. Makkari has been living in their ship for centuries.After the Deviants start attacking again Sersi, Ikaris, and Sprite go and try to find their leader Ajak who they find dead, attacked by a deviant which now has her powers of healing and later becomes Kro. Ajak has a orb in her chest that allowed her to talk to the Celestial who made them, when Sersi finds the body the orb goes into her allowing her to speak to the celestial that made them. The team then goes and collects Kingo while he\'s making a film. They use his private jet to travel most of the movie, his valet tagging along to record a ""documentary"". They travel to Australia to collect Gilgamesh and Thena. While there Sersi talks to the Celestial again using the orb. They then find out that the celestial sent the eternals to protect a seed that was planted inside the earth. The seed grows into a another Celestial so long as the population grows. The Celestial made Deviants to kill predators on planets so that the intelligent population would thrive. But instead they evolved and started hunting down everything. So the Celestial made the Eternals kill the Deviants so the population may grow. Once the seed is done growing the emergence begins destroying the world creating a new Celestial after the complete destruction of said planet. The eternals minds are then erased and they are sent onto a new planet to destroy. Thena\'s memories weren\'t completely erased so that\'s why she\'s going crazy.After learning this information, they go and try to convince Druig to help put the celestial to sleep. There is a fight scene with the Deviants, as Kro eats Gilgamesh then becomes more humanoid. After some convincing Druig says he can\'t do it alone, and needs a machine built by Phastos to even think about potentially doing that. So they all go collect Phastos, Phastos is not convinced by the other Eternals that his husband is the one that convinced him to help. They all go back to the main ship in the desert where Makkari is residing, they tell her what\'s going on. Phastos\'s big idea is to connect them all in a uni-mind state allowing Druig to control the Celestial. Ikaris finally breaks after people start taking sides, calling for him to help make a decision for the team. It flashes back and shows that he was the one that fed Ajax to Kro and the other deviants allowing them to evolve further. He\'s also known for a long time their true purpose, but when he found out Ajak didn\'t want to destroy planets anymore he killed her. Ajak had decided to intervene with the emergence after she watched the avengers bring back everyone from Thanos\'s snap. The avengers bringing half the population back also sped up the emergence according to Ajak. The group then gets into a fight leading to Ikaris and Sprite leaving together. Kingo leaves too because he agrees with Ikaris but doesn\'t want to fight his friends. Thena convinces Sersi that what she\'s doing is right and that they need to save the planet.After Sersi is convinced to continue their mission to save earth, Phastos takes the sphere that allows Sersi to talk to the celestials to create bracelets to connect the eternals. They then fly in their ship to the source of the emergence. Once they arrive they connect to Druig in a attempt to control the celestial. Ikaris starts fighting the group, injuring druig so he\'s unable to complete his connection to the celestial. They then decide that it\'s best for sersi to use her powers to connect to the celestial to kill it. While the others in the group distract Ikaris, Kro comes in and starts a fight with Thena. Thena kills Kro and in doing so regains control of her memories. Phastos and Makkari are effective at holding their own against Ikaris, at one point Phastos has Ikaris trapped and unable to use any of his powers using some kind of power dampening device he made in the moment. Sersi attempts to connect the celestial but Sprite comes up and violently stabs her in the back with a knife. Druig then comes out of nowhere and knocks out Sprite with a rock. Sersi connects to the celestial and starts turning it into stone. Ikaris breaks free and tries to stop her, but realizes he can\'t because he loves her. Sersi then reconnects to the celestial but this time with the help of the other eternals completely changing it into stone. Ikaris starts crying because he can\'t decide whether or not to continue fighting them or join them, after this is done ikaris flies off straight into the sun. Sersi uses what little power she has left from connecting to the celestial to make sprite a human. It doesn\'t state whether or not she kept her powers though. Druig, Thena, and Makkari go off in their ship to find more eternals.Dane professes his love for Sersi and is about to reveal a secret about his family history when she, along with Phastos and Kingo, are remotely dragged into space by Arishem, who is displeased with their treason but elects to spare humanity if the Eternals\' memories show that humans are worthy of living. He vows to return for judgment before disappearing into a singularity, taking the trio with him.Mid-credit scene: Thena, Makkari and Druig are visited by the Eternal Eros (brother of Thanos) and his assistant Pip the Troll, who offer they\'re partnership.Post-credit scene: Dane Whitman opens an old chest inherited from his ancestors that contains the legendary Ebony Blade when an unseen person (identified off screen as Blade) questions him whether he his ready for it.']"
53,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Spider-Man: No Way Home,10872600,"[""It's immediately after the end of Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019). Spider-Man (Tom Holland) had been framed by Mysterio who also revealed his true identity, Peter Parker. He and his friends, MJ (Zendaya) and Ned (Jacob Batalon), are hounded by the media, demonized by many, and investigated by the authorities. Frustrated with his situation, he asks Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) to do a spell.This Spider group is a fun group. I love this young group and then there are the veterans. It's a great way to reincorporate the previous Spider-verses and the bonus is getting all these great veteran actors. They are all great at delivering complex characters. There is a bit of redemption for some who ended the previous versions on a down note. This is a good movie by itself as well as a good progression for the MCU."", ""Spider-Man enters the multiverse.

He just does not know them.Taking off from the end of Spider-Man: Far From Home. This movie has a slower first act as Peter is pursued both by the media and law enforcement.When a blind lawyer shows up it is the first nod that this movie has a lot that will appeal to Spidey fans.The motivations of some of the villains look weak and confused. However it is all there for one thing. The return of the other Spidermen.Both Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield return with their Spidersuits and it is a punch the air moment.It really is a joy to see the merging of the previous incarnations of the Spiderman franchise.

As a result villains who he has killed return from across the multiverse. You are expected to know string theory. Their return causes havoc and Spider-man must find a way to cure them before Dr. Strange kills them.In the grand scheme of things, Marvel has gone out of its way to explain the other Spider-man movies when no one really wanted or expected one. Having saved the universe a few times, I am glad to Marvel coming down to Earth and back to the basics without attempting to top each episode.', ""What cinemas were made for. I wasn't expecting something quite as amazing as this, this was two and a half hours of incredible entertainment, drama, laughs, tears and action galore, there truly was something for everyone here.This movie really has ignited my love for the franchise once again, and I am truly excited for what comes next.Nostalgia, there seems to be a real thirst for it these days, and there is a lot of it to enjoy here. There are plenty of moments throughout that will have you speechless, they really do break all of the rules here.This is one incredibly good looking movie, dazzling special effects, dizzying action scenes, two and a half hours will literally fly by.Incredible, 10/10."", 'There is so much to unpack here. And I understand that some people may not be into the first 30 minutes or so of the movie, but it is apparent how much almost everyone loves this movie. And as you can tell I am one of them. Now you could dismiss my opinion, since I have clearly bought and swallowed the MCU pill (I openly admit liking and being a fan boy of what has been created there - you can hate me or simply agree with me, all opinions are welcome) ... but I dare anyone who has seen all Spider Man movies, not to feel at least something rather positive about this.It does take many good things from previous efforts (no pun intended) and gets the best out of them. It does a great service to the (movie) history of Spider-Man. But also showing us a different side of a Marvel hero ... a side that is vulnerable in a way we have not seen yet. Or not in that form - the identity crisis and the good deeds that do not go unpunished ... or do they? Tom Holland has been exposed - something you know if you\'ve seen the previous Spider-Man movie ... and while his mentor Iron Man dealt differently with that fame - recognition, Peter Parker as we know him, can not deal with it the same way.Add to that, that he wants to help people as much as he can (a bit of a difference to what Tony Stark stood for most of the time, being self centered and and self serving) - and you have a dangerous combination. There is a reason the Tom Holland Spider-Man movies are being compared with 80s teen comedies - there are many parallels (John Hughes and others are being name dropped in those conversations). And while there is a lot of action (the mirror world scene has so many ""climactic"" scenes I probably did not close my mouth the entire time it was happening), the movie also takes its time to give us little character moments.And a lot of fan service - this movie celebrates what came before. It celebrates and takes its audience seriously. But in a fun and entertaining way. Yes it is not all fun and games and there are a lot of callbacks (no pun intended) - there is drama, there may be even some head shaking at how naive Peter Parker seems ... but it makes sense in the realm of the world that was built around him and the character that he is - there is an evolution, but he can\'t help himself - being who he is and who he grew up to be. For better or worse ... yes the famous line will be uttered and it will have a sad undertone to it. But the movie is able to give you so much, that even when you know something completely horrible is about to happen, you also know that some lighter moments will follow.That being said, it takes nothing away from the performance by Tom Holland, who has to play vulnerable, playful, ecstatic, experimental, shy and giving/helpful ... while a lot has been made of who is going to be in the movie (or not) - it is his movie. Yes there are many things that you can tear apart and make fun of - there are logic issues if you want to call them that ... but in a world where ""magic"" exists ... are you really going to nitpick? Maybe you will, which would be a shame - because you\'ll be missing out on one hell of a movie and a ride that is truly amazing - no pun intended.It is also amazing that Sony and Disney reached a deal - so that Marvel can continue to use Spiderman in their universe. But not just him ... it seems there is way more to come. And while having many throwbacks (and callbacks) and bringing them all to a conclusion of sorts ... well while all that could mean that this could be a nice way to end Tom Hollands reign as Spider-Man ... it could just as easily continue. The possibilities are endless going forward.As you can tell I am not one to spoil or say anything that is revealing. That is why I did not talk about the cast and the cameos - most of them were revealed ahead of time. Either officially (villains) or just through rumors (no matter how much denying went on - we knew ... we just knew) ... but there was a cameo that most did not see coming - pun very much intended.If you watched this in a cinema (which I can only highly recommend to do), you will probably still have goosebumps. You either cheered yourself loudly at quite a few moments (or gasped at others) ... or just enjoyed silently ... what a movie experience that was. One that I might repeat in cinemas - a treat I do not give myself too often, because I tend to let a bit of time pass before I rewatch something after the first time viewing ... but there are exceptions and this might very well be one of them ... Spider-Man you Sir ... are one of the good ones! Pun again intended - because you too are amazing ...', 'I believe this film entered IMDb\'s \'Top 250\' at number #9, briefly rose to #8, and has now settled down into the 17th spot as I write this, right between ""The Matrix"" and ""Goodfellas"". I go on this little rant every time a new comic book super-hero movie comes out, because in anyone\'s wildest imagination, this cannot possibly be the 17th best movie of all time. Not that it will stay there as time goes by, but it just boggles my mind how a movie\'s audience and IMDb voters can impact a film\'s standing when it first comes out. Anyway, enough of that.For me, I thought the picture was quite a fun and entertaining experience. The idea of the two former Spider-Man actors returning to the big screen to help out Tom Holland\'s current depiction of the character was just a marvelous touch. Combined with many of the past Spidey villains and that quick cameo by Charlie Cox as Attorney Matt Murdoch made this an exciting and unexpected pleasure. Anywhere else the whole multiverse concept could have been a huge bungle, but the screenwriters here did a competent job of melding the disparate universes into a cohesive story that didn\'t seem far fetched within the context of Spider-Man\'s comic book history.With over four thousand reviews already posted here for this movie, there\'s not a whole lot I\'m able to add to the discussion. Just know that if you go see this movie, it will quite likely exceed your expectations via creative story telling and superb visual effects. In other words, it\'s what you go to the theater for.', 'The new Spider-Man of the Marvel Cinematic Universe was introduced in Captain America: Civil War, then he got his solo outings, Homecoming was great, and Far from Home was good, I was highly excited for this third instalment for the hero. Basically, Quentin Beck has framed Peter Parker (Tom Holland) for his murder and exposed his secret identity as Spider-Man. Parker, his girlfriend Michelle ""MJ"" Jones-Watson (Zendaya), his best friend Ned Leeds (Jacob Batalon), and his aunt May (Marisa Tomei) are interrogated by the Department of Damage Control. The charges against Parker are dropped, with the help of lawyer Matt Murdock (Charlie Cox), but now the whole world knows that Peter is Spider-Man. Peter and his friends are constantly approached and gazed at by press and everyone at school, and the negative publicity causes problems. Parker, MJ, and Ned are devastated when their applications for MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) are rejected. Following this, Parker decides to visit the New York Sanctum and asks Doctor Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), to cast a spell and make the world forget that he is Spider-Man. Doctor Strange starts to cast the spell but is interrupted repeatedly by Parker wanting to alter it so his loved ones will retain their memories. The spell is corrupted, Strange is forced to contain it as it and destabilised and becomes potentially universe-ending and he makes Parker leave. Parker goes to the Alexander Hamilton Bridge and tries to convince the MIT Assistant Vice Chancellor (Paula Newsome). The bridge is suddenly attacked by Otto Octavius aka Doctor Octopus (Alfred Molina). During their fight, Octavius rips Parker\'s nanotechnology from his Iron Spider suit which bonds with his mechanical tentacles, allowing Parker to disable them. Then Norman Osborn aka the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe) appears and attacks, before Strange teleports Parker back to the Sanctum. Octavius, or ""Doc Ock"", is locked in a cell, along with Dr. Curt Connors aka The Lizard (Rhys Ifans). Strange explains that before the corrupted spell was contained, it summoned people from other universes who know Spider-Man\'s identity. Strange instructs Parker, MJ, and Ned to find and capture the other people from the multiverse. They are successful in finding and capturing Max Dillon aka Electro (Jamie Foxx) and Flint Marko aka Sandman (Thomas Haden Church). Meanwhile, Osborn splits from his Green Goblin personality and reclaims control of himself and May comforts him before Parker retrieves him. Osborn, Octavius and Dillon discuss their battles with Spider-Man and realise they were pulled from their universes just before their deaths. Strange prepares to reverse the contained spell and send the villains back to their respective universes, but Parker argues that they could have a second chance and be saved from their fates if they are cured of their powers and insanity. Strange disagrees with Parker, so Parker steals the contained spell, and traps Strange in the Mirror Dimension. May takes the villains to the apartment of Harold ""Happy"" Hogan (Jon Favreau), May\'s boyfriend and head of security for Stark Industries. Using Stark technology, they cure Octavius, but Osborn\'s Goblin persona takes control and convinces the uncured villains to betray Parker. Dillon, Marko, and Connors escape, while the Goblin fatally injures May, Parker is too late to save her as she succumbs to her wounds. May tells Parker that ""with great power, there must also come great responsibility"", before dying in his arms. Ned finds Strange\'s sling ring and discovers its power to create portals, and he and MJ use it to try and find Peter. They instead open portals to universes with alternate versions of Peter Parker, who were also summoned by Strange\'s spell. To avoid confusion, Peter from the Goblin, Octavius, and Marko\'s universe is nicknamed ""Peter-Two"" (Tobey Maguire), and Peter from Connors and Dillon\'s universe is nicknamed ""Peter-Three"" (Andrew Garfield). The group eventually locate Peter from this universe, nicknaming him ""Peter-One"", but upset about the death of his aunt, he is ready to give up and send the villains home to die. The alternate Peters share stories of losing loved ones and encourage Peter-One to go on in May\'s honour, and they work together to develop cures for the villains. The group lure Dillon, Marko, and Connors to the Statue of Liberty. As a fight ensues between the Spider-Men and the villains, Peter-One and Peter-Two successfully cure Connors and Marko. They are later joined by Octavius who arrives and cures Dillon, while Ned inadvertently frees Strange from the Mirror Dimension with a portal. The Goblin appears and unleashes the contained spell, causing the barriers to break down between the other universes. Strange attempts to stop the devastation while an enraged Peter-One tries to kill the Goblin. Peter-Two stops him while Peter-Three helps Peter-One inject the Goblin with his cure, restoring Osborn\'s sanity. As the multiverse falls apart, Peter-One realises that the only way to prevent further catastrophe and restore existence is to erase himself from everyone\'s memory and requests that Strange do so. Peter is given a few moments to say his goodbyes, he promises MJ and Ned that he will find them again. The spell is cast, the two Peters and their villains are returned to their respective universes, including Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy), who unknowingly leaves behind a piece of the Venom symbiote. Two weeks later, with all memories of Parker\'s identity erased, he finds MJ and Ned in a coffee shop and intends to reintroduce himself but changes his mind. He later visits May\'s grave, where he has a conversation with Hogan, again without revealing himself, but is inspired to carry on. He later makes a new suit and resumes his reputation as a vigilante. Also starring J. K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, Benedict Wong as Wong, Tony Revolori as Flash Thompson, Angourie Rice as Betty Brant, Hannibal Buress as Coach Wilson, Martin Starr as Mr. Harrington, J. B. Smoove as Mr. Dell, and Gary Weeks as Agent Foster. Holland is spirited, more vulnerable and likeable as before, Cumberbatch is reliable, Zendaya, Tomei and Batalon are good support as his loved ones, Molina, Dafoe, and the other well-known stars back as the villains is great, and of course Maguire and Garfield returning, and all three Spider-Men onscreen together was exciting. You completely forget that the film is almost two and a half hours long, the time is used wisely to tell a well-scripted story, with spectacular sequences of special effects magic, well-timed moments of humour and emotion, and surprise moments that will satisfy the fans, an inventive, exciting, and highly impressive superhero fantasy action adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects. Very good!', 'Right, well I am by no means a fan of superhero movies, but I will watch them when given the chance. Why? Solely for entertainment purposes, because Marvel Studios does make rather impressive movies, now don\'t they? Indeed. And that is also why I opted to sit down and watch the 2021 movie ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" here in 2022.Actually, my family went to watch ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" back in 2021 when it was out in the cinema, but I didn\'t go, as I don\'t think superhero movies are worth the ticket admission for a cinema. So instead, I opted to watch it when it became readily accessible at the comforts of my home.Writers Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers actually put together a wholesome enough storyline here for this movie, and sure it was watchable and enjoyable. Outstanding or memorable? No, not so much. But then again, I am not overly keen on the whole superhero genre. But ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" did provide me with entertainment for the 148 minutes that the movie ran for.And it was actually fun enough to watch the various Spider-Men come together on the screen and fight the villains from previous movies all over again. Nostalgia? Perhaps. But at the same time, sort of lazy writing when you think about it.Visually then ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" was phenomenal. But then again, that is what Marvel Studios excel at, isn\'t it?""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" certainly has a impressive cast list, with a lot of big names. I mean, you have Tom Holland, Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire as the Spider-Man, and then you have Jamie Foxx, Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, Rhys Ifans and Thomas Haden Church return to reprise their former villainous roles. And the movie also have the likes of talents such as J. K. Simmons, Marisa Tomei, Jon Favreau and such on the cast list as well.It was nice, though, to see that the writers were taking the many previous movies in the franchise with a grain of salt some times throughout the course of the movie, with the puns and snazzy dialogue hinting at and referencing previous movies.""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" definitely is a pleasing movie for the fans of superhero movies and of ""Spider-Man"" in general.My rating of ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" lands on a six out of ten stars.', ""It's hard to discuss this movie and not get into the spoilers because the biggest moments of this movie necessitate ruining several of the big reveals. I loved that not everything was in the trailer and I successfully avoided reading too much about the film, which helped my enjoyment. This was the first movie I've seen in a theater since Halloween Kills, so the risk of COVID-19 and all its variants didn't keep me away* from the biggest movie of the year.This movie arrives as so many older directors gatekeep what constitutes a movie. So let me break down my opinion: movies can be anything you want them to be. There is equal room for a high end Oscar contender as there is for the junk low end world that I live in, the places where Godfrey Ho, Jess Franco and Bruno Mattei make their home.What else are comic book movies other than classical myths made with computers and no small amount of sound and fury? So yeah, this is the 27th Marvel Cinematic Universe movie and you know, you don't have to watch these movies. Hollywood -- the world -- is still making something for everyone. But for crowd-pleasing moments, the two biggest I've heard in years are when Captain America lifted Mjolnir and when one of the characters arrived in this film, a literally explosion of happiness and joy from an audience that has weathered so much in the last two years.And isn't that why movies exist? To make us feel something?No movie that I have seen in a theater in nearly a decade has elicited that emotional outburst and you know, it brought true joy to my heart. So I didn't feel silly expressing my emotions, whether they were happy when a certain legal professional made his presence known or the sadness of Dr. Strange's final words to Peter Parker.Spider-Man has always lived by the lesson that with great power comes great responsibility. He's a character informed -- in every incarnation -- by a great loss that he was at fault for and a lifetime of making up for that mistake.Yet Spider-Man: No Way Home presents us with something new. Great power with responsibility also means being better than your enemies and at times, working to make them better people and not just punching them into oblivion. The fact that antagonists can be worth saving spoke to me, someone usually given to mad revenge schemes and years of grudges. Even when doing the right thing ends up hurting you, you still can do the right thing.These are big concepts for a comic book spectacle. And this movie does what all great films should. It's stuck in my mind since I saw it and I wanted some time away from it before I wrote this. Spider-Man is the story of a bully grown up and moving past the way he was treated, often finding those bullies -- Flash Thompson, Eddie Brock -- become if not friends, certainly no longer enemies.This also gets into the Marvel idea of a multiverse, a connected web of other realities where small differences -- Disney+ set this up with What If...? And this idea will form the heart of Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness -- but the main part of this story remains refreshingly human in the midst of big ideas, strange science and concepts like how magic works.Look -- I don't have to sell you on these movies. They make so much money that they're critic proof. But I do want you to consider that even if you hate superhero movies, even if you think there are too many of them, to consider your favorite film series. What if you had more than three of the original Star Wars films and they all were progressively better? What if the last Jason, Freddy or Hellraiser movie was so much better than the original? What if James Bond got more human, more relevant and more real as the world around him became even stranger?That's what's happening here. And it's amazing.*I'm triple vaxxed, beyond fastidious about mask wearing and personal space, and rarely if ever leave my movie basement. This isn't a political statement. Viruses don't have politics and if you think they do, you can kindly never read another word that I write."", ""This Spiderman is really fantastic. It captivated me right from the start, and I was entranced every second. There's adventure, friendship, team spirit, love, empathy, and brotherhood. The people in the cinema clapped and cheered multiple times, at the appearance of key characters and at big hint of what the future holds for Spiderman. I loved every second of it!"", '""Spider-Man"" fans are going to have a total nerdgasm over this movie. Those of us who haven\'t seen all the Spider-Man movies and aren\'t knowledgeable about the Marvel universe may have a good time but also might be left wondering what all the hoopla is about.I only saw the first two Tobey Maguire Spider-Mans and didn\'t see any of the Andrew Garfield ones, but Tom Holland is definitely my favorite actor to play him. This movie is too bogged down by exposition and has a saggy middle section that tries for heart-tugging drama -- why, why do these junk food movies try to be more serious than they should? -- but I will admit that the ending gave me the feels. I\'m not really chomping at the bit to see where this story goes next, but it was fun enough seeing this movie with my 10 year old son.Grade: B.', ""Peter Parker, outed as Spider-Man, and framed for Mysterio's death (see previous film), asks Dr Strange to cast a spell to make everyone forget he is Spider-Man. But things go horribly wrong, and the multiverse suddenly gets very real indeed.The trailer reveals the Doctor Octopus from Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 2 makes an appearance, thus linking the MCU with the original Spider-Man franchise, but it is worth watching all 5 pre-MCU movies beforehand because there are moments here which payoff all those movies.This is a very good movie notwithstanding the fan service. It's a good story, the action and effects are first rate, the performances are excellent, and there is a lot of emotion. Far From Home was very good, albeit a more intimate movie after the cosmic goings-on in Infinity War and Endgame, but No Way Home makes it clear that Phase 4 will be as capable of weaving intimate personal issues and massive threats as Phase 3 was."", ""SPIDER-MAN: NO WAY HOME (2021) ***1/2 Tom Holland, Zendaya, Benedict Cumberbatch, Jacob Batalon, Marisa Tomei, Jon Favreau, Jamie Foxx, Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, Thomas Haden Church, Rhys Ifans, JK Simmons, Benedict Wong, Andrew Garfield, Tobey Maguire. Game-changer in the web-headed franchise with Peter Parker (Holland at his most affable best) facing public awareness of his identity threatening his loved ones and involves Dr. Strange (Cumberbatch) to concoct a spell that goes sideways which splinters the MultiVerse with past foes of 'other' Spider-men to enter our own void. Stunning visual effects with astounding action sequences and peppered with enough meta humor for several film the apparent final chapter of the HOME trilogy does just that - hits home. A lot of fun and by all means splurge on the IMAX version."", ""I believe the last film I watched at the theater was that Lion King remake, but before that it was Spider-man Far From Home. I used to go to the movies all the time, but due to the whole pandemic thing I have not gone in a long while and add to that crippling depression making going out for me a very difficult task. That being said, I am a huge Spider-man fan and I have seen all the Spider-man films in the theater so I managed to get out of the house for my off day from work rather than just staying in bed all day. I was rewarded with a very good film, full of action and nostalgia; however, that being said due to my state of mind it also made me severely sad and a bit suicidal. Just hard for me these days to fully enjoy anything with me growing older and life becoming a pointless endeavor. Still, I enjoyed seeing the old villains, especially Dr. Octopus as he is my favorite Spider-man villain from the comics.The story, Mysterio's message at the end of Far From Home has Peter hounded by the press, taken in by agents and ruins his and his friends MJ and Ned's chances of getting into MIT. So Spider-man goes to Dr. Strange's place where he asks if there is anything the good sorcerer can do. Dr. Strange says he can make everyone forget Spidey's identity, but while in the middle of casting, Spider-man keeps adding stipulations causing the spell to go out of control. Soon enemies of Spider-man from the multiverse emerge and Spider-man must round them up so that they can be sent back; however, our hero soon learns that they are going to die and he wishes to help him despite Dr. Strange's protests. Soon Spider-man finds himself in the need of help as things get there darkest and he finds two other allies to help set things on the correct course.The film is good, but it definitely did not help my depression one bit. Watching the scene where MJ was rescued almost had me burst into tears, as I remembered the scene from one of the other films and remembered my fiance who has since passed away was with me during this time. I also felt alone as Peter was and feel a sense of hopelessness as my life has no meaning, so while a good movie, it probably can hurt someone who is struggling with bad depression as I am. I was honestly hoping for a more happy type film to make me feel a bit cheered up more than one that made me go further down...So a great film, one of the better MCU films and my favorite of Tom Holland's Spider-man films. I honestly, though, would love to see Garfield return to the role for maybe another Amazing film as it was good seeing him as Spider-man again and it would be nice to see some closure for his Spider-man. Heck, I would not mind another Tobey one either as that series never did have full closure either! That one is probably less likely due to Tobey's age though. I will say my only real complaint of the film is the lack of a new villain, this being due to the fact Spider-man has a whole gallery of villains so having a new one would have been easy and would have given the film six Spidey foes making them sort of a Sinister Six! That would have been cool, but still an amazing film all the same."", 'This film was entertaining enough. I liked the acting, the little gems, the sheer hubris of the story. However, it was for all intents and purposes, a universe consolidation move (before they break it all again in Multiverse of Madness). It\'s one of those reset stories, but one that manages to unite previous resets, which makes it the resettiest of them all. It is there to basically answer all the comic geek questions about how could so many films and reboots and stories exist in the same MCU and open the door to the future.There were no real new characters, some were explained away, some where killed off and new concepts of the incoming threats hinted at. One end-credits scene winked towards a Venom recrossing, while the second was basically a trailer for the next Doctor Strange film, not a ""scene"".So there is a difference between the typical Marvel cinematic universe film and this one: the villain(s) are weak and unfocused while the plot, however entertaining, just a background to the goal of the film: to stabilize the canon and prepare for the new Doctor Strange movie. This does mean the Strangeverse will grow and possibly be amazingly fun, but also that I don\'t see the Avengers going anywhere for a long while, except maybe TV series.In conclusion: for the fans of the Marvel stories and the faithful viewers of movies and series in that universe, this is a big nice bonus, a step on a promising ladder of new content. However as a standalone film it has limited value. It is a good film, and probably a necessary one, but its storytelling will not blow your mind in any way.', 'Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) to Peter (Tom Holland): ""The problem is you trying to live two different lives. The longer you do it, the more dangerous it becomes!""Notwithstanding the ""home"" in the title, the exciting new Spider-Man: No Way Home is more about the existential need to create one\'s own identity, the Christian need to give up a life in order to gain it, and the human need for a second chance. Many super-hero movies continue to emphasize the hero\'s need to recover a parent or child even more than the need to sacrifice for the good of humankind.As Peter Parker (Tom Holland) struggles with the attention he gets because Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal) revealed his identity, he gets involved with Dr. Strange to erase his super-hero identity from everyone\'s memory. Fooling with Mother Nature never is good in these hyper-active fantasies, and it\'s true as Peter tries to get Dr. Strange to reverse his initial memory-erasing spell in order to remain in the minds of those he loves.Besides, what director Jon Watts and his writers are really interested in is pulling the three Spidies together (Holland, Andrew Garfield, Tobey Maguire) to remediate former bad boys like The Sandman (Thomas Hayden Church), Doc Ock (Alfred Molina), Electro (Jamie Foxx), and Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe). Dr. Strange clears the way between parallel dimensions to let each Spidey\'s version of villains to come together for their cleansing.The imaginative and entertaining concept of getting these characters together proves not to be confusing but revealing of their generous natures and the benign fraternity of Spider-Men, adding the collaboration motif into their otherwise solitary lives.Although the digital gymnastics are impressive, beyond those is an attempt to flesh out character for both good and bad boys. Discoveries abound without super sentimentality or long exposition. Because the filmmakers have taken care to load meaning into most dialogue, the revealing third act takes the plot to dizzying heights while character spills out along the way.As more is found out about the heroes and the villains, the long road back to normalcy for Peter seems just about right, filled as it is with triumphs that come from working as a team (not a normal Spidey thing to do) to suffering the loss of dear ones to a better cause. It\'s a coming of age at any age and a satisfying display of character development that might be envied by indie films everywhere whose bread and butter is a similar attempt to show humans at their worst and best.Super holiday fare, yes; challenging, yes; amazed I am that comic-book stuff holds meaning amidst its visual splendor, yes.', '""Mining into the mass\'s oceanic nostalgia, by way of multiverses and at the expense of Doctor Strange (Cumberbatch) being uncharacteristically frivolous, the film has three Peter Parker converged into one universe as well as a motley of villains from Sam Raimi\'s SPIDER-MAN trilogy and THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN twofer, led by Willem Dafoe\'s Green Goblin, an outright terror. It becomes a confusion as hell when Peter Parker 1 (Holland) and co., girlfriend MJ (Zendaya) and best friend Ned (Batalon), attempt to \'save\' those villains (how \'holier-than-thou\'!) and no accomplished writers can make a virtue out of the desultory explanations of how that can be done (the corollary to mingle magic with science), all comes down to a devastating tragedy to plunge Peter into the nadir before he gangs up with Peter Parker 2 (Maguire) and 3 (Garfield), confraternity incontrovertibly triumphs over villainy, and when the dust settles, Parker 1 has a hefty price to pay, but he does it with resignation and renewed optimism.""read my full review on my blog: Cinema Omnivore, thanks.', ""Don't watch the trailers. Just watch the movie. I'm not going to say much. It's amazing. And I'm in complete disbelief that it actually happened. Well-made, well-acted, well-directed. Fun, funny and crazy with a ton of heart. Can't wait to watch it again. (4 viewings, opening night 12/16/2021, 12/29/2021, 1/20/2022, 2/2/2022)"", ""For the first time in nearly 20 years, I may have seen my favorite Spider-Man movie.And I'm not like a kid who loves the Ice Age movies and since part 17 is the newest one they've seen, it's their favorite. (Much like what they said about the 16 before it.) Nope. I sat from almost the first 10 minutes LOVING this movie and debating if this actually beat out the magnificent 2002's Spider-Man and its even better follow-up, 2004's Spider-Man 2.I will say this: This is my new 2nd favorite of ALL 27 MCU movies. Easy. And it's easily in the top three of the 10 theatrical-released Spider-Man movies. In fact, since part 2 in 2004, I have not been impressed with any of the Spider-Man movies until Spider-Man into the Spider-Verse and this third Tom Holland-led Spider-Man series.I barely liked Tom's Spider-Man: Homecoming and I refer to it Iron Man Jr because it was WAY more about Iron Man smarts and involvement and it clearly made Peter a complete moron who couldn't lift a finger or figure out anything on his own without big-daddy Tony helping. Tom's Spider-Man: Far From Home was better, but it still couldn't let go of Tony (EVEN after his character supposedly left the franchise.) This second rebooted version of Spider-Man of Tom Holland's made me sad, because of how dumb Peter is and how reliant he is on others, namely big-daddy Tony. This is NOT the brilliant Peter Parker I grew up with.But, FINALLY...they got it right with Tom's third movie. The trailer spoiled SO MUCH of this movie and the actors involved, as trailers are designed to be spoiler packed (usually the very last scene of the movie is in the trailer,) so I won't even go into the synopsis or what happens or who's in it. I just HIGHLY encourage you to see this ASAP and know: they FINALLY got Spider-Man right. After 5 disappointing follow-ups to Spider-Man 2, THEY FINALLY GOT SPIDER-MAN BACK ON TRACK.I laughed so hard, even though it wasn't like the traditional MCU movie where it's mostly a comedy. These were genuine jokes and not just inserted to please the audience who apparently wants more comedic MCU movies than action-packed Super-Hero movies. I cried a bit, even though it's mostly an uplifting movie. And yes, I marveled on how well acted and written this film is. Everybody gave it their 110% and no one stole scenes or out-performed anyone else. This was MY Endgame event.I loved this movie so much, I probably will buy it right away on Blu upon release. And to give you a hint of how much that is to me: I don't really buy Blurays anymore due to the convenience of streaming and of ALL 27 MCU movies, I only bought two so far. The rest, I can watch online if I feel like it. Most are forgettable, anyways.I heard they're building a new trilogy with Tom Holland continuing his role as Spidey. To be frank, before this viewing, I almost didn't want to see them. If this turned out just slightly better than Tom's 2nd one which was just slightly better than his mediocre 1st one, I was pretty much done.Now, my Spidey-Sense is tingling to see what they have in store for us next."", ""No Way Home starts with as much silliness as any Spider-Man movie in history. Peter Parker, unmasked, asks Doctor Strange to make everyone forget him, then hedges, then everything gets weird as a bunch of bad guys from previous Spider-Man movie series start wreaking havoc.The multiverse is, of course, a major component of Into the Spider-verse, but while that was brilliant and cool, here it comes across as profoundly silly.So in my head I was seeing this as the silliest of all Spider-man movies; a ludicrous romp with fun mindless action. And then, in a weird tonal shift, the movie gets really dark, and then tries to go back to the light-hearted bit with that hanging over it, and does some more really silly stuff, and some rather confused but fast-paced action, and then goes for a sad thing that I found kinda boring, and, well, what is this supposed to *be*.It doesn't make much sense, it's tonally chaotic, and as with the previous film, the action is fleetfully enjoyable but entirely forgettable.Still, a reasonable amount of the humor works, it's fun to see the way they play with the multiverse, and there's definitely fun to be had. But I find it perplexing how many people love this movie because to me it's a mess. It should have just stuck with silly all the way through."", 'A tough one to rate. It certainly has entertainment value, but it\'s frustrating that it could have been so much better. On the one hand, the concept of bringing villains and other Spidermen in from alternate universes is fantastic, and it was great to see some of these characters again. There is so much star power in the cast here, and the special effects are wonderful.On the other hand, there is quite a bit of bloat as well. I\'m all for character development and non-action scenes in action movies, but too often these moments were poorly written and bogged the film down. I have to say, I didn\'t care for how naïve Tom Holland\'s version of Spider-Man was either, and I could never buy in to the concept that he would try to ""fix"" the villains before sending them back to their own universes. This seemed asinine to me, and how that would stop them from dying where they came from was a mystery too. There are several other plot elements that are either weakly crafted (Dr. Strange getting trapped by some quick Spidey-math) or boring (Peter Parker and his friends and their college admission drama, good grief). Give me more of the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe), less of Ned Leeds, the goofy sidekick.', ""For me, it was really good movie. It will find place in top 10 movies of 2021 in my list. The only thing I didn't like was dialogues and that whole drama, everything else was perfect."", ""Ending a trilogy is typically a monumental task, but what No Way Home accomplished is nothing short of miraculous. What they kept from audiences successfully, the technical feat, the story they put together and most of all the brilliant performances, should be commended for years to come. It's hard to argue with people that this is the best Spider-Man film to date. I still need more time. All I'll say is, 2021 is the most consistently great year Marvel has ever had and we should never doubt their ability ever again.9.5/10."", ""They did it! A Spider-Man trilogy finally stuck the landing! Spider-Man: No Way Home is an impressive culmination of the films that came before it, with an engaging storyline, exciting action, laugh out loud moments, and dramatic consequences. The beginning climb is a little slow, but it's an exhilarating ride once things get swinging. I don't exactly know how this movie will hold up after multiple viewings, as there are some plot points that don't quite make sense when you start to think about them, but I thoroughly enjoyed myself this first time."", 'Well, if this is the last ""Spider-Man"" movie with Tom Holland, we certainly went out on a high note! This film starts off exactly where the previous film left off, with Peter Parker being revealed as Spider-Man by Mysterio who frames him for his death. Matthew Murdock ends up defending him, but people still mistrust him. They don\'t make any mention of the technology being revealed to have used holograms though. Peter wishes for Doctor Strange to erase everyone\'s memory of him being Spider-Man, but the spell messes up and he ends up accidentally summoning villains from the other Spider-Man movies! This all happens in the first thirty minutes!As many people guessed, Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire did indeed appear in this movie (as Spider-Man, of course). It\'s great to see them all working together so we can finally compare each other. Here I was thinking that the Andrew Garfield movies were completely pointless! This is easily the best light we\'ve seen the Lizard and Electro in, or really any Spider-Man villain. It\'s weird how Garfield and Maguire didn\'t appear until an hour and a half in the movie! This is when you realize that the film has such fantastic pacing. I\'ve never seen a crossover with the same actors playing the same character!I\'m just going to go right now and say that Tom Holland is my favorite. I\'m so glad to have remembered all of these movies to fully understand what\'s going on everywhere! Doctor Strange is pretty great and the scene after the credits was really more of a trailer for the next ""Doctor Strange"" movie than an actual post-credits scene. We get amazing visuals and incredible ideas with many iconic characters playing off of each other wonderfully. I think Spider-Man worked well off of Spider-Man, and Spider-Man also worked well off of Spider-Man, and even Spider-Man worked well off of Spider-Man! I\'m so glad to have seen this as a very belated Christmas present! ****', 'One week after Quentin Beck\'s attacks in Europe and subsequent framing of Spider-Man for his murder, Spider-Man\'s civilian identity as Peter Parker is revealed to the world. Parker and MJ flee to his apartment, reuniting with his aunt May and Happy Hogan. With the apartment surrounded by the Department of Damage Control, Parker, MJ, Aunt May, and Ned Leeds are interrogated but ultimately released without charge with Peter\'s name being eventually cleared with the help of Matt Murdock. Parker, MJ, and Leeds return to high school but their university applications are rejected due to the recent controversy.Parker consults with Stephen Strange in the Sanctum Sanctorum, asking him to cast a spell to make people forget he is Spider-Man. Despite Wong\'s warning of the consequences that could be incurred, Strange casts the spell anyway. However, the spell is damaged when Peter\'s constantly changing requirements destabilize it. Strange then berates Peter, after finding out that Peter didn\'t even try to contact the MIT acceptance board before coming to him to request a potentially universe-ending spell. Parker goes to the Alexander Hamilton Bridge and tries to convince an MIT administrator to accept Leeds\' and MJ\'s applications. Suddenly, the bridge is attacked by Otto Octavius, who rips Parker\'s nanotechnology from his Iron Spider suit, causing it to bond with his mechanical tentacles. Upon discovering that this isn\'t the Peter Parker he had previously fought, Octavius has his robotic arms disabled by the nanotechnology, before being captured and placed in a holding cell in the Sanctum Sanctorum, along with Curt Connors who has been captured by Strange. Strange reveals that his spell has begun bringing everybody from every part of the multiverse who knows Peter Parker is Spider-Man into their world. With the help of MJ and Leeds, Parker decides to help capture any other possible ""visitors"". They find and capture Max Dillon and Flint Marko.Elsewhere, Norman Osborn is retrieved after going to a F.E.A.S.T. building seeking help. Strange wants to send the villains back to their respective universes and meet their fates. However, Parker wants to cure and help them before sending them back in order to prevent their fated deaths. He frees them and confines Strange in the Mirror Dimension after a brief fight, taking the villains to Happy\'s apartment. Parker successfully cures Octavius by using Stark Industries technology to replace his broken inhibitor chip. When cures are developed for Osborn and Dillon, the Green Goblin persona takes over Osborn before the cure can be administered. Goblin then manipulates Dillon into removing the device that Parker put on him to cure him and, despite the best efforts of Parker and Octavius, the other four escape. In the ensuing battle, May is critically injured by the Goblin, with Parker unable to save her as she succumbs to her wounds. MJ and Leeds accidentally learn how to open portals using Strange\'s sling ring, which they use in an attempt to find Parker, but instead summon an alternate Peter Parker from a different universe. A second attempt brings through another alternative.Leeds and MJ find their Parker who is comforted by MJ, after learning of May\'s death. He then meets the other Spider-Men, who share their own stories of losing loved ones and encourage him to fight in May\'s honor. They cooperate on curing the remaining villains and lure them to the Statue of Liberty. Leeds and MJ protect the original bind spell by Strange as the Spider-Men battle their enemies together. As the three Spider-Men struggle, they decide to plan a coordinated attack on the villains. They are later joined by Octavius, and they manage to defeat and cure Connors, Dillon, and Marko after a lengthy battle with Dillon reconciling with his universe\'s Spiderman and is encouraged to abandon his villainous tendencies.Leeds accidentally frees Strange from the Mirror Dimension, who seizes control of the spell and works to protect the current universe as the barriers begin to break down between the other universes. Meanwhile, an enraged Parker fights and overpowers the Goblin, intending to kill him in vengeance for May\'s death, but he is stopped short by the Parker from Goblin\'s universe, only for the latter to be stabbed from behind by the Goblin. Parker then injects Goblin with the cure, restoring him to a regretful Osborn. Peter and MJ confess their love for each other and share a passionate kiss before the spell officially starts. To prevent further catastrophe and at Parker\'s request, Strange fixes the spell, sending the alternate Spider-Men and their villains back to their respective universes, while making everyone forget Parker\'s existence. Later, Parker tries to reintroduce himself to MJ and Leeds, but finds himself unable to do it. Parker visits May\'s grave, joined by Happy, now oblivious to his identity, and vows to carry on. Parker creates a new suit from scratch to resume his independent heroics.In a mid-credits scene, the universe-displaced Eddie Brock and his symbiote companion Venom sit at a bar and talk with the bartender about other super-humans and the Blip. While pondering how to ""protect"" this new world, the duo is swiftly transported back to their universe by Strange\'s spell, unknowingly leaving a part of the symbiote on the counter.']"
54,Wizarding World,Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,241527,"[""Having read the first few Harry Potter books before 2001 and hearing about the hype for the first movie, I was excited. I heard there was going to be an all-British cast (which makes sense, right?) and we'd get to see a live version of one of the defining novels of our generation. From what I remember I went with my family and a family friend to see the movie the day after Christmas and was pleasantly amazed. After the movie was over, I watched the credits and discovered some familiar names (the late Alan Rickman, Sister Act's Maggie Smith, James Bond 007's Robbie Coltrane, and Star Wars' Warwick Davis); others not so familiar (the kids, some of whom had their debut). But it was a good movie and was a party of colors and sights for all to see. This is easily my favorite of all the Harry Potter films. The catalyst of the movie series!"", 'There\'s nothing like the first in a series, is there? The introduction to the characters, the immersion into the fictional world, the first time you laugh, cry, care, and fear for someone\'s safety can never be repeated. No matter how many Harry Potter movies they crank out, or if they ever remake them in the future, none will come close to the wonderful first film, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\'s Stone.I\'m sure everyone has their own childhood memories of reading the Harry Potter books that they\'ll tell their grandkids about, but I\'ll never forget going to see the first movie in the theaters. The lights dimmed, John Williams\'s perfect theme played its first notes as Richard Harris walked down Privet Drive, and everyone in the theater was transported to another world. John Williams\'s numerous themes, all wonderful and a personification of the wizarding world, took the early movies to another level. As other composers tried their hands at the later films, that quality was missing. There\'s something truly special about going to see this movie on the big screen, and while the ""magical"" qualities might not all be credited to the music, it\'s certainly one of them.Welcome to the world of Harry Potter, where if you\'re a ten-year-old kid who doesn\'t fit in, you might get a letter delivered by an owl telling you you have magical powers and should go to a special school to hone them. Believe it or not, there are people who watch this movie without reading the books, so a bit of description is necessary. Obviously the stars of the show are the children, who were selected out of millions of other kids to be able to memorize lines, not look in the camera, endear themselves to worldwide audiences, and hopefully act. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, and Tom Felton are so cute and tiny in this first movie, you\'ll undoubtedly find yourself re-watching it as the years pass just to see them as kids again. I always marvel that child actors train themselves not to look in the camera, so even if their performances aren\'t perfect, I cut them slack, knowing firsthand how hard it is. And these kids had to dress in funny costumes, recite incantations without laughing, and pretend they\'re looking at things that were added in post production!Usually, in kids\' movies, there\'s a grown-up or two who add to the cast and make the adult audience members feel less silly that they\'re watching it. In the Harry Potter movies, everyone wanted to be in them! Throughout the series you\'ll see a host of familiar faces as ""guest stars"" but the regulars will make special places in your heart. Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, and Robbie Coltrane are household names for little kids, because they\'re so convincing as the kindhearted Dumbledore, the wizened but sentimental McGonagall, the endlessly mimicable Snape, and the jolly Hagrid, kids today can\'t imagine they\'ve had any other career prior to these movies! Is there any kid who doesn\'t immediately attribute the word ""earwax"" to Richard Harris, point out striped cats as ""Maggie Smith cats"", mumble ""Shouldn\'t have said that,"" when they make a mistake, or practice putting pauses in their sentences like Alan Rickman?First movies are so special, since they introduce audiences to a world that will hopefully capture their attention for however many more movies will be made. In J.K. Rowling\'s fantasy world, there\'s so much to fall in love with; and in the film adaptation you can really believe it exists. Seeing the Hogwarts structure for the first time creates a special feeling in your heart that can only be recaptured by watching the movie again or going to see the next in the series. The Great Hall, Quidditch, the Sorting Hat, talking portraits, flying lessons, selecting the perfect wand-all these Harry Potter moments are perfectly recreated in the first of a series that saw an entire generation grow up buying toy wands and trying Bertie Bott\'s Every Flavor Beans.Each installment has its special moments, and this first one has quite a few, even outside of the exposition. If a three-headed dog doesn\'t immediately conjure the name ""Fluffy,"" chess pieces have never come to life in your imagination, you don\'t laugh at the idea of counting your birthday presents, and you don\'t know what Richard Harris wants most in the world, you\'re missing out on one of the great joys in life. If somehow 2001 passed you by without a trip to the movie theaters Thanksgiving weekend, go find yourself a copy of this iconic, lovely movie.', ""Once upon a time (and not that long ago), in the vivid, fertile imagination of author J.K. Rowling, a character was born: A boy. A young boy named Harry, who was destined to become one of the most beloved characters to emerge from a work of fiction in a long, long time, and was quickly embraced by young and old alike in all corners of the world. And now, thanks to the magic of the cinema, Harry and his companions fairly leap from the pages of the novel to the silver screen in the phenomenal motion picture, `Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,' directed by Chris Columbus and written for the screen by Steve Kloves. Indeed, Harry Potter is a boy, but not just any boy; because Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) just happens to be a wizard. But, orphaned as a baby, Harry has been raised by his Aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw) and Uncle Vernon Dursley (Richard Griffiths), who never let him in on the fact that he was, well-- what he was. It seems that Petunia didn't approve of her own sister-- Harry's mother-- because she was a witch; nor of Harry's father because he, too, was a wizard. When Harry turns eleven, however, the secret is out of the bag when-- after some strange goings-on-- a giant of a man named Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) shows up at the Dursley's door to collect Harry and take him off to `Hogwarts,' a school for wizards and witches and all who would perfect the gift with which they were born: The gift of magic! And from the moment Harry boards the train (from station platform nine-and-three-quarters) that will take him to his destiny, the magic is alive-- for Harry, and for the audience, as well; and it's a journey you will never forget.\tWhat a monumental undertaking to even think of attempting-- translating and transferring this passionately beloved work from novel to the screen. Because to millions of people, Harry and his companions are so much more than merely characters in a book; these are characters for whom people have made a special place in their hearts, which puts a great burden of trust upon the man who would attempt to bring them to life. And Chris Columbus, it turns out, was the right man for the job. More than rising to the occasion and with some magic of his own-- and a lot of help from an extraordinarily talented cast and crew-- Columbus has delivered a film that is not only true to the story, but true to the very spirit that makes Harry Potter so special. The special effects are absolutely beyond astounding, and Columbus, with a keen eye for detail and without missing a beat, keeps it all on track and moving right along at a pace and with a sense of timing that makes this an absorbing, thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable experience from beginning to end. From the opening frame you get the feeling that you're about to have a singular experience; and you're right. Because you've just entered the world of Harry Potter. And it's magic.\tEven having the best special effects do not a great movie make, however, and this film is no exception; what catapults this one to the top are the performances, beginning with Radcliffe, whom you quickly forget is an actor playing a part. And that about sums up what kind of a job this young man does here. Without question, he IS Harry Potter, physically and emotionally, and when he waves his wand and does what he does, you believe it. A wonderful performance by a gifted actor who has a great career ahead of him; without question the perfect choice for the role of Harry.\tAlso turning in excellent performances are Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley, and Emma Watson as Hermione. As with Radcliffe, the casting here could not have been more perfect. Grint is `Everyboy,' with that special glint in his eye and a manner that makes him especially endearing. And the spunky Watson adds some real sparkle to the film as Hermione, the one with the sense of urgency and the wherewithal to get things done; a real role model for young girls everywhere.\tIt's obvious that a lot of care went into the casting of this film, and it's a big part of why it is so successful. Richard Harris, as Headmaster Albus Dumbledore; Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall; John Hurt as Mr. Ollivander; Ian Hart as Professor Quirrell. Exceptional performances from one and all, with two that stand out as especially memorable: Robbie Coltrane, who readily conveys the fact that Hagrid's heart is of a size that matches that of the man; and Alan Rickman, as Professor Severus Snape, deliciously droll while demonstrating menace through the fine art of articulation. \tThe additional supporting cast includes John Cleese (Nearly Headless Nick), Warwick Davis (Professor Flitwick), Julie Walters (Mrs. Weasley), Zoe Wanamaker (Madame Hooch), Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy), Harry Melling (Dudley) and David Bradley (Filch). From Rowling's imagination to the written page to real life (albeit via the movie screen), `Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' is a triumph many times over; a unique film of truly universal appeal, the likes of which is as rare as, well-- a sorcerer's stone. A film in which adults and children alike will rejoice, because it speaks to the heart in a universal language of life, love, experience and imagination; a film that states unequivocally that magic exists-- as long as there's a single child with a single dream somewhere in the world, and real wizards like J.K. Rowling, Chris Columbus, Steve Kloves and every member of this wonderful cast and crew around to bring it to life as they have here. An instant classic in every sense of the word, this is truly a film for the ages. A remarkable achievement, this IS the magic of the movies. I rate this one 10/10."", ""To be faced with the challenge of adapting Harry Potter for the Silver screen must have been any director's nightmare- the chance of directing possibly the biggest film of this decade, but also the hardest audience-the millions of fans of the book who know every line and will pick up on every mistake. Being one of the above, I can only say that Christopher Columbus and all of the team working on HP did marvelously. The cast was brilliant (particularly notable are Alan Rickman as Snape, Maggie Smith as McGonagall, and the eerily creepy David Bradley as Argus Filch), the directing wonderful, and the scenery perfect. The only qualm is that it does not track perfectly with the book, but squeezed into 2.5 hours, this can only be expected. Well done all involved!"", ""Like a lot of others, I refused to watch this film when it was originally released, thinking it was going to be another movie for kids, loosely taken from the source. Was I ever wrong? J.K. Rowling's novel was brilliantly taken from book to screen. The acting, directing and especially the special effects were tremendously awesome. Director Chris Columbus did a superb job with the direction, I was surprised he didn't get an Academy Award nomination. The acting was too, excellent, especially from the experienced actors like Alan Rickman playing Severus Snape. Truly one of his best performances.A great adaptation of a very popular book, a fine example of cinema."", 'I enjoyed this movie immensely. But, like ""The Phantom Menace,"" I\'ve had a very hard time viewing it objectively. There was so much anticipation leading up to its release, I simply enjoyed the experience of being there. Having read all four books in the series a few times each, I am overly familiar with the events in the story. As I watched the movie, my continuing thought was ""How well will the next part of the story be translated to the screen?"" rather than ""How entertaining is this film overall?"" I have trouble answering the latter question because I was already entertained by watching a wonderful story dramatized, so I\'ll never know how I\'d have reacted had I seen this movie without having read the books.Critics talk about how incredibly faithful the movie is to the book, and perhaps I\'d have had an easier time detaching the two in my mind had the movie set off on its own course. Indeed, many classic children\'s movies, like ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Mary Poppins,"" are so successful partly because they\'re so different from the books that inspired them. But these are exceptions; in my experience, most children\'s movies reveal their weaknesses in how they diverge from the books upon which they\'re based. And much of what makes the Harry Potter phenomenon unique is that it is the first time in ages that a children\'s book, without a movie accompanying it, has generated this much popularity. According to an article I read a year ago, the universe of Harry Potter has become as real in the minds of youngsters and adults as that of a popular movie series like Star Wars. Therefore, it will be very hard for any film based upon it to compete with it. In the minds of die-hard fans, any changes made to the story will be seen as desecrating the fantasy world that Rowling created. That\'s why it\'s easy to understand why the filmmakers were so reluctant to change anything.As a faithful rendering of the book squeezed into a two-and-a-half hour period, the movie is beautifully done. I don\'t have a single complaint about any of the actors, who successfully bring to life, with the aid of costume design and special effects, the many colorful characters from the book. My favorite character, the giant Hagrid, is played by Robbie Coltrane, and I say with no exaggeration that he is exactly how I imagined him while reading the book. It\'s as if they took the image in my mind and transferred it to the screen. While I had my own personal image of Snape (for some reason, I always imagined him as the head villain from another Chris Columbus film, ""Adventures in Babysitting""), Alan Rickman is perfect in the role. I usually expect to have words of criticism for some performances, but I just don\'t. The remaining adult actors, including Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall and Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore, are as good as they possibly could be, and the kids do an excellent job of holding their own against these veterans. Some have criticized Daniel Radcliffe for appearing too subdued in the title role, but that\'s exactly how the character is portrayed in the book: modest, unassuming, and laid-back. The kids who play Harry\'s two best friends are flawless.I had a lot of worries about the fact that it was being directed by Chris Columbus, whose entire directorial career so far has consisted of over-the-top slapstick films. I was pleasantly surprised that he did not direct the Harry Potter film in this way. Except for brief moments like the children\'s delayed reaction to a giant three-headed dog they encounter and Harry\'s swallowing the quaffle ball, there is nothing here to remind us that this film is directed by the same person who gave us films like ""Home Alone"" and ""Mrs. Doubtfire."" Indeed, I think Columbus may have gone just a tad bit too far in trying not to make the film seem cartoony. I would have liked to see a little more emotion on the actors\' faces at certain times. Overall, however, his restraint works nicely in giving the film the kind of believability the book possesses.But much is left out. Harry\'s caretaker Uncle Vernon, a prominent character in the book, is given less attention in the movie than some of the bit characters. The gently satirical aspects of Hogwarts School aren\'t in the movie at all. We never see the ghostly history teacher who died several years back but kept on teaching. Lines like the following--""Professor McGonagall watched [her students] turn a mouse into a snuffbox--points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers""--find no equivalent in the movie. The movie does include platform nine-and-three-quarters, though the way the kids disappear into the wall isn\'t as mysterious as I had visualized, and the sorting hat is there, minus the great poem explaining the differences between the four schools.Not that I\'m blaming the movie for omitting some details. Some things from the book would not have translated easily to the screen, and it would have been very difficult to stick everything in. Had Columbus done so and allowed the film to be as long as necessary (eight hours, maybe?), like a BBC miniseries, the film might have been a masterpiece, but few kids would ever have had the patience or attention span to sit through it.The problem is that the amusing details are much of what make Harry Potter such a special story. A whole universe is created in Rowling\'s series, in which a magical society exists within our own ordinary ""muggle"" world and is kept secret by a bureaucracy with its own rules, history and politics. The way magic is treated in her books, not as something medieval but as very similar to the way our own contemporary world works, is a large part of their charm. Take away these details, and you\'re left with a fairly conventional tale of a young wizard fighting an evil sorcerer.Although the audience I was with broke into applause as soon as the movie ended (something I\'ve never seen happen before, though I don\'t go to the theater that often), some people have complained about the movie dragging at certain points. I didn\'t have that problem, but, as I said, I wasn\'t really trying to get involved in the movie\'s story. After thinking about it, it does seem like parts of the movie fail to convey a sense of urgency. Why should this be? I never felt that way when reading the books, and this is without a doubt the very same story.The answer, I think, is that the books portray much of Harry\'s anxiety in trying to succeed in school (for if he\'s kicked out, he\'ll go straight back to his horrible uncle) and fit in with the kids there. The movie doesn\'t tap into these anxieties enough, so why should we care whether he wins the Quidditch match (other than that he survives in one piece) and gets through the school year? The only real suspense in the movie after he arrives at Hogwarts comes from the story of Lord Voldemort returning, which in the book is almost secondary. Harry\'s adventures getting along in the school are fun and interesting, but as they are presented to us in the film, there isn\'t enough tying them all together.What we have here is a serviceable dramatization of a wonderful children\'s series, but it doesn\'t entirely succeed in standing on its own. Perhaps it should have diverged from the book just a little, to compensate for the difficulties in translating some of the book\'s delights to the screen. In its current form, it\'s almost like a preview of the book. Its lack of fullness, and its dependence on the book, might actually increase the popularity and endurance of Rowling\'s series by making those who see the film yearn for more, which they can get from the real thing.', ""We live in a world where economics is hard. This forces practical limitations when making a movie. Time and money are sadly finite, cinema owners need to be pleased as well as fans and computer animation ain't perfect. Given these limitations, this film is about as close to human perfection as it is possible to achieve. However, it's extremely clear what an immense challenge it is to turn Philosopher's Stone from book to film.Two and a half hours is not long to explore a wonderful, magical world. Furthermore, the directors have bowed to the inevitable temptation to show us things that cannot be communicated so effectively in a book. The consequence is the feeling of a slightly breathless sprint in places.It also means that the movie has to stay true to the spirit of the book rather than to the letter of it. There are omissions and there are changes. The changes that were made capture and maintain the spirit of the story really well; indeed, there are places where the story is more clearly and straightforwardly told in the movie than in the book. Some aspects of the story are fleshed out on screen and the additions are delightful, completely in keeping with the flavour of the world.The humour of the movie is inevitably more visual than that of the book; no belly laughs, but a lot of smiles. Some punchlines have changed, but the reasons why the jokes are funny remain the same. Not knowing exactly what's coming next is a good thing! It's all kept tasteful, classy and above the belt; there's nothing to cringe about.The voice acting is almost uniformly brilliant. However, there are occasions where some of the actors are required to convey high emotions and are only given a second or two of face shot, or head-and-shoulders shot, to do so. This isn't as much freedom as they need and they fall a little short. The blame here must fall on the decision to give the actors too much to do too quickly, not on the actors themselves.Other than these rare jarring instances, the physical acting is frequently excellent and seldom less than completely adequate, judged against the highest of targets set by the book's clear emotion descriptions.Dan Radcliffe has the look, the mannerisms and the charm of Harry down pat. His strongest expressions are the bemusement that must be inherent at entering a world where science does not rule alone and the bravery that Harry shows in his achievements. Emma Watson possibly slightly overplays Hermione, but does so in a fully endearing fashion. There's one scene which gives her too little chance to truly express panic; otherwise her performance needs no changes.Rupert Grint has comic timing way beyond his years, hitting Ron's lines perfectly. Tom Felton makes a stylish Draco; Matt Lewis' Neville character suffers from the acceleration, so the finale does come as a slight characterisation shock.The Phelps brothers' Fred and George are distinctively cheeky rather than proactive pranksters; Chris Rankin imbues Percy with genuine authority. Sean Biggerstaff shines; his Oliver Wood is likeable and an ideal Quidditch team captain.Robbie Coltrane's Hagrid is the single dominant adult character, with maximum laughs extracted at every step. The movie changes strongly exaggerate one side of Hagrid's nature, though; probably inevitable considering how much plot exposition his character has.David Bradley has a vicious Argus Filch; John Hurt's Ollivander is an eccentric treat, giving a wonderful introduction to the Wizarding World. The professors are uniformly excellent, though Richard Harris' Dumbledore comes off as disappointingly flat until the end.The most ambitious point of the movie is the computer generated imagery. The stills are wonderful, but the fastest animation is restricted by the limitations of real-world technology. The book makes extremely stringent demands of the CGI; sometimes their overall effect in the movie is merely good rather than insanely great. Some of the magic spells and effects look awesome; others don't capture the imagination nearly so much.The world cannot yet completely convincingly animate human beings doing inhuman things, which serves as a clear reminder that you need fictional magic to make the impossible possible. The Quidditch scene is the most demanding of them all; while the sequence is action-packed and good-looking, disappointingly, it's not a total success. Perhaps some of the scenes would have been better with more conventional special effects? (For instance, the lower-tech-looking Sorting Hat scene is one of the most delightful of them all.)The set looks gorgeous. However, it may not stand up to detailed analysis. It's fairly obvious that things are shot in many disparate locations, rather than one big Hogwarts School near Hogsmeade.The score is absolutely wonderful. The soundtrack may rely too heavily on The Famous Bit, but it's clear that the balance and mixture of things in the finished movie are exactly right.The feel of the whole movie is everything fans could have hoped for. The dialogue is intensely measured, the colouring is suitably epic, the selection of what to leave in is really tightly considered. You get chills in your spine at the right places; you feel the triumphs as all-encompassing endorphin highs. It's clear that the production have thought long, hard and lovingly. They are true fans of the story, they are the right people for the job, it all bodes very well for the second film.So it could never have been the film that the hyper-literalists were hoping for, then, but it is as good as the practicalities of the real world could possibly permit. Don't expect miracles and you'll love it. I look forward to watching it again and again.8/10 at the very least. A really satisfactory film!"", 'This movie is a delight for those of all ages.I have seen it several times and each time I am enchanted by the characters and magic.The cast is outstanding, the special effects delightful, everything most believable.You have young Harry, a mistreated youth who is ""Just Harry"" to himself. And then, he embarks on a most beautiful adventure to the Hogwarts school.He meets Ron and Hermione, one an adorable mischief maker, the other a very tense and studious young lady.Together, the trio try to set things right in the school.It\'s the ultimate fantasy for young and old.', ""I watched this movie first time when I was left with no choice. My expectations were extremely low as I always wondered if Harry Potter books were over-hyped. How-ever after watching the movie it did make me a Harry Potter movie fan. And needless to say - this continues to remain my favourite of HP series. That brings to a point here.... the effect of expectations over a movie. True, expectations reduce joy.Without going into the story I would certainly say Chris Columbus churns out a perfect pot-pourri of emotions, suspense and magic, delivering something appealing to all ages.Every character brought to life on screen has done justice and leave an impression on you. Particularly notable performances by Emma Watson and Alan Rickman.CGI are in plenty and made good of. The Quedditch game is picturised amazingly. The wizard's chess is treat to eyes.Let's hope that the forthcoming HP series carries the similar magical touch."", 'To millions of children of all ages, November 16 has been more eagerly anticipated than Christmas, as the long-awaited film version of J. K. Rowling\'s beloved novel ""Harry Potter and the Sorceror\'s Stone"" hits the screen.Each of Rowling\'s four Harry Potter books have been critically acclaimed worldwide best-sellers, turning a generation of video-game playing children into avid readers.In translating Rowling\'s world of wizards and magic to the screen, the film makers claimed to be intensely aware of the fans\' high expectations and had sworn to be faithful to the book.""Harry Potter and the Sorceror\'s Stone"" is indeed the most loyal film adaptation of a book that this fan has ever seen.It\'s the story of an orphaned boy who discovers on his eleventh birthday that his parents were wizards and that he is in fact a famous and powerful wizard himself.Released from the clutches of his desperately ordinary (and non-magical) Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia - and their deliciously obnoxious son Dudley - Harry takes his place in the wizarding world as a first year student at the venerated Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.A great deal of ""Harry Potter and the Sorceror\'s Stone"" is an introduction to this fantastic and dangerous world and its richly drawn characters. There\'s not only a lot of plot to cover in this film, but an entire world to create.At two and a half hours long (hit the restroom before it starts), the film includes the book\'s most memorable scenes, bringing many of them to life with pure cinematic wizardry.The Quidditch match (a soccer/hockey/rugby thing played on broomsticks) is much more exciting on the screen than on the page, as is the bathroom battle with an enormous mountain troll and the larger-than-life game of wizard\'s chess.The frightening aspects of the book are in full force in the film, and its PG rating (for some scary moments) should be taken seriously. Screenwriter Steven Kloves (""Wonder Boys"") has done a fine job of streamlining Rowling\'s tale while maintaining its spirit. Director Chris Columbus (""Home Alone"") makes good on his promise to be faithful to the book. But at times the film is a bit too reverent; you want the actors to cut loose and have a bit more fun.Columbus clearly understands that fantasy works best when it\'s played most real. Across the board, his fine ensemble of actors are so perfectly cast that they appear to have literally stepped out of Rowling\'s book. In the title role, Daniel Radcliffe pulls off the very difficult task of playing an introverted hero who spends most of the movie reacting to the amazing sights and events around him. He beautifully captures the deep soul and untapped potential of Harry Potter. And when this kid smiles the screen lights up.Rupert Grint is delightful as Harry\'s sardonic buddy Ron Weasley and Emma Watson nearly steals the film as their overachieving friend Hermione Granger. Three cheers to the film makers for giving three unknown child actors the top billing they deserve.The strong cast of veteran actors includes Richard Harris as the wise Headmaster Dumbledore and Robbie Coltrane as the lovable giant Hagrid. Alan Rickman is wonderfully villainous as Professor Snape and Zoe Wanamaker has just the right touch of girls gym teacher as flying instructor Madame Hooch. As the strict but just Professor McGonagall, Oscar winner Maggie Smith seems born to play the role - and is ready for another Oscar.John Cleese (as Nearly Headless Nick) and Julie Walters (as Mrs. Weasley) have all-too-brief cameo roles, but if the next film ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" remains true to the book, we\'ll be seeing more of them.In addition to being highly engaging, the film is a marvelous thing to look at. From the bustling wizard street Diagon Alley to the magnificently gothic Hogwarts School to the dark and misty Forbidden Forest, the film breaks new ground in imaginative production design.To paraphrase the film\'s tagline, let the magic (and box office records) begin.', 'When I knew the film was being made, I thought how could they make a film that would be up to the standard of such a perfect book. But they did! Sure they missed bits out but they captured the essence of the book brilliantly. One member of the cast was mis-cast for me but my children disagreed.I even found myself believing they were flying and not wondering ""how are they doing that?"" So 10 out 10 Warner Brothers. Bring on the next one!', ""I feel, next to Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the best book-to-movie adaptation that I've ever seen. The sets were stunning - the actors were first rate - the effects were breathtaking. The film flowed quite smoothly in it's transition from page to screen, never tripping on the awkward conventions that other books on film have struggled with.  The screenplay, by Steven Kloves, stripped away all unnecessary elements to get to the root of the story. Though many events from the book were excluded, the essential ones made it to the film. And it makes for one smooth story and very enjoyable movie-going experience.Many kudos to Chris Columbus and the rest of the Harry Potter cast/crew for not turning this movie into what it easily could have become: a 2 and a half hour commercial advertisement for action figures and collectibles, kid's meals and fast food tie-ins, soft drinks and snack products, etc. and instead focused on bringing J.K. Rowling's story to life as accurately and as lovingly as it deserves. There has been much speculation on whether Columbus was the correct choice for the first two installments of the series and I say to that, Yes. I feel that he accomplished what most would have failed. He has proven, at least to me, that Diagon Alley truly exists - if only I could find the right brick to tap on. The world of Harry Potter is no longer fantasy to me, but instead a place where any of us mere Muggles could hope to visit, one day.One of my favorite moments, is what I'm going to refer to as the Adrenaline Sequence. By Adrenaline Sequence, I mean the sequence in a movie that for all intents and purposes, doesn't necessarily propel the story, but gives the audience a huge theatrical payoff, ala the Pod Race sequence in The Phantom Menace. The Adrenaline Sequence for this particular movie is the Quidditch sequence. I was very happy to finally see the 'hockey/soccer hybrid on a broomstick' come to life. The Quidditch Sequence is, by far, my favorite sequence in the whole film. The scene is dizzying in it's violence and it's one breathless moment after another. My hat goes off to Columbus and his team for succeeding in making this scene as memorable as it should be.Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a fantastic movie for children of all ages. Fans and non-fans alike will enjoy this colorful story of good versus evil and the friendships that endure."", ""Ah, the first film adaptation of the beloved Harry Potter series. Harry Potter is an 11-year-old boy who comes to find out that he is a wizard. He lives with his uncaring Muggle (non magic) aunt, uncle, and cousin since his parents died when he was a baby. They were murdered by a dark and powerful evil wizard named Lord Voldemort. Harry would be dead too, but was miraculously saved, making him something of a legend. Upon learning of his guarded magic roots, Harry gets enrolled in Hogwarts- a British school for witches and wizards. While there he learns to come into his own, meet people that are actually good to him, and learn more of his dark past. Looking back, I don't know if it was a good idea to have Chris Columbus direct this, as he does have a reputation for being something of a hack, albeit a decent one. I think his direction is okay here. Yeah, retrospectively it could have been better, but it could also have been much worse. At least with him at the helm we get a good amount of whimsy to go along with a bit of menace, and that's a good thing, as the book was likewise not too heavy on the darker stuff (though that sure changed as time went on). Many liberties are taken, which is weird since the book is quite short, and the film is two and a half hours. It does get the point across decently enough though, and also works as a piece for those unfamiliar with the source material. John Williams provides great music, there's wonderful art direction and set design, and there's some nifty set pieces too. Featuring an all-British cast, this film is impeccably cast, and the performances are good too. Finding decent child actors is hard, but they really scored here. My enjoyment of this movie has waned over time, but it's still not a terrible piece of work by any means, so check it out."", ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is a film directed by Chris Columbus. For many years, I hadn't given a damn about the Harry Potter series. But seeing the fanfare surrounded by the series, I decided to give it a try. After watching this one, I can definitely say that I am on the verge of being a fan.Plot: Harry Potter, an orphan living with his uncle and his family is invited to Hogwarts School of Magic to become a wizard.Story and direction: I had watched this part around the time it released but never just kept in touch since I didn't understand a word. Seeing it now as an adult and a movie lover, I just fell in love with this fictional world created. The characters, settings, story, etc.. all just feel seamless. Thanks to J K Rowling, Steve Kloves and Chris Columbus who have done justice to the source material provided to them. I feel the themes are so very relevant in this film. The intricacies of those themes are valid in the current world we do live in. This is what I just exactly want from any story presented to me. Although the film is very long, I never felt bored for a single moment. And to adapt quite a huge novel comes with responsibility and precaution, which the makers completely justified. The sets are huge and awesome. You just feel you are in Hogwarts actually. Also each characters costume is just to marvel at. John Williams once again just proves why he is the composer of the century. But I did feel some flaws to the film. Being a first film, the main plot of the film comes at around the 90th minute of the film. Also the VFX of the film felt very amateur considering some great VFX was done in the years preceding this film.Performances: I would say that the casting of the film is just perfect. Applause for the casting team is deserved. Never do you feel that another actor should play the role. The kids, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Tom Felon just to name a few are fantastic. These 10-11 year old just steal your heart. Also the other cast like Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane make themselves likable.Favorite Scene: There were many favourite scenes in this film for me. But one scene in particular was the troll scene where Harry and Ron decide to save Hermione and after the saving Hermione vouches for the boys. This is the scene where you actually happen to see the bond solidified between the 3 as friends.Verdict: For anyone who just loves fantasy film and worlds with great visuals, this film is just for you. I assure you won't be disappointed. I plan on seeing the entire series now because I am fascinated by this world and want to see what else has it got to offer.I am going with an 8/10."", 'When I first saw this movie I was ten years old, the same age the characters where supposed to be. My older cousin and her boyfriend took me to the Mall to watch a movie. Back then I wasn\'t going very often to the cinema, due to the fact that my parents didn\'t have time and I wasn\'t old enough to go alone to any theater. The movie captivated my attention like nothing before and I became so interested in anything that had to do with this movie, and I heard that it was made after a book. I didn\'t had Internet back then, but I found the first book at a library and convinced my mother to buy it. That\'s how I became obsessed with reading and writing.I may say, ""Harry Potter"" affected me in a positive way, because after I finished reading all the published books back then, I wanted to read more books and I must thank J.K.Rowling for her genius, if it wasn\'t for her books, I might have been right now an average seventeen year old, at some party, drinking my brains out. This movie got me to the right path in life.I know, you probably don\'t care about my story, you readers only want to hear about what I thought of the movie, but I believe my story can influence you if you are a parent and thinking whether or not you should let your children watch this film. My advice is yes and I have presented my reason above.The story is simply magical and ""Hogwarts"" is a genius invention. The movie is done well, almost perfect. It\'s the closest to the book they can get and it\'s an amazing experience for any kid.', ""I really liked this film, but I much prefer the book, which has a lot more magic and wonder. Daniel Radcliffe is very likable as Harry, and he is given solid support by a funny Rupert Grint and a good Emma Watson, though she was annoying at times. The scene stealer was definitely Robbie Coltrane; I actually can't imagine anyone else playing Hagrid, Coltrane was just hilarious. Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith were also great, but for me the standout was the late Richard Harris. Now I much prefer Harris's interpretation of Dumbledore. He was soft-spoken, and actually fitted the part better. Both of these qualities were lost in the interpretation that Michael Gambon gave. I am not saying that Michael Gambon was bad, he just wasn't my ideal choice for Harris's replacement. The film is fairly faithful to its source material, and looks very beautiful. However, it is a bit long, and very young children may find Voldemort too frightening. I know because I have triplet brother and sisters who saw it, and couldn't sleep for about a month after viewing. In conclusion, a very good film, well performed and quite dark. 8/10 Bethany Cox"", 'It\'s seem like just yesterday, when the movie about the boy whom lived, was about to come out. People were wondering if the Harry Potter\'s books by J.K Rowling could easily be translated into the big screen. Harry Potter and the Philosopher\'s Stone AKA Sorcerer\'s Stone directed by Chris Columbus, indeed show that it was somewhat possible. The story follows Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe)\'s first year at Hogwarts School of Wizardry as he discovers his gift and destiny against the dark forces of magic. The movie like the other films are cut into two plots directions. One is about student life at Hogwarts during the school-year, while the other half is about the mystery that Harry Potter must uncovered that year. It works well as a long read novel, but in movie form: its means a long sit through. The movie pacing is so long. It takes forever to get to the main plot of Harry Potter finding the Philosopher Stone. There are is a lot of filler scenes that could be cut away. I dislike how the Philosopher Stone is one-time movie McGuffin. For the best of my knowledge, the Philosopher stone plays no factor after this movie, and never mention again after this film. The third act, mostly comes out of nowhere. The twist toward the end, was pretty predictable, if you readt the books, but pretty interesting. Another thing about the movie is how non-logical the movie is. It really baffled me, how much exposition, it needed. Even an hour in the film, there were a lot of random odd things happening without much explaining. It gets more confusing as long bits of the book, like the Centaur showing in the woods, were shorten in the film. It gets worst for the centaur, as he wouldn\'t play a factor, in any of the later films, despite, saving Harry Potter from Voldermort. Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) was also cut short. Her riddle solving in the book was cut from the film. Several minor characters have been removed from the film version, as well. Despite those, the movie is really close to the novel. In my opinion, don\'t bother, trying to understand the logic of all the wizard terms, because it will take you out of the fantasy movie, and give you a headache. Still, there were some really dumb things to nitpick here like why would Professor Dumbledore (Richard Harris), even allow Harry Potter to stay with the Dursley\'s family when he knows that they\'re horrible people. Honestly, the Dursleys could had killed Harry Potter with the childhood neglect! What was he thinking? Harry Potter could had commit suicide, or gone crazy like Lord Voldermort! What an idiot! The whole movie is about children being danger all the time. I don\'t care if they\'re wizards in training, I\'m surprise that the death tolls of students dying isn\'t as high as it should be. The school staff is questionable at times. A good example of this stupidity, is punishing students whom went out at nights, by sending them out at nights in the dark forest, where they can get attacked by creatures. The most insulting thing in logic is the black/white one-dimensional view of good Vs evil. Honestly, how on earth is the members of Slytherin never got expulsion for all the bullies that it has? You would think, that at less, there would be one good person in Slytherin. Another thing that bugs me is the whole the power of love conquer all. I think, children are a lot smarter than the childish message, the film is trying to pull. The acting in the movie is pretty bland, for the most part. After all, most of the child actors had this film as their first roles. I wouldn\'t say that Harry Potter\'s film series, have the most entertaining of dialogues, anyways. The wooden delivery, felt like a read-through. Most of what they\'re saying are stating the obvious or repeating what happening on screen. It\'s so annoying. The other actors were master British thespians, who seem to over-act at times. A good example of this is John Hurt & Alan Rickman. It was too hammy for already over the top world. The action scenes were pretty well-done. My favorite had to be the Quidditch match and the whole chess game. I can do, without the whole troll scene. The CGI troll hasn\'t aged well. Visually, the movie is beautiful to look at. I love the special effects, locations & set, and costume, they did. It really made the Harry Potter world, stand out. The music by John Williams is amazing to listen to. I think director Chris Columbus was indeed the best choice for this first movie, as he got the magically part, right and how to make a family picture. You even see, how much things, he establish that other directors would reused time after time. Still, I really hope for Terry Gilliam like J.K Rowling\'s first choice to be the direction. The movie has great social commentary themes like the metaphor of racism, ethnic cleansing and why Nazism is bad. You can also see possible influences from other words, that made Harry Potter work. There was a few controversial moments leading up to the film, like religious debates. A few religious groups claim that Harry Potter contain occult or Satanic subtexts that isn\'t good for children. Another one is the use of the word, sorcerer over the word philosopher in the title. US & British have different meanings to the words, plus marketing though, it would better to call it sorcerer as that word get more appeal. Due to this different, all scenes that mention the philosopher\'s stone by name had to be reshot, once with the actors saying ""philosopher\'s"" and once with ""sorcerer\'s"". Overall: The movie might has its flaws, but majority, a great first watch for any fantasy fan.', 'I watched all Harry Potter movies when I was 7 years old. After five years I watched the movies again at 12 years old and I feel this saga a classic, well, it is a classic. I started reading the first book like one day ago. Which my mom gave to me when I was a little kid. I like Harry Potter a lot and I would watch all the saga again', 'There is a major difference between reviews here and this is very easy to explain. Anybody who (like me) has read the books multiple times, knowing the slightest details and loving absolutely everything from the series, can´t be completely happy with the film. For the neutral watcher who read the books maybe once or not even at all this movie must seem like a really entertaining and well directed film. The problem is that though very good acting, especially Alan Rickman as Snape, a beautiful scenery and very good camera work, the most important essentials of the books are pretty much non-existing. For instance, I, as an hardcore fan since the first time reading the books when i was 9, was always extremely interested in reading a passage of a normal school lesson or a normal day at any job of an fully educated wizard, eg in the ministry of magic. Rowling made us have the desire to always experience more of the universe she created. I was always amazed by the lightness and uncomplicated way of Rowlings writing, how she managed to let us accompany Harry in his daily life, making the actually extremely strange and funny way of the magicians life seem so normal and casual for the readers. The film on the other hand is more of a build-up to Harry´s first encounter with Voldemort, a scene that´s perfectly directed with impressive effects and good filming, which is definitely the highlight of as well film and book, with the difference that the book is more focused in describing Harry´s adventrous first year as a whole. The film is a little bit inconsistent in terms of how close it sticks to the book´s plot and this is another problem. Because of the book being so comprehensive and full it is nearly impossible not to skip any sections of the book. In my opinion the screenwriter should have either sticked closer to the book or distanced the filmplot more from it. Another thing i miss is the great dry humour the book is spiced with in a lot of ways. The problem is that this can´t really be translated in the movie because it´s often in the way Rowling describes things and not only in the dialogues. One thing that is awesome is the music. In my opinion John Williams is the best film music composer and the way he captures the mysterious and thrilling atmosphere and the majesty and greatness of Hogwarts is marvelous. At the end I can say that the film can meet the expectations but it´s just not possible to convince a haerdore fan completely, just because while reading the book, everybody creates his own picture of Hogwarts, the characters and the scenery. This is called imagination, it is the best part of reading a book, not possible to be translated completetly satisfyingly into a movie and the reason to my big recommandation concerning Harry Potter and also every other book which is filmed. Read the book first! If you watch the film first and read the books afterwards you´ll miss a great time imagining everything for yourself. And this will come espescially pronounced in the books of Harry Potter.', ""in 2001, in the film Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, began one of the best sagas of all time, based on the book of the same name by JK Rowling, the film hit full in the cast, all actors are great in their characters, Daniel Radcliffe this impeccable as Harry Potter, the resemblance is too large, Rupert Grint this great as Ron Weasley, Emma excellent Watson as Hermione Granger, Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid, Richard Harris as Dumbledore (which unfortunately from the third movie substituted series, having deceased), Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman great as Snape, Ian Hart, Tom Felton, and etc, all goods, the special effects are great, the picture is great, especially the castles, the soundtrack is very good, and full of great moments, as the final, obvious that the movie has errors, the script has some problems, and the film is very long, I think it was longer than it should, and the film is faithful to the book, even with some missing characters, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a very good film, and marks the beginning of the saga of the Wizard in the movies. Note 8.2"", 'The breeze stirred the neatly cut bushes of Tisovaya Street, silently lying under the ink-black sky. Of all the streets in the world, this street was the least suitable for amazing events. Harry Potter turned in his sleep. A small hand groped for it and squeezed the envelope. The boy was asleep ... ""(c)June 30, 1997 in the light came the debut of the writer Joan Kathleen Rowling. Literally such words began to become great, a series about a small wizard, with a scar on his forehead. The story that absorbed the minds of adolescents around the world, as it was said in the press ""... a book that can tear boys and girls away from TVs and computers, return it to the house from the street ...""Just imagine...""A dull, dank, dark night. In the street a storm. The little boy lies on the floor of his ""room"", in a small shack and draws a finger in the sand with an inscription, ""Happy Birthday, Harry!"". The cry of the soul, he knows that no one will congratulate him, no one will affably caress the top of his head. In a minute he will be eleven. Ten seconds ... Nine ... You can wake Dudley - just for laughing ... Three ... Two ... One ... A loud knock at the door, there\'s no knock, just a crash. There was someone behind the door, and he was obviously going to come in. ""I think anyone will guess what happened next. Good-natured giant Hagrid, told Harry the striking news that he is not just a boy with a scar on his forehead, but a real magician.A short word about the actors.HarryWhat to say, there would not be Harry James Potter, there would not be the book itself. Whatever happens in the books, I was always entirely for his character. In the first part, he\'s just small, you can even tell a confused boy. All situations, difficult fights, intricate situations, are still ahead. Now he just scooped up this great knowledge - magic. The first real home, first friends, first classes, the first meeting with this evil, he is experiencing all this in the first part. HermioneHermione Jane Granger is my favorite female character in the book and film. In it, I see a part of myself. Hermione loves to learn and she pays a lot of time. Sometimes she is too arrogant and excessively proud of her success in her studies. Born of a muggle, so often heard the offensive word ""Mudblood"" in her address. Hermione is just a smart girl, how many times she has yet to pull friends out of difficult situations.RonRonald Bilius Weasley. Redhead. Already this word can give some characteristic. Ron is the sixth child in a wealthy family of hereditary magicians. Always the elders took on everything superior to Ron, be it study, sport, or female attention. Arriving at Hogwarts, gets to know Harry, the same situation is repeated as with the brothers, but he reconciles with his second plan. Whatever it is, he remains the best friend of Harry and Hermione.I wanted to say that the whole trio was exactly the same as it was represented by millions of readers in the world. Actors took absolutely unknown, but this film made them real little stars.The movie has good enough, more famous actors, the same Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane, Julie Walters and the inimitable Richard Harris. His death was just a blow to all the fans, his Dumbledore seemed to come off the pages of the book, the same wise look from under the half-glasses, gray hair and beard, hooked nose. He inspired a kind of majestic calmness, every appearance on the screen calming. By the way, I do not consider Michael Gambon a good Dumbledore, he turned out to be some kind of crazy, but this is not on this topic. It is quite possible to write now a complete retelling of the book / movie, but you know, absolutely do not want to. Joan Rowling created an amazing, magical world, thanks to her, millions of boys and girls began to look for a scar on their foreheads and with impatience and hope to wait for their 11th birthday. And I\'m certainly happy about how Chris Columbus embodied this idea on the screen, the fairy tale turned out to be absolutely childish, very bright, joyful and for some reason the word Christmas comes to mind, although there is not so much Christmas there.Children\'s dream came true. Harry found his friends, his family, found loyal defenders, but he does not even suspect what he will have in the future. However, it will not be soon, but now enjoy watching!Dedicated to: all those who are ready to go with Harry to the end.', 'HARRY POTTER / (2001) *** (out of four)Here\'s a method of evaluating a movie based on previously published material: ask yourself if the film makes you want to read the material from which it is based? Before the release of ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\'s Stone,"" I was one of the few remaining souls who had not read J.K. Rowling\'s fantasy book series. After screening the first film installment, I did want to read the book. Borrowing the novel from a family member, I briefly skimmed over the chapters. The book\'s intelligence and similarities with the film really surprised me. With over 100 million copies sold in over 46 different languages, J.K. Rowling\'s best-selling series of books has become a worldwide phenomenon. Naturally, with soaring expectations abound, the filmmakers felt great pressure to create a faithful adaptation. They have. This film is essentially a visualization of the words in the novel, with very few differences. That said, the film does run into a few conflicts with the book\'s story. The middle of the movie has nowhere to go. It\'s like a false second act; almost nothing of major significance occurs in this period of the film. The young characters wander from scene to scene with nothing much to do and nothing much to say. We\'re left with a grand display of eye-popping special effects. ""Harry Potter"" certainly dazzles us with a solid beginning and an engaging final act, however. We first meet a young wizard boy named Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe). Soon after the film opens, the boy discovers he has magical powers. He\'s then thrust into an enchanting world of sorcery, magic, and witchcraft. He\'s sent to a school for young wizard children, where he meets new friends, learns about magic, and participates in fun competitions. But someone at the school doesn\'t like Harry, as mysterious events begin to occur. Harry soon finds himself in the middle of a diabolical scheme of revenge. Who is the culprit and what do they want with Harry? The film asks some involving questions. Too bad it doesn\'t give enough depth to the side characters or subplots. We don\'t really care about the mystery because we don\'t know enough about the suspects. The movie does conclude with a twist, but it doesn\'t encourage another examination of the movie. It lacks a foundation altogether. The story spends so much time foreshadowing the villain\'s identity, it is pointless for the story to abandon its proceeding plot points and develop a new villain at the end. The book gets away with this; the movie does not. After his gentle ""Home Alone"" and sweet-natured ""Stepmom,"" many questioned the ability of director Chris Columbus to bring a sense of darkness to the story-and for good reason. ""Harry Potter"" contains charming, likable characters and a rich pallet of lush, inventive images. Unfortunately, the film lacks an edge. It\'s missing the dark atmosphere Rowling\'s novel so vividly brought to life. Columbus does construct some memorable sequences, but the individual scenes themselves are much better than the movie as a whole.Despite it\'s childish story and pre-teen characters, many define ""Harry Potter"" as a film for all ages. While that\'s debatable, during my screening, adults were plowing through the isles every five minutes. Going to the bathroom? Getting drink refills? Buying concessions? Who knows? But not a single child budged from their seat. Their eyes were glued to the big screen. Conclusion: It\'s a sure-fire experience for children, especially if they\'ve read the books. But adults may not encounter the same enticement as kids. Then again, if I had nothing better to do than to count the people leaving the theater, why am I recommending the film?', 'Over-hyped but still enjoyable ""event"" movie, one of the biggest of 2001 until LORD OF THE RINGS comes out, and a film in which every million of the budget is put up on screen in the special effects. What I found most refreshing about this blockbuster is that the entire cast is made up of British actors and actresses! It makes a change for an expensive blockbuster movie to be thus but there you go, HARRY POTTER is indeed a unique movie. Now I\'m not one of those people with lots of time on their hands to read the never-ending Harry Potter books (too busy watching cult movies I\'m afraid), but the film has turned out pretty much as I would have expected from the adverts. Although it\'s overly sentimental (blame it on director Chris Columbus) and aimed at children, adults can still enjoy it for the excellent pacing (rarely does the two-and-a-half hour running time drag) and the plethora of special - and some not so special - effects on view throughout.Highlights include an attack in the school\'s toilets by a huge, lumbering troll, a life size game of chess in which the pieces come to life to destroy each other, a cloak of invisibility, a man with two faces on opposite sides of his head, and the finale which includes a scene of a man disintegrating into dust as a homage to Hammer\'s Dracula and is just as impressive. The CGI effects are elaborate and generally flawless, and the only ones I didn\'t care for were the ""broomstick flying"" shots in the quidditch game which still ended up looking a little too fake for my liking, which is a shame as they\'re used excessively. Otherwise the effects work is phenomenal and something to be seen.Daniel Radcliffe takes on the rather subdued role of Potter, and is overshadowed by two excellent performances from Rupert Grint as the lovably cheeky Ron and Emma Watson as the bossy Hermione. The supporting cast are generally excellent, with fine turns from Richard Harris as Headmaster Dumbledore, Robbie Coltrane as the giant Hagrid (whose weight bizarrely fluctuates throughout the movie), John Cleese - briefly - as an unsuccessful ghost, Nearly Headless Nick, John Hurt as a wand dealer, Richard Griffiths as Harry\'s unpleasant uncle, and most of all Alan Rickman with a sinisterly villainous performance of Gothic dread - nobody can be a bad guy like Rickman can. Cameos from the likes of Julie Walters, Fiona Shaw, Zoe Wanamaker, and even Warwick Davis (which surely had to be a step up from LEPRECHAUN 5 or whatever his last film was) as a goblin are endless and a delight.HARRY POTTER AND THE PHILOSOPHER\'S STONE may be a kid\'s film, but there\'s enough going on here to make it an enjoyable viewing experience for adults who plan to watch the film with their kids as well. Lots of plot, interesting and original characters, refreshingly old-fashioned moral codes, some fine sets which skilfully mix old and new-style worlds, an effective score, special effects which seamlessly blend in with the story and above average acting help to make this a gem of a movie and a cut above the rest.', 'This movie captures most aspects of the book perfectly. Being the first in the franchise, it has to do a lot of world building. But the writers and the director of this movie managed to keep things simple and to the point.The cast is also perfect. All the younger actors were good enough and they keep improving with each movie. The older cast was amazing in their roles and help the movie feel more real. The music of John Williams was a masterpiece and added to the magical nature of the story.Even after 2 decades, this movie still feels magical and captures the attention of many young and old audience.', ""Cool! I'm so sorry because in 21 years of my life, I've only seen a movie as cool as this. Harry potter, in my first impression, I was amazed and curious about how the next series of this film will be. Watching this film evokes a feeling of dark academia that was buried in the past. Even though this film was produced in 2001, but the quality is quite good and even not inferior to films produced now."", 'Lord Voldemort, an evil and powerful dark wizard, has just been defeated. When he tried to kill a one-year-old boy, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), the killing curse rebounded upon him, destroying his body. Harry is left an orphan with a lightning-bolt scar on his forehead, Voldemort having killed his parents, Lily (Geraldine Somerville) and James (Adrian Rawlins) Potter. Professors Dumbledore (Richard Harris) and McGonagall (Dame Maggie Smith) and Gamekeeper Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) leave him on the doorstep of his ultra-conventional, insensitive, negligent Muggle (non-magical) relatives, the Dursley family, who take him in. Harry\'s relatives decide to conceal his magical heritage from him and make him live in a cupboard under the stairs for ten years.Shortly before Harry\'s eleventh birthday, he receives a letter addressed specifically to him. His outraged uncle, however, reads and burns it before Harry has a chance to look at the contents. The sender does not give up, and the Dursleys receive successively larger numbers of the same correspondence. Soon, his Uncle Vernon (Richard Griffiths) becomes so paranoid that the Dursleys, with Harry in tow, hide in a hut on a small island to escape. That night (which happens to be before Harry\'s birthday), he is visited by an enormous man named Hagrid who bursts through the locked door of the hut. With Hagrid holding the Dursleys at bay, Harry finally reads his letter, in which he learns he has been invited to study magic at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The next day Harry and Hagrid head to Diagon Alley in London (the secret magical location hidden behind the famous wizarding pub The Leaky Cauldron). Harry enters the wizarding world for the first time, learns to his surprise that he is famous, and meets the new Hogwarts Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Professor Quirrell (Ian Hart). Hagrid takes Harry to Gringott\'s Bank, where Harry learns that he is quite wealthy. Following this, Hagrid stops at a different vault to retrieve a small, wrapped parcel for Dumbledore. Using his newfound money, Harry buys everything he requires for his first school year, including and owl, and a wand. Interestingly, the wand that chooses him is the brother wand of the one that was used to kill Harry\'s parents and give him the scar. He then takes the train to Hogwarts from Platform Nine and three-quarters, befriending Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), and meeting Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), a Muggle-born witch.Upon arrival, the Sorting Hat places Harry, Ron and Hermione in Gryffindor House. Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton), an arrogant and elitist student, gets placed in Slytherin. At the end of their first week at Hogwarts, Harry and Ron discover that Gringotts, the wizarding bank, was broken into and a vault that Harry and Hagrid visited had been the subject of the robbery. Later, Harry discovers he has a talent for riding broomsticks, and after an incident with Malfoy, is recruited to join Gryffindor\'s Quidditch team as a Seeker, much to Malfoy\'s displeasure.Harry, Ron, Hermione explore Hogwarts late at night and accidentally stumble across the door to a corridor. A three-headed dog, christened Fluffy by Hagrid, guards a trapdoor. On Halloween, Quirrell informs everyone that a troll has entered the castle; Harry and Ron fight the troll to save Hermione, who is trapped in the girls\' bathroom, and the three become best friends.At Harry\'s first Quidditch match, Harry\'s broom becomes possessed, nearly knocking him off. Hermione sees Professor Severus Snape (Alan Rickman), the sinister Potions master and head of Slytherin House, staring at Harry and mouthing words, making her believe that Snape has caused the broom to misbehave with a dark curse. Hoping to save Harry, Hermione sets Snape\'s robes on fire, distracting him and others and allowing Harry to survive.At Christmas, Harry receives an Invisibility Cloak, once belonging to his father, which renders its wearer invisible. Harry uses it to explore the Restricted Section in the library to research information on Nicolas Flamel, a name Hagrid lets slip when confronted about his knowledge of Fluffy. Eventually, Harry learns that ""Nicolas Flamel is the only known maker of the Sorcerer\'s Stone, which produces the Elixir of Life which will make the drinker immortal.""Harry sees Snape trying to get information from Quirrell about getting past Fluffy; Quirrell says he does not know what he\'s talking about. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are sure that Snape is trying to steal the Sorcerer\'s Stone in order to restore Lord Voldemort to power, but Hagrid denies it. While at Hagrid\'s hut, the trio discover a dragon egg Hagrid was nursing in a fire. Later the egg hatches a Norwegian Ridgeback dragon, and Hagrid decides to call him ""Norbert"". The friends are nervous for Hagrid, since dragon breeding had long been outlawed in the wizarding world, and Hagrid had something of a reckless nature, who has long since nursed a strong desire for a dragon. Finally, Harry, Ron, and Hermione are able to convince Hagrid to let Norbert go live with other dragons of his kind in Romania.Harry, Hermione, Ron and Draco are caught out late at night, and are forced to serve detention with Hagrid in the Forbidden Forest. Harry sees a hooded figure drink the blood of an injured unicorn, which makes Harry\'s forehead scar start burning. Firenze, a centaur, tells Harry that it is a monstrous thing to slay a unicorn, let alone drink its blood. He also tells Harry that unicorn blood will keep one alive, and that the hooded figure is in fact Voldemort.Harry, Hermione and Ron find out that Hagrid has told a hooded stranger how to get past Fluffy, and they believe the theft of the Stone is imminent. Rushing to finally confide in Professor Dumbledore their news, they meet Professor McGonagall, who is shocked to find out how much they knew about the Stone, but reassures them all the same that it is safe in the castle. She also tells them that Dumbledore has been sent away on an important mission by the Ministry of Magic. Positive that Dumbledore\'s summons was a red herring to take Professor Dumbledore away from Hogwarts, the trio make plans to thwart Snape\'s theft of the stone. They set out to reach the stone first, navigating the security system set up by the school\'s staff, which is a series of complex magical challenges. The three make it through together until finally, Harry must enter the inner chamber alone. There he finds that Professor Quirrell, not Snape, is attempting to steal the Stone. Realizing that Snape was trying to protect him from harm all along, Harry confronts Quirrell and survives a second encounter with Lord Voldemort, who has possessed Quirrell and appears as a ghastly face on the back of Quirrell\'s head. Quirrell crumbles when he touches Harry\'s skin, and Harry passes out because of his close proximity to Lord Voldemort. Voldemort then pitilessly abandons Quirrell, who dies in the aftermath of his possession.Harry wakes up in the hospital wing. Dumbledore reveals to Harry that Harry\'s mother died to protect Harry as an infant. Her pure, loving sacrifice provides Harry with an ancient magical protection from Voldemort\'s lethal spells and also prevents Voldemort from touching Harry without suffering terribly. Dumbledore also says that the Sorcerer\'s Stone has been destroyed to prevent future attempts by Voldemort to steal it.Finally, at the end-of-year feast, the House Points totals are given: Gryffindor is in last place. However, Dumbledore gives a few ""last-minute additions"", granting points to Harry, Ron, Hermione and Neville for their bravery and service towards school, so that Gryffindor wins the House Cup. Harry returns to the Dursleys for the summer, happy to finally have a real home in Hogwarts.']"
55,Wizarding World,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,295297,"[""Prepare yourself for a darker fantasy this time with some harrowing and scary special effects. Apparently J.K. Rowling has hit upon the fact that kids love to be scared stiff along with being entertained by touches of humor and excitement--although I think her imagination works overtime on scenes like the vomiting fit for Ron, one of the more tasteless sequences.And apparently the makers of this Potter film have met the challenge of providing spiders and snakes that are hideous enough to have Ron and the audience in a fit of hysterics. It's all here--the main events anyway of the Rowling book--and for extra measure they've given a much needed humorous role to Kenneth Branagh who has great fun with his role as the self-loving Gilderoy Lockhart. The only real drawback is that Maggie Smith has very little to do--but the main chores belong to Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint who continue to charm as the three leads. Jason Isaacs as Lucius Malfoy has a commanding presence and an amusingly wicked final scene involving the computer created Dobby who steals every scene he's in.Should keep Potter fans happy--and for a movie two-and-a-half hours long it moves along at a brisk pace from one adventure to another with what by now appears to be mechanical skill, thanks to artful direction by Chris Columbus who knows how to keep this sort of thing moving. John Williams' perky score is a distinct help."", 'Having three daughters I have a choice when a great book comes out: buy three of them (EXPENSIVE!!), force someone to wait until the other is done before they can read the book (sure, I enjoy breaking up fights!), or read it to them. I chose to read it to them so we could ALL enjoy it...and we did! Naturally, the kids were excited when the movie came out. However, when I saw the first Harry Potter, I was terrified it was going to be ""butchered"" like most ""books to movies"" are; but was pleasantly surprised by the relatively ""stick to the book"" script it displayed. Sure, some things were left out undoubtedly due to time constraints, but overall, it conveyed the story well.Chamber of Secrets did this even better.As an avid reader, I am quite hesitant to see my beloved books displayed on screen only to have the directors do them no justice. However, with both Harry Potter movies, the visuals were spectacular, the acting well done, and the characters almost perfectly matched. The set design for Diagon Alley and the Weasley house was fabulous! How wonderful to see these places come to life outside of our imaginations! This stays true for nearly every aspect of Hogwarts...from the greenhouse, to the moving staircases, the dorms and Dumbledore\'s office. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson do superb jobs of playing Harry, Ron, and Hermione. The movie undoubtedly draws you in and makes you forget that this isn\'t real...quite an acheivement!Of course, not all moviegoers will enjoy this one. It is not for the die-hard action fan, the horror-only fans, or those that dislike a bit of magic, imagination, and fantasy. But for the rest of us, Chamber of Secrets accurately depicts what until now, only our imaginations could see. Children will love this for the wizardry and magic, the struggle between Harry and his foes, the friendships that abound, and the simple fun of it all; while adults will love it for bringing them back to a time when magic was, indeed, real.All in all, I give this a 5 out of 5...fantastically done. Of course, I would have liked to see a bit more scenes from the book added, but I understand time restrictions. Great film and a definite must see!', 'This movie is way better than the first one, which everyone is saying because--let\'s face it--it\'s true. The three leads have grown into their characters, and their acting is loads better. I kept thinking during the first one, ""Aw, look at these cute little kids playing Harry, Ron and Hermione."" Now they ARE Harry, Ron and Hermione, though they still won\'t get any Oscar nods. All the new characters were absolutely wonderful. I was not disappointed at all with a single one, even Dobby. Now, I know a lot of people compare him to another CGI character, but he\'s not like that at all. I loved Dobby, even though when I saw him the trailers I thought I was going to hate him. Jason Isaacs as Malfoy was an absolute slime ball, and just so deliciously evil. Not bad looking, either, especially with his luscious long blonde hair. Bonnie Wright returned as Ginny Weasley, who had a much more important part and did an excellent job, I was very impressed. I\'m tempted to go on about the lovely Christian Coulson as Tom Riddle, and Kenneth Branaugh, who embodies Gilderoy Lockhart on the screen, but this review has a word limit. Even if you are not a massive Harry Potter fan, you will find this movie very enjoyable. It\'s scary (spiders, snakes, and willows, oh my!) and incredibly funny, thanks to Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley) and of course Kenneth Branaugh, the incredibly pompous new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. Back to the subject of the three leads, Daniel Radcliffe (Harry), Rupert Grint (Ron), and Emma Watson (Hermione). They have grown quite a bit since the last film, though it\'s not a bad thing-Harry and his friends are supposed to grow too. Girls are starting to notice how good-looking Harry has become, and Ron, who is still adorable, and Hermione is becoming very pretty. I was pleased to see that her appearance was more like it was described in the books-she even had big teeth. Ron is finally taller than the other two like he\'s supposed to be, but that\'s most likely due to Rupert being older. I only had one disappointment as a major Potter fan-Sean Biggerstaff. While I believe he is absolutely dreamy and am in love with him, he just didn\'t come across as the mad, maniacal Wood we\'ve grown to love. A consolation for some of the die-hard fans who might find the movie a little fast when they first see it-see it twice. The second time is so much more enjoyable, I can\'t tell you why, but you\'ll love it. I\'d recommend this movie to anyone, from the scary gothic kid who sits next to me in fourth period to my work-a-holic father, it\'s great. I can\'t wait to see it again with my mother, who was away this weekend. I\'ve already seen it twice, and it\'s only been out for three days. I can guarantee that you\'ll enjoy it, even if you didn\'t like the first one-which I personally find odd, but slightly understandable. Slightly. Go see Chamber of Secrets!', 'Chris Columbus said he wanted to make a 2,5 hour movie that feels like 30 Minutes. Well, in my case he surely succeeded! I saw the movie as a member of the press and couldn\'t get enough of it. I would have gladly sat in the cinema for another two or three hours with a biiiig smile on my face.Like part one, ""chamber of secrets"" stays true to the book. I don\'t know about you - but I HATE it when movie makers change the storylines, add or remove characters and do it for the ""sake of the art"". I think they do it because they are too lazy to create their own storys, so they rip off other peoples ideas and crush them to make it more comfortable... If a book is loved by millions of readers there must be a good reason for that. Chris Columbus has captured the essence of the book on screen. So, after ""philosophers stone"" he delivered again!When reading the book I always envisioned Michael Crawford playing Gilderoy Lockhart. His broad smile and clumsiness à la Frank Spencer would have been perfect for the role. But instead we get to see Kenneth Branagh, so of course you won\'t see ME complain. The great find of the movie is Jason Isaacs as Lucius Malfoy. In his short scenes onscreen he makes your blood freeze. And again: all the casting is brilliant. Every character just feels right - even if you imagined something different when you read the book. There also has been talk about the young actors getting older. Well, let me remind you that this also happens in the books. In every book Harry Potter and his friends are one year older. So there\'s no excuse to take the roles away from Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint. I couldn\'t imagine someone else playing their parts.Go see ""the chamber of secrets"". It\'s pure fun and excitement! And it will wet your appetite for more to come. Richard Harris couldn\'t have asked for a better movie and legacy to be remembered by.', ""The second installment seems to carry on where the first left off. All previous characters return and then some!! The grandiose majesty of Harry Potter continues with new tricks, new delights and little treats that can be taken for granted. At times I find the Harry Potter world has so many wonderful things happening at the same time that you tend to overlook the smaller things (ergos the Weasley's residence and the great Hall) The Chamber of Secrets is a darker tail but is well within the tolerances of most children's ability to handle. The creatures are excellent, the overall story is easy enough to follow, though some aspects have to be explained to younger children.What does get annoying is that constant overused Daniel Radcliffe cheesy smile. It wears on the sensibilities after a while like sharp finger nails scraping down a blackboard. Overall though, Chamber of Secrets is a solid good natured magical movie only slighter less pleasing than the first."", ""If you liked the first one then you're going to love this! There's a darker atmosphere this time around and more characters are introduced including Gilderoy Lockhart (hilariously played by Kenneth Branagh), Draco Malfoy's father, Lucius (a great performance by Jason Isaacs, exactly how I imagined the character from the books!), Ron's father, Arthur, and the mysterious Dobby the house elf (fortunately he isn't anywhere near as annoying as other CG characters in other movies, but I won't name any names... *cough*JarJarBinks*cough*)The movie sticks closely to the novel, but as in the last movie we miss some of those scenes where we start to learn a little more about the characters, especially the hate-hate relationship between Harry and Professor Snape (who was seriously underused in this movie!)All in all it's definitely worth checking out, the running time of 160 minutes may seem a little long but it doesn't seem that long when you're watching it. By the way, whatever you do DO NOT leave until the credits have ended, otherwise you'll miss a little extra treat..."", 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a huge step on from the first film. In the Philosophers stone we were introduced to the the world of Harry Potter and given a taster of what lies ahead. In the Chamber of Secrets the main story line for the series of books really starts to be told. It is much darker and sinister than the first film and Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint give good performances and give us a glimpse of the fine actors they are becoming.Kenneth Branagh and Jason Isaacs are perfectly cast as Gilderoy Lockhart and Lucius Malfoy and truly bring the characters from the book to life. Mark Williams as Arthur Weasley while under used in this film is going to be great in the next few as his character has more to do. The Cinematography is again superb and somehow the Quiddich game is better than in the first film. A fine sequal to the first film and should dispel any notion that the first one was just a one hit wonder. A firm 10 in my book.', 'Lessons learned since the 1st film! Clearly this film was edited at script stage rather than the cutting room floor stage!! This story reads as film narrative, rather than a book illustration, which was the big mistake of the 1st film. Anyone can watch this film and follow it without knowing the book. The 1st hour is pure laugh out loud fun (the adults in my Cinema audience were shouting with laughter!). The last hour is scary, wand dropping tension.The problem is: how do we convince muggles put-off by the 1st film to go see this one? Why should they give this one a chance? Answer: If you know someone who likes Fun, make them see this film! This film is not about \'Oscars\' & Acting, despite the fabulous performances by all the adults, it is about enjoying the overall effect of the film, this being to give the viewer a long lasting buzz. Brilliant! The staging is very theatrical in it\'s minimalism, yet extravagantly arty in visual specifics. In the not to distant future I see fans going to a regular weekend slot at their local cinema for Audience Participation fun. Wands, swords, sorting hat, spiders, mandrakes & crucial ear muffs as standard props! Lots of gaps for us to shout out funny quips. A Rocky Horror Show Audience Participation Show for kids! Long overdue.My Rating: 8/10. Not a masterpiece of cinematic potential, but such jolly good fun that no one should be denied the joy of a ""Bloody Marvelous"" frolic. A film for the child within us adults. Go see it with a predominantly adult audience if you want to experience the real buzz of unfettered emotion. Only three children were present at the Preview I witnessed and they were silently spellbound whereas the adults evoked emotion noisily throughout and then stood up, cheered and applauded at the end! I shall never forget this truly magical experience. Richard Harris you can not be replaced, you will always be Dumbledore, and hence Omnipresent. Thank you for the fantastic finale to a wonderful life that you gave us. Thank you. And Thank you JK & Chris. You did it, the Chamber is well & truly open now!', ""Having done a good job with the first Harry Potter flick, one shouldn't be surprised Chris Columbus was asked to direct the sequel as well. And the second film actually improves on its predecessor, getting a little edgier and less children-friendly (two factors that raise exponentially with each new installment), even though it does repeat an old mistake in certain places.So, what about the plot? Well, it's Harry's (Daniel Radcliffe) second year at Hogwarts, and everything should be fine, given he defeated Voldemort in the previous film and there are no other threats lurking in the magical world. Or are there? A mysterious house elf named Dobby seems to think so, as he repeatedly tries to prevent Harry from returning to school and keeps asking him to leave when students start being attacked by a supernatural, unknown foe. All this seems to be connected to the Chamber of Secrets, but that isn't of much help, especially considering the new Defense against the Dark Arts teacher, famous writer Gilderoy Lockhart (Kenneth Branagh), is a complete idiot.Darker and faster, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets repeats the Philosopher's Stone's mistake of being slightly too faithful to the literary source, but Columbus manages to compensate this flaw with better visuals, some really creepy set-ups and improved acting from the younger cast members (Emma Watson in particular). He has also made interesting choices when it comes to the new faces in the adult group: Branagh is very, very funny as the ego-fueled Lockhart (a role originally intended for Hugh Grant), but the most interesting addition is Jason Isaacs (whom I can't wait to see again in the fourth film) as Lucius Malfoy, an intriguingly sinister wizard who is as racist and arrogant as his son, Harry's arch-nemesis Draco. As for Dobby, a CG creature voiced by Toby Jones, he is interesting at first but rapidly becomes annoying, his masochistic antics being repetitive and a little dull.Finally, a special mention for Chamber's best element: Richard Harris, who sadly passed away a few weeks before the movie's premiere. He was, and is, incredibly good as headmaster Dumbledore and despite a worthy replacement (Michael Gambon), in the purists' hearts he will always be the one and only greatest wizard of all time.Verdict: good, but they could have done better. Thankfully, they did with number three..."", 'Not being a fan of the Harry Potter Movies, I toddled along to the first showing of this movie at my local UGC Cinema and sat down and thirly enjoyed this movie, but not in the way that I would enjoy something like the Lord of The Rings or Spider-Man. Of course Harry Potter\'s target audience is of a younger age so I can see how I might not have enjoyed it as much as a slightly younger audience, but to say the least it is a lot better than some of the crap that is fizzled out these days. Crap this is not and a year on the main characters are a lot older, taller and voices broken. Many of the original cast return and a few new characters appear in this such as Kenneth Branagh and Jason Isaacs. Kenneth Branagh plays a wonderful part of Gilderoy Lockhart who seems to think he\'s adored by all and quite frankly he is adored by women for his charm and bravery. He was one of the better bits in the movie as was Jason Isaacs who played Lucius Malfoy father of Draco. Jason sports a nice long wig and plays the evil father/villian down to a T. He plays it much like his villian in The Patriot. I was sometimes phased by Rupert Grint\'s ""Ron"". He isn\'t that great an actor, but he could play his part satisfactory. He could have done better, but then again I have not read the book so I would not know how Ron would have behaved. I guess the scenes he played a scary person (which was quite a lot) in weren\'t convincing enough for me, but kids should get a good laugh out of him more than I did. I suppose you can\'t hold it against the kids who aren\'t up to par because they\'re just young and learning the actors trade, but for those who play their part well they should get a pat in the back. The SFX were impressive, especally the character of Dobby. He was well great. I couldnt tell he was CG by his bad creation, but through the fact there was no way they could have done it otherwise. In fact the CG character of Dobby is very similar looking to Gollum in Lord of The Rings and the CG Asgard in television series Stargate SG-1 (speaking of textures) which which speaks well for Stargate SG-1 if it can do just as good as a top movie like this...and top it is. The CG Spiders were incredibly creepy and realistic looking. Not being too scared of Spiders, they kind of made me jump. I felt by body tense up as the gave case to Harry and Ron, which is a good thing because not often do I find myself doing this in movies. The person I had sat beside seemed pretty scared of the spiders as well. John Williams score was very much like his original score with old themes returning and some of the music sounding like music from his Indiana Jones scores. I found myself whistling the main theme of Harry Potter for most of the night and on occasion not realizing I was doing it until someone else pointed it out to me. This movie certainly had better action sequences and a lot more action geared than The 1st Potter movie. I found myself clenching up at points as they were really tense. The story wasn\'t too difficult to understand from a non-potter-fan point of view and the film was a lot shorter than I expected. I had thought it ran for three hours when it was more like 2 1/2. In some cases I found that you had to have seen the 1st movie to understand some of what was going on, but that was mainly due to the back story of he who shall not be uttered and some of the gags. The only thing that annoyed me was that the cues in the Foyer were too long and I couldnt get an ice cream and there was some little toddler crying down the front row for a few minutes mid-way. Why bring a toddler who\'s going forget about the film by next week? You may ask this yourself. If you\'re not a mad-potter-fan then I would suggest you wait a few weeks so that you\'re not over run with humans who stand 4 feet tall...ie. CHILDREN! (I\'m not talking about Dwarves)I\'d give it 8.5/10. But I am not a huge fan of these movies and I am not the target audience. That\'s a good thing in case you were wondering.', 'A lot has been made about the pubescence of the three leads in this new Harry Potter installment and it is a bit disconcerting when Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) speak their first lines in those awkward cracks of pre-adolescence. However, their growing up, along with the physical blossoming of their friend Hermione (the perky and smart actress Emma Watson) seem mark a general growing up of the whole Harry Potter series. This one is more for grown-ups: the first one hooked the kid demographic and no doubt they will still be enraptured by ""Chamber of Secrets."" This is the film, however, that hopes to attract a whole new audience in the parents of those kids. It is darker and has more layers. The explanations about wizardry are less cursory and the acting seems stronger.I have never read the books so I bring an outlook to the films that is free of personal bias toward the quality of the adaptation or the faithfulness to Rowling\'s words. One thing this film does do, that the first one did not, is it made me want to read the books. I was more drawn in, in a literary sense, to the world, to the stories, and particularly to the characters. Whereas the first film was a passable introduction to everything Harry Potter is about, this seems like a deeper riff on some of the same themes that the first one only glossed over.However, I might not have enjoyed Chamber of Secrets as thoroughly if I had not first seen Sorcerer\'s Stone. It gave me (and Chris Columbus\' production team) a framework that invited expansion. Without the background of the first film, I might not have been as emotionally invested in Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), or have understood the mechanics of ""Quidditch,"" or even have cared about the tenuous future of Hogwarts School for Wizards.In a word, the performances are ""marvelous."" I read somewhere that Rowling wrote with a Dickensian sense of character and that seems to carry over to the film. Robbie Coltrane as the affable Hagrid is still my favorite. Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman are woefully underused in this film but I can only hope they will resurface in the others; they can still steal their scenes with the tiniest pursing of the lips or eye flickers. (As a side note: Outside of Coltrane\'s Hagrid, I find Rickman\'s Professor Snape the most interesting and multi-layered character across both films). Richard Harris is suitably noble and wily in one of his last roles. And Kenneth Branagh, as the egomaniacal new Hogwarts professor and author of wizardry books, is perfectly cast and very funny. One thing this film does is allow room to explore these characters in a full sense and give the audience time to get under their skin.Chris Columbus has been called a tactless director and I can see where some of his scenes, particularly the action ones, are played so broadly that they lose all semblance of meaning. He is not particularly adept at handling the young actors, who come across as pretty bland and uninteresting (Rupert Grint as Ron is sort of annoying, overplaying the stuff that was likeable at first). Likewise, he is unable to invigorate some of the scenes (the car scenes, the spider scene, and even the final encounter between Harry and the Chamber of Secrets\' monster) come off as overlong and particularly flat. The running time of 2 hours and 41 minutes is a bit exorbitant: To me it just suggests that Columbus doesn\'t have the necessary audacity to deviate too much from Rowling\'s source material. I know that he has to maintain a certain level of faithfulness to the books but, to be honest, what is exciting on the page does not always translate well onscreen. Perhaps Alfonso Cuaron, slated to direct the new film, will have a better, snappier sense of how to energize the action scenes without losing the obvious positives of sticking to the novels.However, the movie did energize me enough to want to go and read the books. The scope, the palette of, yes, Dickensian characters, and the intertwining of stories makes me want to see how Rowling fits it all together. Then maybe I\'ll be able to talk more intelligently about faithfulness when Cuaron releases `Prisoner of Azkaban.\' Maybe I\'ll undergo a massive reading program this holiday season.', ""SPOILERS!!!Why is it that, whenever a book is made into a movie, everyone complains about scenes that are ommitted, no matter how superfluous they may be?i have had to listen to people complain about the fact that the Deathday party was not in the movie, or the Valentine's dwarves, or the garden gnomes.....COME ON people! while these scenes are cute, they are not pertinent....!and OF COURSE they spent more time in the Quidditch match and Basilisk fight than Rowling did in the book! these are the action scenes that the kids love, and i personally thought the slytherin match was incredible....face it people, whenever a book is made into a movie, things have to be cut...it's a factand you better get over it soon! if they expect to keep making each book into its own movie, come the fourth book, there will have to be MAJOR ommissions....all that being said, i wish the bonus DVD scenes had been included in the theatrical release, particularily the Malfoys in the dark arts shop, and (especially) the Lockhart first class quiz....CLASSIC!don't let anyone fool you....this is a VERY enjoyable movie....the casting, as was the case in the first film, was perfect..(Malfoy Senior might be the greatest casting decision in the history of film)....Dobby (my biggest worry going in) was well done...the pacing is great, the acting fine, and the effects are incredible....of course, it goes without saying that you should read the books first, as they are delightful....but both movies so far have done them justice....9/10"", 'I thought this was better than the first Harry Potter movie because it didn\'t overdo the action scenes as the first film did, and the special-effects were better. It\'s not ""Lord Of The Rings,"" of course, but it\'s still decent entertainment, even for us older folks. It got even better with the third installment, which has been my personal favorite of the four I\'ve seen now.I don\'t buy into all the occult baloney and black magic stuff, just enjoying the special-effects that go with it with these stories. It also was interesting to see how the three young stars - Daniel Radcliff (""Harry""), Emma Watson (""Hermione"") and Rupert Grint (""Ron"") have physically matured since the first movie. All of a sudden, the boys have reached puberty and their voices are changing. ""Ron"" squeaks half the time he talks!As with many modern-day, big-budget films, the visuals, the special-effects and the surround sound are all astounding. Definitely entertaining for all ages with no worries about language.', ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is superb, and don't listen to those narrow-minded critics who claim otherwise. Those who said it is superior to the first film are right: Philosopher's Stone was wonderful but the sequel does for Harry Potter what the Empire Strikes Back did for Star Wars - elevate it to a higher level where it will be regarded as a masterpiece in it's own right.The plot is tighter and 'cleaner' then the first film, and runs along at a pace brisk enough to sweep the two-hours away with the wave of a wand. The acting from Daniel Radcliffe was criticised by some in the first film and still others are bleating on about him now. Give it a rest, say I. He was excellent.Hogwarts itself really comes to life, largely due to the camera shots sweeping in through a window or over the castle - it feels a lot more 'rounded' and the Quidditch match benefits from a makeover and improved SFX.Unlike some other fantasy films the CGI is not over used and doesn't smother the screen.If you've read other reviews you'll know Kenneth Branagh is wonderful as Lockhart (and you have to stay to the end credits to see what happens to him)Jason Isaacs is great as Lucius Malfoy, and overall the film is scarier and darker then the first film, and there is a very touching moment involving Hermione and Ron which was performed with wonderful understatement by Rupert and Emma.Throughout the whole 2 hours I don't think I stopped smiling. The Whomping Willow, the flying car, the duel between Draco and Harry - every scene was a joy to behold.To those critics who keep on comparing Potter to Lord of the Rings and finding the former wanting (one person even laughingly suggested Christopher Columbus was ripping it off)bear in mind that Philospher's Stone is the second biggest film of all time behind Titanic - beating Rings. I use this only to illustrate the popularity and success of Harry Potter, as so many people seem to find it inferior. I for one was left cold by Rings and was thoroughly bored by it - it was the least magical fantasy film I had ever seen. Give me Harry Potter any day.Anyone who rates this film poorly (comparing it to Rings no doubt as they always do) has no sense of adventure, no sense of humour, and -most importantly - no sense of wonder.So put that in your cauldron and boil it!"", '""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" is, unfortunately, not one of the best Harry Potter movies despite (or perhaps because of) sticking relatively closely to J.K. Rowling\'s original novel (IMHO one of the better in the series). Some parts feel overlong and others too short, and there are signs that director Chris Columbus was growing fatigued in his second (and final) entry in the series.Overall I think we have a good fantasy film here. Other than Rupert Grint\'s Ron (Grint\'s whole range of facial expressions seem to consist of scrunching up his face in a Spielbergian ""ewwwww"" pose) the young actors were growing well into their roles, and the new adult performers are excellent. Kenneth Branagh is well-cast as the pompous celebrity wizard Guilderoy Lockhart, hired as the kids\' second ""Defense Against the Dark Arts"" professor. The particular standout here is new cast member Jason Isaacs, who is the very image of petty evil as Lucius, the father of Potter\'s nemesis Draco Malfoy. Some parents might feel Lucius\' treatment of servant, the house-elf Dobby, is overly harsh but it introduces an important theme for the series. Contrary to what I\'m tempted to think the film producers would like, ""Harry Potter"" isn\'t just an action-fantasy story. This story introduces the important concept of ""mud-bloods"" (wizards with one or more non-wizard parent) and the theme of prejudice and bigotry shown by ""pure-blood"" wizards towards them.Other than that there\'s not that much to talk about. There\'s more Quiddich, more mystery and intrigue. This story has quite a few more horrific elements than the first, ranging from giant spiders to a spell that makes Ron vomit slugs. Hermione (Emma Watson) disappears for much of the film\'s running time under an evil spell, requiring Ron and Harry to think for themselves for once. The ending feels like a generic action scene in any Hollywood film, failing to capture the magic that the book did. Of course some of this is just the fault of actually being too close to the book. Dumbledore\'s phoenix clawing out the basilisk\'s eyes is an exciting concept but as a CGI on screen (particularly since they chose to make the phoenix awfully small) it just looks silly.One last word on the Gambon vs. Harris as Dumbledore controversy. Honestly as much as I respect Harris I just think he looked tired in this film and failed to capture the kind of energy that Dumbledore needs to have. Harris probably would have been an excellent Dumbledore if he had been healthy\x85 he\'s got all the screen presence that you need but none of the humor at this point in his career. I saw the first 4 movies before reading the books, and at first I felt Gambon was getting too goofy, losing the gravitas of the character. But after reading through the books I see that Gambon\'s performance is actually closer to what Rowling wrote. Harris\' wizard is a bit more of a generic wise authority figure, where Gambon catches more of the particular side of Dumbledore that is sometimes wreckless and can be disarmingly whimsical \x96 traits that make him seem less ""authoritative"" but certainly more human, and are of increasing importance in the 6th and 7th books.All in all, I would argue that this film (like most of the others in the series) functions very well as a companion to the book but not so well as a stand-alone film for those who haven\'t read the series. Speaking as one who has seen the film both before and after reading the books I guess I should know. It\'s not a bad film, especially for those familiar with the details of the story that are left out which add depth (but which are not contradicted by the film for the most part), but it was a wise choice of the producers to hire a new director for the 3rd (and IMHO best so far).', ""Not originally a fan of this series (really, not interested), I've got to say that I now see the widespread appeal of these Harry Potter movies! I actually first saw GOBLET OF FIRE (2005) when it premiered on cable the year after it's release and liked it enough to want to start watching this series. Then when ORDER OF THE PHOENIX (2007) came out 2 years later, I liked it, but it seemed to get really dark and serious more so than GoF and I really needed perspective in understanding the trajectory of these HP films. I went out and bought the 5-disc collection of SORCERER'S STONE, CHAMBER OF SECRETS, PRISONER OF AZBAKAN, GOBLET OF FIRE, and ORDER OF THE PHOENIX. It's apparent these films are purposefully getting darker as they move along, some staying very true to the source material, some taking liberties.Of the 5-disc set, I actually think this film, CHAMBER OF SECRETS, may be the best! I still like the other 4 for different reasons, but here's some reasons why I rate this one so high: *Daniel Radcliffe, as Harry Potter, improved immensely from the first film to this one! In SS, you could really tell the 12-year old youngster was a bit nervous and awestruck at having to carry the load of this franchise on his shoulders! Radcliffe, while adorably cute along with his co-stars Rupert Grint (Ron) and Emma Watson (Hermione) in SS, really needed to step it up in CoS and he did in spades! In CoS, 13-year old Radcliffe obviously established that he IS Harry Potter! *The film's length is not a bother! When a film this long (over 2 1/2 hours?) can sustain itself and hold your attention without ever devolving into boredom or tedium, that is saying something! Especially when it's led by 3 kids! Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson deserve all praise! *Kenneth Branagh's delightfully fun performance as new Defense Against the Dark Arts Prof. Gilderoy Lockhart! This is the role that gets changed from film to film and Branagh's Lockhart is probably the best! *Christian Coulson as 16-year old Tom Riddle! This young actor was my favorite villain in all the films, even over Voldemort!...Uh, don't worry, I know what the big surprise was at the climax! Still, young Riddle was such an elegant, charming, devious, cold sort that I couldn't help but be enthralled by his commanding presence.*The climactic showdown between Harry and Tom was suspenseful and epic! Who'd have thought a scene between two teenagers would be as involving, deep, and exciting as any showdown between two adults? And they used words as weapons just as much as action and never sounded preachy or boring! An accomplishment indeed! *Of course, the adult cast the late great Richard Harris (Prof. Dumbledore, played by Michael Gambon in the later films), Maggie Smith (Prof. McGonagall), Alan Rickman (Prof. Snape), and Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid) carry their loads in professional, brilliant fashion and allow the young actors to have their shining moments. Jason Isaacs was a great addition as Lucius Malfoy, a new foil for Harry Potter and the father of little Draco Malfoy (reliably malevolent Tom Felton, who has played the role since the beginning with his contemporaries Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson).*Moaning Myrtle! Special mention also goes to Shirley Henderson as the newly introduced character in this film. A great comic relief (but still essential to the plot) character! CoS is the one Harry Potter film where one can say that it follows the source material AND does not bore the viewer!"", 'I really liked the first movie, and I think I like this one more. It\'s certainly both darker and funnier than the first. This time though, Ron gets the most laughs(""OK can we panic now?""). Here we get introduced to new characters, the standout being Kenneth Branagh, a Shakespeare veteran, who stole every scene as Gildaroy Lockhart. I loved it when he said ""It\'s filthy down here,"" the whole cinema were in hysterics at that. Jason Isaacs was menacing too, and Dobby was hilarious with his constant head-banging. Daniel Radcliffe is audibly older here and it does work at its advantage. I thought 23 year old Christian Coulson as Riddle was very good indeed, though Riddle was much scarier in the book. Other scenes of comic relief were provided by Ron\'s parents, played respectably by Julie Walters and Mark Williams. However, there were still some frightening scenes, and the plot at times seemed to be convoluted. Richard Harris was surprisingly good, considering he was ailing quite visibly, and some months later he sadly died. This movie is fairly faithful to the source material, and manages to have a bit of humour too. All in all, a dark and funny movie. 8/10 Bethany Cox', '""... The magical power that came to Joan Rowling from a different world, pulls for itself, and the book is read in one breath."" Book Review, December 18, 2000The second book about the adventures of the young wizard Harry Potter world waited impatiently. And finally, he waited. ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" appears before the reader\'s eyes with a bright and original work. Of course, it relies on the first book, but it remains individual. ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" - a darker and more terrible book, unlike the first. So became the film. But the film and the book have not lost their charm and easy immediacy. It\'s still the same kind of fairy tale about the fight between good and evil, where good will certainly win.The magical world of Harry Potter has not changed. All the same oblique streets of London, the splendor of Hogwarts, the Forbidden Forest with its secret inhabitants, The slanting alley, the eerie Lute Lane, the unfriendly Rattling Willow, the huge school yard, the stunning quidditch. All this was preserved and was moved by magic wave in the second film, only slightly transformed. Hogwarts is a bright and active participant in all events. This castle, which became home for Harry, is no less important character than our young hero. Hogwarts carries in itself tying knowledge and great wisdom. This huge, majestic building knew a lot in its time. And all its secrets, its architecture and attract the eye.In ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" we meet the amazing and frightening creatures of the magical world. Dobby\'s elf is very cute and funny. In such a small, frail body is hidden a wide soul, suffering in vain. He does his best to protect Harry from danger. But Harry Potter, like a magnet, attracts them. Favorite animal Hagrid turns into an unpleasant monster - a giant giant spider Aragog. He is wise, old, but does not inspire confidence. And on top of everything, the mighty, dangerous serpent Basilisk appears on the screen. There are many legends about this snake, and Joan Rowling decided to add it to her epic. And, in principle, not in vain. He inspires reverence and horror, but at the same time a frank desire for Harry to finish him off quickly. Another amazing character in the film is Phoenix Fawkes. Amazing bird flown from the pages of the book to the screen. She is an ancient mythical creature, dying and rising from the ashes. It reminds us of the eternal cycle of life and death. Special effects in the film, in other ways, as in the first, not at altitude. But even seeing a few implausible spiders and a snake, you believe everything that is happening on the screen. The magical, mysterious, magical and frankly amazing world of Harry Potter draws and you just do not want to return to reality. Chris Columbus, who became the director of the Potters for the second time, could not lose the charm and atmosphere of the first film. Just the movie ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" became more sinister, frightening and full of dangers.Characters have not changed. Bright, alive, emotionally embodied on the screen of their heroes magnificent English actors. The cold and tough Potions master Severus Snegg performed by Alan Rickman, the same adamant Minerva McGonagall, the wise director of the Hogwarts School Albus Dumbledore (the eternal memory of Richard Harris, who died three weeks before the premiere of the film), the kind-hearted forester Hagrid. Pleased with new characters. Lucius Malfoy performed by Jason Isaacs is cruel, adamant. It just blows something negative and extremely unpleasant. Zlatopust Lokons is the life-builder, reclining on the laurels of others. He turned out to be too sugary, pretty, I would even say sugary. And, undoubtedly, the actor Kenneth Bran is on top. His character, or rather his performance, is very ironic. The unchanged trio of the main characters remained the same. Harry Potter is the star of the magical world, the orphan boy, who grew up in disgusting muggles, displays remarkable courage, desperation and determination. The one with which courage he rushes into battle, you can just envy. I\'m torn by internal contradictions, his similarity with Lord Voldemort, his knowledge of the snake tongue. He is afraid of all this. And Harry desperately tries to understand himself. But when you need to become a hero, he is ready for this, because he is a hero in the full sense of the word. He is ready to give his own life for others. Is this not the highest manifestation of heroism? But Harry does not boast of it. And this is a huge plus to his character.""I\'m sure that Mr. Potter will always be there to save us."" - ""Certainly."" Lucius Malfoy and Harry Potter.Ron Weasley remained absolutely the same except for the character. He transformed, becoming better. His behavior towards Hermione, when she was insulted by Draco, calling her a Mudblood, his courage in the Forbidden Forest among not one hundred spiders, whom he fears until his death, causes respect and approval.Hermione Granger is still the same smart girl with a lively mind and a great intellect. She is very natural and sincerely wants to help others. With her character there are certain metamorphoses. Hermione clearly ceases to be such an avid guardian of order.""We are badly influenced by it."" Ron Weasley, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\'s Stone. Tom Narvolo Reddle is the past of the cruelest magician of the magical world of Lord Volan de Mort. This character is interesting with his striking resemblance to Harry. They are like halves of one whole. Harry has collected all the good and positive, in Voldemort everything is bad and negative. They are very similar, but they are very different. The choice. That\'s what makes Harry the way he is and distinguishes him from a dark magician. Choosing Harry to live the life he wants. His choice.""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" - a magical, mysterious, full of magic, amazing and terrible creatures canvas director Chris Columbus.

Definitely a must-see film, and much better than the first. It was a lot funnier, not to mention scarier! As expected, there were a few let downs when some of the funniest or important scenes were left out. However, you have to realize not everything that sounds brilliant in the book can be just as good on the screen. Never-the-less.....i strongly recommend it!!!! Role on The Prisoner Of Azkaban!', ""This beast of a film felt like it's writers and directors were drunk children and I love that!!!! The film's childish makers made this film truly magical and a spectacular sight to behold with unlimited creativity, this film has no limits, the characters feel invincible and gives the viewer a great special feeling of being invincible if they were on the sexy island known as Great Britain."", ""Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets is the type of movie that will be around forever. So far the two Harry Potter movies have been excellent movies in which spirit of the books by JK Rowling has been captured and expanded upon. Chamber of Secrets is about Harry Potter's (Daniel Radcliffe) second year in Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry and something is attacking the students. The fact that these students are of mixed parentage, one being a muggle(non-magical and the other being a witch or wizard) leads to a very unstable environment at Hogwarts. Directed by Chris Columbus and written by Steve Kloves this movie packed with the details that Rowling weaves throughout her book. The score by John Williams is excellent and well suited to the movie. Roger Pratt's cinematography is amazing. There is flashback to an earlier time at Hogwarts by way of a magical Diary that is brilliantly lit and shot in a sepia tone that looks just like the color of old paper. Kenneth Branagh gives a great performance that should have gotten more attention at award time. Jason Isaacs owns the role of the villainous Lucius Malfoy. His costuming and look are very well matched with that of Draco Malfoy, a nemesis of Harry's. Shirley Henderson as a ghost is also very good and steals her scenes. Returnees Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane, and in particular the late Richard Harris as Dumbledore are very good. Christian Coulson does a good job as the mysterious Tom Riddle. Daniel Radcliffe Emma Watson (Hermione) and Rupert Grint (Ron) are very good in this movie and have their characters down. Watson in particular is excellent. Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets in an underrated movie that is a must see."", ""With all the Character's in place and the world of Hogwarts so well established in the first movie, we get to concentrate more on the story this time around, and consequently, the story is has a little more substance to it.This time Harry is hearing strange voices around Hogwarts (These scenes are very well done, pretty eerie). Together with his friends he must find the reason for the mysterious Petrification of the residents of Hogwarts. After an Encounter with Aragog (A giant Spider) and a revelation that he is a Parsel Tongue (He can Talk to snakes) leading a lot of the students and Staff to believe Harry himself is causing these disturbances. He Finally Locates the Chamber of Secrets, a supposedly mythical Chamber hidden within the School. It is here he encounters the basilisk (a giant snake) for the final battle (a great scene.)Harrys second adventure is slightly better than his first, and at last we can see his potential.8/10"", ""The second in the Harry Potter franchise, 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets' was clearly intended for small children. While this approach did work with 'The Philosopher's Stone' as the happy, Disney -esque atmosphere reflected Harry's idealism of a wizarding world that was perfect, a slightly moody and mature tone would have been far more suitable for CoS since this is when our Boy Who Lived starts to realise the darker side of being a wizard and being a hero. In this film, twelve-year-old Harry is now in his Second Year at Hogwarts when the school is subjected to mysterious attacks that leave Muggleborn students incapacitated. Harry, Ron and Hermione quickly learn a creature is stalking the school, a monster that lives in a secret chamber and was once responsible for the death of a child.The quality of the child acting still leaves much to desired, with Rupert Grint and Tom Felton shining out above their weaker contemporaries. It is left to the adult cast to provide the solid performances, which they do to a marvellous degree. Maggie Smith as McGonagall and Alan Rickman as Snape seem born to play their roles, bringing their characters to life in a way the child actors just can't do. Kenneth Branagh is a treat as the conceited, campy Lockhart and the scenes where he and Rickman's Snape play each other off are the best in the film. Jason Issacs also deserves a mention since he was deliciously evil as Lucius Malfoy. He and Tom Felton not only look like father and son but in a minute-long scene they were able to portray Draco's hero-worship of his father and Lucius' impatience with his son.The main problem with the film is that it has been produced in a very dull, bland manner. Instead of focusing on Harry's uncomfortable realisation that the wizarding world has problems and his shock at how quickly the school turn against him at the barest of evidence, scriptwriter Steve Kloves and director Chris Columbus seem intent on making the film a magical version of an Enid Blyton boarding school where kids merrily skip around solving problems. The vain attempts to make the film threatening, such as the overly-long flying car scene (as if anyone thought Harry was going to fall out) and the trudge through the Forbidden Forest, are flat and weak. The final battle between Harry and his unmasked enemy are also lacklustre with no spontaneity and drag on for too long. Character development hasn't improved much either with Ron continuing to be dumbed down for comic relief while we have Hermione getting Ron and Dumbledore's lines (and in the case of the latter, it just sounds odd hearing words of wisdom said by an powerful, elderly wizard in the book being uttered by a child of twelve in the film).CoS also drops a number of points, in my mind, for the crass, cheesy overly-sentimentality of the ending. Steve Kloves must have been in Hollywood saccharine mode when he thought that pupils in British high schools would honestly clap for teachers (especially ones who have done nothing to warrant such praise) and kids hugging teachers in front of everyone. Harry would have been beaten up and bullied for being a boy of twelve who cuddles into his teacher like a wimpy little girl. And the preceding scene where Lucius confronts Harry was also cavity-inducing with the modest hero of the novels coming across as an arrogant, smug little brat. Kloves not only needs to re-read the book but he should spend more time with real kids at high school if this is how he thinks they conduct themselves.While CoS was enjoyable enough, it was still a mediocre take of the novel. It was evident that it was produced to keep little kids happy rather than a love for the series or to please the actual fans. I did like it but I still feel so envious of the LotR fans who get an epic film trilogy that matches up to the excellence of books and I wonder if HP will ever be that great."", 'I was one of those people that read Philosopher\'s Stone after I\'d seen the film. Enjoyed it so much I read the other three books, all excellent. Problem is though, because I\'d seen the film first, the pictures you conjure up in your mind while reading the other books all tend to follow the faces and locations that you have seen in the film, you simply adapt it to the new plots and locations. Chamber of Secrets is pretty much exactly as I pictured it when reading the book. In fact as the closing credits rolled I felt like I had seen it before...This isn\'t a criticism at all, the film-makers have done a great job of translating this book to the big screen, far more thoroughly than Philosopher\'s Stone. With this film there isn\'t too much that\'s left out. Whilst I know Chamber Of Secrets is gonna get (and is already getting) loads of fantastic reviews, I have to say I found it a bit flat. I thought the first film was great fun and quite magical, although I\'m afraid I disagree that the acting was great. Personally I thought the 3 children leads were pretty poor, especilly Emma Watson as Hermione (the way she delivers some lines made me cringe!) People often pass-off child performances as ""well they\'re only children"", but watch Natalie Portman in Leon or Haley Joel Osment to see quality child acting! Not much has changed here, although it is amusing to hear Harry and Ron with newly acquired broken voices... they\'ll be shaving next!Apart from a larger part for Richard Harris (excellent as Dumbledore - will be sadly missed), it seemed that Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid and the wonderful Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall hardly had any screen time in this one. Perhaps it was that way in the book, can\'t remember. Shame though...Was disappointed in the Quidditch match here. Being one of the best scenes in the first film, I expected a full-on assault for Chamber Of Secrets. We join the game towards the end, it consists mainly of Harry and Malfoy flying round and round underneath the seating stalls and is over way too quickly.Kenneth Branagh seemed a very strange choice for the hilarious Gilderoy Lockhart. I always imagined a character like Terry Thomas when reading the books. I never thought I\'d say this about Kenneth Branagh, but he actually seems to under-play the part (rather than wallop it with a sledgehammer like he usually does). One thing that did bug me... the sound-track. The Philosophers Stone was great. Another classic John Williams score. Problem is, rather than write a new score that kept the main spirit of the original (which John Williams did brilliantly in the Star Wars trilogy), they seemed to have lifted entire bits of music used in the first film, particularly the dramatic parts that you associate with a certain scene from Philosophers Stone, and transplanted it into Chamber Of Secrets! Couldn\'t help thinking... cheap... cheap... cheapThree of us went to see this film at a preview screening last night, and chatting afterwards we all felt basically the same way. Good film, good fun, but lacking the ""spark"" that made the first film so magical. Maybe because part of the fun of Philosopher\'s Stone was being introduced to this strange, quirky new world and its characters. In Chamber Of Secrets, we are now familiar with this so the story takes centre stage, and at the end of the day... it aint that strong.7/10', ""I love how close to the book the film actually is, and the sense of magic and wonder. It's a great children's fairytale."", 'While home with the Dursleys for the summer, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is not getting any mail from his friends, Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson). On his twelfth birthday (July 31) Harry is visited by Dobby, a house-elf, who warns Harry that he will be in mortal danger if he returns to Hogwarts. Harry ignores Dobby\'s warning and is determined to return. It turns out that Dobby has been collecting Harry\'s letters to make it seem as though his friends had forgotten him, hoping Harry might then not want to return to Hogwarts. Seeing that he will have to use force, Dobby decides to destroy, by the use of a charm, a large cake that Aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw) has baked for an important dinner party attended by Vernon Dursley\'s (Richard Griffiths) boss and his wife. Harry is blamed by the Ministry of Magic for Dobby\'s charm, and is told that if he does magic outside school again, he will be expelled. On learning that Harry cannot perform magic outside school, the Dursleys, previously fearful of his wizarding, lock Harrys books and wand away and Vernon Dursley fits bars onto his bedroom window, making Harry a prisoner.A few days later, Fred, George (James and Oliver Phelps) and Ron Weasley come to his rescue in their father\'s enchanted Ford Anglia. After a pleasant summer together in the Weasley house, everyone heads to Platform 9¾ to take the Hogwarts Express back to school. To their shock, Harry and Ron are unable to enter the barrier between platforms 9 and 10. In desperation, they fly to Hogwarts in the car, crashing into the Whomping Willow and damaging Ron\'s wand. The semi-sentient car ejects them and their belongings and disappears into the Forbidden Forest.Harry soon finds he is the unwanted centre of attention of three people: the vain new Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor, Gilderoy Lockhart (Kenneth Branagh), admirer Colin Creevey (Hugh Mitchell), and Ron\'s sister, Ginny Weasley (Bonnie Wright), who fancies Harry. Events take a turn for the worse when the Chamber of Secrets is opened and a monster stalks the castle, with the power literally to petrify several students. According to legend, the Chamber was built by Salazar Slytherin and can only be opened by his heir, in order to purge Hogwarts of students who are not pure-blood wizards. Many suspect Harry is the Heir of Slytherin, especially after he inadvertently speaks Parseltongue (the language of snakes), a rare ability Harry gained after Voldemort\'s murderous attack upon him when he was an infant.Harry, Ron, and Hermione attempt to discover the Heir of Slytherin\'s true identity. Using Polyjuice Potion brewed by Hermione, they disguise themselves as Slytherin students, Crabbe (Jamie Waylett) and Goyle (Josh Herman), hoping to learn from Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) the identity of the Heir. Malfoy, they learn, does not know who the Heir of Slytherin is, but he inadvertently provides Harry and Ron with an important clue about the Chamber of Secrets.Unfortunately, the hair that Hermione took from Millicent Bullstrode\'s uniform was from a cat, and as the polyjuice potion is only intended for human transformations she assumes a feline appearance; it takes a little more than a month to restore her normal human form. She is released from the hospital wing in early February, her normal appearance restored.The attacks increase throughout the year, petrifying more students, including Hermione. Most horribly, a message written on a wall declares that Ginny Weasley has been taken into the Chamber, where ""her skeleton will lie forever"".With the help of Ron and Moaning Myrtle (Shirley Henderson), Harry discovers the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets. They force Gilderoy Lockhart, a fraud who wipes clean other wizards\' memories and claims their achievements, to go with them. Once they find the entrance to the Chamber, Lockhart attempts to use Ron\'s broken wand to erase Harry and Ron\'s memories, but the spell backfires on to himself and brings the ceiling caving in, separating Harry from Ron and Lockhart. Lockhart revives, but has now lost his own memory.Harry makes it to the Chamber where he finds an unconscious Ginny. He also meets a young man named Tom Riddle, who claims to be a ""memory"". Harry learns that Ginny, under the control of Lord Voldemort, opened the Chamber. Voldemort, whose real name is Tom Marvolo Riddle (the anagram of which is ""I am Lord Voldemort""), imprinted his memory in an enchanted diary, in order to one day continue the work he began when he reopened the Chamber fifty years ago ridding Hogwarts of non-pureblood witches and wizards. It was Hagrid, a Hogwarts student at the time, who was blamed for the attacks and expelled.Tom Riddle\'s memory grows more powerful as it steals life from Ginny\'s body, and it tries to kill Harry by setting loose a basilisk (the monster responsible for petrifying the students). But Dumbledore\'s (Richard Harris) phoenix, Fawkes, arrives carrying the Sorting Hat, from which Harry draws out the sword of Godric Gryffindor. Fawkes blinds the basilisk, destroying its fatal gaze, and Harry slays it with the sword. In attempting to slay the basilisk Harry\'s arm has been pierced by the creature\'s fang. Harry stabs the diary with one of the basilisk\'s fangs, and the memory of Riddle is destroyed, while Ginny revives from her near-death state. Harry seems to be dying quickly from the venom but Fawkes comes to heal Harry with his tears (phoenix tears have healing power). Ginny and Harry both recover fully, along with those who were petrified: Hermione, Mrs Norris, Justin Finch-Fletchley, Nearly Headless Nick (John Cleese), and Colin Creevey.Harry realizes it was Lucius Malfoy (Jason Isaacs), Draco Malfoy\'s father, who slipped the diary into Ginny\'s cauldron when he encountered the Weasleys in a Diagon Alley bookshop, but he is unable to prove it. Dobby reveals he is the Malfoys\' servant, and knowing their treachery, had been trying to protect Harry all year. In gratitude, Harry sticks one of his old socks into the diary and hands it to Lucius. Lucius throws away the diary, but Dobby catches it and finds the sock hidden in its pages. This constitutes, in Dobby\'s eyes, a gift of clothing the traditional manner in which a master frees a house-elf from servitude. The freed Dobby declares he is eternally grateful to Harry and protects him from an attempted reprisal from Lucius. The word ""Avada"" is used as the beginning of Lucius Malfoy\'s curse, suggesting that it is the Avada Kedavra (the killing curse).Dumbledore dispels Harry\'s fears that he could have been put into Slytherin rather than into Gryffindor when he tells Harry that it is his choices that define him and not his abilities, and that Harry could not have wielded the sword of Gryffindor if he did not truly belong to that house.And end-of-year-feast is held with the revived victims, Hermione reunites with Harry and Ron and Hagrid returns to Hogwarts.']"
56,Wizarding World,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,304141,"[""This is certainly darker than the first two instalments, and not as funny. But based upon a truly excellent but complex book, it is a very good film nonetheless. In my reviews on the first two films, I forgot to mention the music by John Williams. In all three movies, it is very good, but not Williams's best work. His scores to Star Wars, ET and Home Alone are better. The only real quibble i had with the movie was Michael Gambon as Dumbledore. Richard Harris, the first and better Dumbledore, had died, and although Gambon was good, Harris suited the character a lot more in terms of looks and sincerity. The three leads are still likable, and they are given solid support by Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltrane. The real treat lies in the newcomers though, namely David Thewlis as Lupin, Emma Thompson as Trelawney and Gary Oldman as Sirius. Timothy Spall I felt was a little odd for Wormtail. The Dementors I felt quite terrifying, a lot more chilling than they were in the book. All in all, very good. 8/10. Bethany Cox"", ""The third HARRY POTTER film (still gotta get round to reading the books) and definitely a step in a different direction, with more unpredictable narrative – thank god Harry doesn't have to fight a clichéd monster at the end – and better direction by Mexican Alfonso Cuaron, who makes it look darker, gloomier and more magical. It's just as great as the last two (if not better – I think this is my favourite of the three) and despite the over-lengthy running time, the interest doesn't let up. Things I noticed in this film were improved acting all around and plenty more humour than in the last two, but thankfully the humour is actually funny for a change. Hats off to Rupert Grint's Ron, the most hilarious character on screen and a wonderful acting performance. Seeing how the kids have grown up is a little alarming, however! Things are pretty unpredictable, with Harry fighting off the monstrous (and excellent CGI-animated) Dementors, wraith-like ghosts which literally suck your face off. Meanwhile there are all sorts of new and weird things happening, like Pam Ferris turning into a balloon and books that bite your fingers off, pretty much like the Luggage from Pratchett's DISCWORLD series. Added in for good measure are some excellent bonding scenes, tons of humour, a little romance here and there, and some wonderful new creatures animated by computer. The hippogriff and the werewolf, in particular, are fine. The returning actors are fantastic as ever and newcomers Gary Oldman and David Thewlis are very good indeed, although the former a little underused. Thewlis puts in his best turn yet I reckon. Enough action, hijinks, cool effects, and twists (including a little time travel thrown in for good measure) to last any film fan. Here's looking forward to the next one!"", ""This is the third movie in the franchise, and it's the darkest one yet. We're introduced to Dementors, vile creatures who are tasked to guard the prison of Azkaban. When Voldemort disciple Sirius Black escapes, Dementors are assigned to guard Hogwarts putting Harry and his friends in danger.The introduction of Dementors ushers in a new darker chapter in the franchise. These CGI creatures look every bit the evil creatures they're suppose to be. Accomplished director Alfonso Cuarón shows his great skills in creating tension and atmosphere. Even the darken corridors of Hogwarts are more foreboding. Without spoilers, I also must praise Hermione's part of the plot. The story loops created are usually fraught with problems. This one is done with care, and works great. Looking back, the change in tone is what drew me into the Harry Potter franchise. It is the first great Harry Potter movie and in my opinion, the best of the lot."", ""Harry is maturing and becoming more and more involved in that past that has brought him here. Sirius Black becomes the spoken adversary, but his presence is a bit obvious and we moviegoers are a suspicious lot. The three compadres begin to work together in more productive ways, moving the action rather than being moved by it. Hermione begins to become more flesh and blood here and deports herself well. Harry is now dealing with the horror of the potential end of his life and must make his way, discovering clues along the way, knowing that everything isn't always as it seems. Hagred and his hippogriff are pretty cool in this one and the unraveling of the plot with those spooky wraiths guarding Hogwarts is really captivating. There are a few rules that could bear some explanation. I've not read the books and would probably benefit from an occasional explanation. I'm ready for the fourth installment."", 'For the third Harry Potter film, director Chris Columbus was replaced with Mexican Alfonso Cuarón, recently a double Academy Award winner for ""Gravity"". The film scored nominations for its score and visual effects with the Academy, but lost out as all the other Potter movies did. Personally, I would say that Azkaban is better than the second installment and worse than the first, but easily one of the three best movies from the whole series. It is also one of the most successful films at the box office from 2004. It starts again at Potter\'s home as a mean relative comes to visit his aunt and uncle, insults his parents and promptly gets turned into a balloon by Potter. The knight bus (nice wordplay) arrives right in time to save the boy from his raging relatives.The action moves to Hogwarts and we find out that Hermione manages to visit courses simultaneously thanks to some time magic which becomes a crucial part of the film later on. Buckbeak and Hagrid make a nice couple as well, one of the highlights of the film. Malfoy gets into trouble as always and Harry ends up as the big hero again, sometimes a bit too heroic for my taste. Same can be said about the next movie afterward. The film has some humor again as do most of the others. We see Severus Snape in a Grandma\'s dress on one occasion. Looks like the new Defense-against-the-Dark-Arts (played by David Thewlis) teacher is quite a joker. I was not too impressed by the first hour of the film, but things get better quickly afterward. Also the snow at Hogwarts (snowball fight) and paper plane parts are nicely done. Trelawney (Emma Thompson), another teacher at Hogwarts, is really creepy during one scene, almost reminded me of a horror sequence from ""The Exorcist"". One of the sad highlights of the movie is Buckbeak\'s killing although it gets reversed and we don\'t even see it.There were a couple negative points too, however. One would be how Harry all of a sudden uses magic against Snape when he encounters Oldman\'s character, who Harry thought would want to kill him. I found that whole scene pretty cringeworthy and illogical. And as I said earlier, I had some problems with the way Potter is always displayed like some huge powerful superhero. Radcliffe\'s mediocre acting doesn\'t help much. Michael Gambon takes over from hereon as Dumbledore for Richard Harris, who died before this was made. The film\'s biggest strength is possibly the ending. The last hour of the film is among the best the Potter franchise has to offer and all the little details about Harry and Hermione reliving the actual events are done with so much precision that I applaud the makers of this project, for example how he did see himself and not his dad. Only question I asked myself is why would he want to live with Oldman\'s character if he saw his dad who was supposedly alive (again)? But no more spoilers now. Just watch it yourself. You won\'t be disappointed.', 'While travelling for his third year in Hogwarts, the grown-up Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is advised that the criminal Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped the Wizards\' Prison Azkaban. Sirius Black is blamed for being responsible for the death of Harry\'s parents and their best friend, Peter Pettigrew. In the train, Harry Potter faces an evil Dementor, sort of creature who drains good memories and life of their victims and which was sent to chase Sirius Black, but he is saved by Professor Lupin (David Thewlis). Once in Hogwarts, he realizes that the school is surrounded by Dementors, sent to protect Harry Potter and the students against Sirius Black. After many adventures, the truth is disclosed. Although being a good adventure, I found ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" the weakest story of the trilogy. There are many situations used in the other two stories, like the game they play, or the bad treatment of Harry Potter\'s relatives, the character of Emma Thompson is too silly and not funny and Daniel Radcliffe does not correspond in some dramatic situations. Emma Watson, in the role of Hermion Granger, has another excellent performance. It is funny to see how the cast grew and changed in a couple of years. However, this movie is a great entertainment and does not disappoint. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Harry Potter e o Prisioneiro de Azkaban"" (""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban""', ""Its Harry's third year at Hogswarts School of Witchcraft & Wizardry and he returns there in a rush having accidentally used magic at home. Forgiven for this by an understanding Ministry, Harry learns that the murderer Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban and is supposedly coming to finish his killing spree by murdering Harry. With the cruel and ruthless Dementors circling Hogswarts looking for Black, Harry resides in fear until he learns the truth about Black and longs for to find him and extract his own revenge.Meanwhile many other secrets await exposure within the hallowed walls.I was able to see the first two films of the HP series on video at a friend's house for free, which was fortunate because I certainly hadn't been interested enough to pay to see them in the cinema. However, having seen the first two and enjoying them more than I expected, I decided to go and see this one; before I talk about the film let me rant for a minute. First, how very cynical (but unsurprising) that this film has the longest run of adverts (not even trailers) I've ever seen at the cinema \x96 all during them I could hear children bothering parents that they 'want that' \x96 it just confirms that many studios see these sort of films as big seller rather than films. Secondly, this is a dark film with a plot \x96 if you have a group of children who are all younger than 5 then this may not be the film for them; you know that, so why bring them \x96 just say no! Third, if you do bring them then try to control them \x96 chances are they will not be able to sit still for 2+ hours so bring them a colouring book or a soft toy \x96 don't just let them run up and down the stairs. Anyway, as you may have guessed my viewing experience was made more difficult by children who shouldn't have been there but I stayed calm and remembered it wasn't their fault.The film itself is darker and therefore I enjoyed it more \x96 the change of director has made a great difference in that regard. The plot is also more interesting and is based more on characters and tension that the other films. However this is not to say it is great; because it isn't. No, the film has all the flaws of the earlier films and it is far too baggy and long for one thing. I know fans of the book will cry that it should have been 4 hours long to fit everything in and I wouldn't mind any running time if the film can support it; sadly this film cannot even support two and a half hours and it feels like it is dragging at times. The plot is good but it's delivery could have been tightened up a great deal just by minor snips and the further simplifying of the story \x96 it is meant to be entertainment and, if the long running time takes away from the 'fun' it delivers then it has failed and needs to be trimmed further. The effects are better used here and the darker tone is delivered well in many ways; I enjoyed the shadows and the crueller characters even if some of the aforementioned children clearly didn't want to be in the cinema for much of it!The cast suffer from the same problem as they did in the other two films \x96 being too heavy in names who are mainly underused. Radcliffe is better again and seems to be taking the film with him as he matures. Watson has less to do than in the other two films and I didn't think the film served her well; Grint is comic relief and pretty much that's all he does. Oldman needed the work and has said that in interviews but I still thought he did a good job even if his performance is too much one way then the other (as the plot requires him to be). Thewlis is a temporary addition and it is obvious to even those of us who have never read any of the books that he will be a key part of the film \x96 but his performance is mostly good. The rest of the cast is cluttered and mostly not really used very well, although the impact of this is minimised by them being in a series rather than just being underused in one film. Rickman has almost nothing to do, Gambon is a poor man's Dumbledore, Smith barely says a line, Coltrane just does his usual stuff, Emma Thompson is funny and hams it up a fair bit but Spall is poor and it is annoying to think he is a key character. The rest of the cast features well known faces in (deliberately) small roles including Lenny Henry (doing his usual rubbish accent thing), Dawn French, Paul Whitehouse, Mark Williams (who looks like he'll say 'which was nice' at any moment) and special mention to Ingleby who will be loved by all Spaced fans as the thug who doesn't know where 'it's too orangey for crows' comes from in the funniest episode of that great sitcom!Overall this is an OK film but no more than that. I enjoyed it and felt that the darker tone made it a more interesting film even if it chickens out from going very dark in terms of content and feel. The plot is too rambling and the whole film needed to lose another 20 minutes or so to be a tighter more enjoyable film but I can forgive it that, even if I was bored at times. The cast are mostly wasted again and the film is more a product that an actual film but I was still glad I saw it and will watch the next in the series with the ongoing hope that they will improve. Not great but maybe worth watching once and certainly an improvement over the first two in the series."", 'I don\'t know why I pointed him out, but I liked his character here. If you\'ve seen the movie or know the books (I personally haven\'t done the latter), than you know his serious ... excuse me Sirius Black character is very detailed and fun to play (for him) and to watch (for us the viewers).Talking about watching, if you are about to watch this, I can safely assume that have seen or read the previous installments of the franchise, so you know quite a bit about Potter. And you will notice here, that the overall tone just got darker. Which is a good thing! Still family friendly enough though, while Potter remains a ""kid"" magician that has to face another challenge (almost) day by day ...', ""I have to say, I'm quite impressed by the quality of the reviews for this film from fans who follow both the books and the movies in the Harry Potter franchise. To say that they've invested a significant amount of time into their hobby would be an understatement. I don't bring that same intensity to my viewing of the Potter films, for me it's a Saturday evening family entertainment, and the franchise has served well so far. This one had an interesting balance of humor and a more serious dark side, and youngsters might actually wind up with a nightmare or two after watching 'Prisoner of Azkaban'. I remember as a kid being scared of a tree in the middle of a meadow that someone told me would make a grab if you got too close, so I made it a point not to get too close.I also like the whimsical play with words used to describe various components of the story, like the Monster Book of Monsters, and the Accidental Magic Reversal Department. They're introduced into the story with no fanfare, simply as a matter of fact, a part of life for anyone attending the Hogwarts School. Those dementors though, pretty creepy apparitions if I have to say so myself.The first two Harry Potter movies are the only ones I ever saw when they were first released, so I'm behind the curve here as far as most viewers go. That turns out to be a benefit however, as I can watch the series in order at my own pace and not have to wait a long time for the next installment. It's interesting to watch Harry, Hermione, Ron and the rest of the students grow up and into their roles, and consider it a pretty remarkable achievement for J.K. Rowling to have invented this creative ongoing story."", 'Now that Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is in his third year, he has new things with which to contend: Defense against the Dark Arts teacher Remus Lupin (David Thewlis) and escaped prisoner Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), in jail for murdering Harry\'s parents.When I read the book, I realized at the end that there was a clue to one of the things that happens. Maybe it\'s harder for the movie to present that, but they still do a good job with the movie. The cast all does a great job once again. Part 4 was equally good too. It just goes to show how much the Harry Potter franchise is part of our cultural heritage. ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is dynamite.', 'It\'s Harry\'s third year at Hogwarts; not only does he have a new ""Defense Against the Dark Arts"" teacher, but there is also trouble brewing. Convicted murderer Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped the Wizards\' Prison and is coming after Harry. Of the first three Harry Potter films, this is by far my favorite. The atmosphere shifts to a darker place, which may be partly due to the story and partly due to the new director. Besides the darker images, I like the characters introduced here -- Professor Lupin, the best Defense Against the Dark Arts professor thus far, and Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), who is my favorite character in the entire series. We also have the Hippogriff, which is a fantastic creature, and Doby the house elf. And a time travel element that plays out just as effectively -- and with more sense -- than ""Timecrimes"".Harry Potter purists may have some complaints here. Hermione now has normal girl hair rather than the wild, frizzy hair, making her less of an outcast that she may be supposed to be. And they spend very, very little time in their school uniforms. Of course, they are more often outside of the school grounds, so that explains itself. I was curious why Ginny never appears even once. Perhaps she does not appear in the book, but at this point she should be becoming a more important character.There is a line in the film that really stands out: ""Black could be anywhere."" I do not wish to dwell on this, but I cannot help but wonder if this is some sort of inside joke...', ""The previous two films were slightly lighter in tone, and this is when it does become much more than a family film, all the following films go up to the 12 certificate, this is obviously the third instalment, from director Alfonso Cuarón (A Little Princess). Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) runs away from home after losing his patience living with the Dursleys, and he gets picked up by the Knight Bus, taking him to friends Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermoine Granger (Emma Watson). They all hear that supposedly dangerous criminal Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has done the impossible and escaped from Azkaban Prison, and he apparently has links with Lord Voldermort, and there are rumours he wants to kill Harry to avenge the Dark Lord. On the way to Hogwarts the three friends and other passengers on the train are encountered by Dementors, the dark creatures that guard Azkaban, they are looking for Black, but they are not thinking when trying to suck out souls from people. Professor Albus Dumbledore (Sir Michael Gambon, replacing Richard Harris who died shortly after the second film) announces these Dementors around, that Professor Lupin (David Thewlis) is the new Defence of the Dark Arts teacher, he saved Harry's life from a Dementor. Lessons carry on like normal, including tea life reading from Professor Sybil Trelawney (Emma Thompson), and learning to fly Buckbeak the Hippogriff from Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), he is saddened the creature is sentenced to death after attacking Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton). Professor Lupin teaches a class where a creature called a Boggart is used, this creature turns into whatever someone can think of in the moment that scares them the most, and the given spell defeats it with laughter, Harry unfortunately think of a Dementor and is saved again. He also gets attacked by one during Quittitch, so The Professor decides he needs to learn to defend himself against them, and he also gets a Marauder's Map as he can't go without parental permission to Hogsmeade. After Harry gains more of a want to kill Sirius Black overhearing a conversation, where there is mention that he is his godfather, he, Ron and Hermoine visit Hagrid sympathising that Buckbeak will be killed, and then they run after Ron's rat Scabbers, also avoiding being caught by Dumbledore and others. Chasing him they find a secret passageway under the Whomping Willow that leads to the Shrieking Shack, and there they find a dog that is actually Sirius Black transformed, and Lupin, Professor Severus Snape (Alan Rickman), and Peter Pettigrew (Timothy Spall), who was Scabbers, also turn up. During the conversation they find out that Black is innocent, it was in fact Pettigrew that committed the crime, but when Lupin sees the full moon and transforms unintentionally into a werewolf he is allowed to escape. Harry and Black are almost finished off again by Dementors, but before fainting Harry thinks he saw his father James defeat them with the Patronus spell, he wakes and is advised by Dumbledore that he and Hermoine should use time to save a life or two. Hermoine reveals she has a time-turner, which explains why she is never late and appears in her lessons, and they have to save Buckbeak, retracing all their steps so as not to be spotted by their past selves, and not change too much. So Buckbeak is saved, the Executioner did not actually kill him, and they wait for the events in the Shrieking Shack to pass, make Lupin the werewolf come their direction to save their past selves, and it isn't Harry's father that saved him, but Harry himself, and they return to the present fine. In the end Sirius decides that it is best that he stays in hiding as he has not been proved innocent of the crime, and the final scene sees that he sent Harry a new Firebolt broomstick, the fastest in the world.

The young actors grew up very fast and become much more mature, the other actors in the cast do great too, the story is easy to follow, it may be a little odd without Lord Voldermort but it doesn't matter, and of course the scene stealing special effects and action sequences are fantastic, a great fantasy adventure. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Written Music for John Williams and Best Visual Effects, and it won the BAFTA Audience Award and the Children's Award for Best Feature Film, and it was nominated BAFTAs for the Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film, Best Special Visual Effects, Best Make Up/Hair and Best Production Design. Harry Potter was number 45 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, but he was also number 35 on The 100 Worst Britons (the only fictional person, why?). Very good!"", ""I thought this was excellent....better than the first two Harry Potter movies combined and better than what has followed.. That's my feeling, and I'm still sticking to it.This was just great fun, right from the opening. In fact, the early bus scene is the best in the film. Overall, the movie didn't have as mean an edge to it as the others, although it has a number of scary moments (which might have warranted a PG-13 rating). That was fine with me. I got tired of the dark, nasty and/or annoying characters of the first two films, and especially the irritating blonde wise-guy kid. I give this major points for cutting his role down. Even Alan Rickman's character softens.In other words, there is no despicable villain to hate throughout the film, which I thought was refreshing. Instead, we just go through one adventure after another until the final surprise ending.Along the way are a lot of fun special effects and scenery, some humor (Emma Thompson is a hoot as an eccentric tea-leaf reader) and some fantastic 5.1 surround sound. I wish all the Harry Potter films were like this one."", ""Again Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) of J.K.

Harry Potter was a good idea and few people in the history of literature have been able to create such interesting characters and stories. What I mean is, after the first movie there isn\'t much new. We see the continuing story of Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and his friends Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermoine Granger (Emma Watson) at Hogwarts, supported by a cast that includes many of the best British actors. The movies are done in a style that makes it clear they are fantasy, so even when the protagonists are ""in danger"", wink-wink, we know that they aren\'t really in danger. because we know that Harry Potter and his friends will always prevail.SPOILERS follow. In this installment there is a mysterious ""prisoner"" who is out exterminate Harry Potter, already having been responsible for the death of Potter\'s mother and father. Of course this is not true, but is to cover up the real villain, who is one of the professors at Hogwarts. We are introduced to a wonderful animal (I forget the unusual name it was given) which seems to be half horse and half giant bird, which Potter is able to fly on. This comes in handy for an escape later. There is a tree that can move its trunk and branches fast enough to swat people. There is a trinket that enables Harry and Hermoine travel back in time, in a \'Back To The Future\' type of manipulation that allows Harry to save the life of the strange creature. All done in a fine fantasy style. I enjoyed it, for what it is. Light fantasy entertainment, with no lasting aftertaste.I especially enjoyed, in the DVD extras, watching the trailers for the three Harry Potter movies. It is fun to see how the three young actors, the real people, have literally grown up during the trilogy (so far) from young children to young teenagers.', 'After the first two Harry Potter movies, Chris Columbus waived his director\'s seat and after some searing Alfonso Cuaron stepped in. It\'s an interesting choice, as he had only done one \'family-friendly\' film before (A Little Princess), and had just finished an NC-17 film the excellent Y Tu Mama Tambien. Although I\'ve yet to read \'Azkaban\' or any of the books, from what I\'ve heard from those that have it\'s a book that doesn\'t seem to be really progressing too much in terms of a 100% engaging \'plot\'. We\'re only learning so much about Potter\'s lineage, and mostly through the element of Sirius Black, who has escaped from Azkaban prison and has his sights set after Potter to avenge the ""dark lord."" But through this set-up, Cuaron does the most extraordinary things, surpassing Columbus\'s big-epic aspirations and making it...still epic, yes, but with a more ambitious scop in directorial style. Even when things get at their most conventional, there\'s a full sense of balancing whimsy and true dark intonations. I loved how he and the visual effects crew dealt with the Dementors, the shape shifters who act as a double-edged sword with Hogwarts and Potter. I haven\'t seen the film in a while, but I still remember so clearly many scenes and shots, and how the filmmaker this time really brings on a strong presence that actually, if anything, enriches the material of the book.There\'s other small pleasures as well: Emma Thompson wonderfully plays a scatter-shot professor who looks like she could get lost in a grocery store; the beginning scenes, where the pig-headed family that\'s taken in Harry all this time getting their just desserts; the Quiddich battle, which ends up being a little unexpected in some ways, and is actually much ahead in suspense than in even the first film, which introduced the whole bloody concept; the acting by David Thewlis, usually known for more idiosyncratic character roles in movies indie and mainstream, who despite all appearances is also ambiguous. Best of all is Oldman as Sirius Black, and for the brief moments he\'s on screen (and, to be sure, how sentimental the dialog veers towards when he and Potter sit down for a talk on the roof), the screen does the clichéd move of ""lighting up"". Just the poster image alone, with ""have you seen this man"" is ominous, even as there is almost the feeling that he isn\'t quite as evil as might be let on. The levels of darkness in the film are upped a bit- this is the first time that the Harry Potter series has to get a little more mature, even still on ""family-friendly"" terms- and cast and crew are up completely to the challenge.In fact, this might still be my favorite of the Potter films (Order of Phoenix close second), as it does capture the levels of wonder at such a concept that a wizard school offers, and expands further into the crevices of the psychologies of the characters and the possibilities of the identity of evil or good or what might be mixed around. 8.5/10', 'After giving his rude, overweight aunt her just deserts, teenager Daniel Radcliffe (as Harry Potter) is off for another year at ""Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry"" with fellow magic-makers Rupert Grint (as Ron Weasley) and Emma Watson (as Hermione Granger). You can be sure the trio won\'t be bored. First out of the gate is dastardly Gary Oldman (as Sirius Black), who was somehow involved in the murder of Mr. Radcliffe\'s parents. ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" referred to in the title, Mr. Oldman looks out for blood. This puts everyone at ""Hogwarts"" in grave danger...A change in direction, literally, to director Alfonso Cuaron, helps gives this third ""Harry Potter"" film a moodier, darker style; and, it is the perfect accompaniment to the three leading players\' rapidly approaching adulthood. Up until about the time the students unconvincingly mouth animal noises, everything runs smoothly. But, even when it\'s silly, or wanders away from the original text, the story is marvelous. The players are more endearing than ever, even Tom Felton (as Draco Malfoy). And, new ""Defence Against the Dark Arts"" professor David Thewlis (as Remus Lupin) is a howling success.******** Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (5/31/04) Alfonso Cuaron ~ Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, David Thewlis', 'After the two quite children friendly early Potter films the series takes a darker tone from this film onwards and this third year at Hogwarts is certainly one of the better ones.Stripping back a lot of the cosy nature of the first two Potter films the director creates a mean and moody Hogwarts where danger lurks around every corner.The fantastic mostly British acting cast returns with Gary Oldman and Michael Gambon being the two main additions while the young trio of Emma Watson, Rupert Grint and Daniel Radcliffe all give continued great performances as they mature before our very eyes.This film combines all the darkness and heart of the original source material and this film remains one of my personal favourites out of all the Harry Potter films to date.', ""Spoilers herein.This franchise is being managed extremely well, better than any other. The `Lord of the Rings' films were all of a single whole, while these Harry Potter movies are each cognizant of what went before, changing and maturing just as would an adolescent.It has little to do with the story, of course and even less with the insipid monsters and threats. It instead has everything to do with the philosophy of the implied narrator. In the first film, that narrator was without grounding.The second film showed a remarkable (for Hollywood) artistic sensibility in rooting the world of what we see in space. All the important shots were a matter of registration with the buildings around us, mostly the academy. All of a sudden we were aware that someone is actually paying attention to how we see what we see.The jazz in the movie world is now centered on Spanish-speaking fiilmmakers. They alone seem to have a handle on new ways of introspective folding. So the search was on to get the best Hispanic they could. This director was their third choice, but still a good one.In this case, they rooted the narrator in folded time, and here the story helps a bit. The subtle suggestion is that we the viewers are the `dementors,' who hover about and move much like the camera does. (This very same device was also used in `Van Helsing.')Rootless, then space, then time. Wonder where Chris Columbus will take us next?Emily isn't so redheaded this time.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."", ""Well for me at least, having just had my third viewing of this, the third instalment in the Harry Potter franchise, and I'm pleased to report that now I'm finally at peace with how I feel about Alfonso Cuarón's delightful picture. When I first watched this film upon its DVD release, I found myself yearning for the children to be children again, it was as if the magic had gone, for the reason I liked the first two films was because they allowed me to be childlike again, was the franchise losing it's fantastical ability to draw the viewer in and make us feel magically childlike? Thankfully some four years later I'm positively beaming about it's wonderful adult aura, the professionally handled structure, and yes, the delightful magical charm at every turn.The Prisoner Of Azkaban finds Harry aged 13, back at Hogwarts with his friends he finds out that a murderous prisoner has escaped from Azkaban prison, and he's heading straight for Harry.The film suffers from its young stars not quite developing their acting skills to befit the burgeoning onset of their now teenage characters, but it's a minor complaint that's forgiven because the new additions to the adult cast are positively fabulous. One could possibly decry that Gary Oldman & David Thewlis are sadly underused, and to a degree that would be a fair gripe, but both men leave such an indelible impact it helps offset the sad loss of Richard Harris as Dumbledore. Into Dumbledore's big robe comes Michael Gambon, and although he is solid, watchable, and graceful enough, he could never have hoped to achieve the magnificent aura that Harris brought to the role.Directing wise I think it's fair to say that Alfonso Cuarón was blessed with a far better script than Christopher Columbus had for the first two Potter movies, where here we get a gripping denouement and certainly the best finale of the franchise thus far. Certainly this is a darker movie, where threats of death loom large and moody imagery features throughout, but credit has to go to Cuarón for neatly pulling it all together, be it for the snow bound sequences, a Dementor attack, or a sumptuous wide angled shot of the rolling Scottish hills, it's a beautifully crafted piece of work that thrills for adults and kids alike. Stuart Craig's sets are a joy to behold, Michael Seresin's wonderfully mystical cinematography brings the whole locale into your lap, and John Williams naturally scores it with deftness personified. In short it's the technical highlight of the franchise so far and a benchmark that the others will struggle to equal. 9/10RIP Richard Harris."", 'Pretty decent movie but I think the book is better', ""The best thing that ever happened to the Harry Potter saga is the selection of Alfonso Cuaron to direct the film and bring the third installment to the screen. Mr. Cuaron is a huge talent, and his contribution to this movie is enormous.Credit must go to Mr. Cuaron in perhaps getting Daniel Radcliffe to be a bit less stiff than in the other two films before. Also, Mr. Cuaron has the advantage of bringing together most of the best actors of the English stage and cinema.David Thewlis excels as Professor Lupin. This excellent actor has never been better and it's a shame we don't get to see him much. What can one say of the tremendously gifted Alan Rickman? His contribution is also vital to the film. Gary Oldman as Sirius Black is amazing. So is Timothy Spall, in the small role of Peter Pettigrew.On the other hand, the female roles are a bit anemic. One would have liked to have seen more of the incomparable Julie Christie, who is seen through a glass darkly! Emma Thompson is hilarious as Professor Sybil Trelawney.Let's hope that now that Mr. Cuaron has been found, the producers entrust him with the next films."", ""What strikes me most about this third Potter film is how truly dark it is during its two hours and twenty minutes of storytelling. Darker both in theme and in cinematography. Although the photography is striking at times, too much of the film is enveloped in darkness which is going to make a lot of the special effects look a lot less intriguing when it makes its transition to home video.This entry is first-rate entertainment all the way. Daniel Radcliffe looks considerably more mature than he did previously but his acting remains largely one-dimensional until he is moved to anger. The early sequence where he puts a hex on a boorish aunt by inflating her like a balloon is the most whimsical touch of magic in the whole film. All the other magic is mostly on the dark side and this is precisely what's wrong with this Potter entry--not enough bits of humor to lighten up when things get too tense. Apparently, kids will love it anyway.Standouts in the cast are Alan Rickman's hateful Snape and Emma Thompson's brief turn as an off the wall professor. Largely ignored is Maggie Smith who barely matters at all--another case where her zaniness would have injected more humor into the dark plot. She no sooner delivers a few lines than she is gone for the rest of the film.Most outstanding special effect is the half-eagle half-horse creation (the Hippogriff) which does an amazing job of looking both real and frightening as it takes Harry for a wild ride in the sky.Emma Watson's Hermione could have used some dubbing to clarify her spoken words for American audiences and Rupert Grint continues to be the most amusing of the leading trio with his expressions of fright or disbelief. Both have settled easily into their roles. Robbie Coltrane has some nice moments here.Imaginative and abetted by a nice background score--but a bigger dose of humor would have balanced all of the darker aspects of the tale. Noticeably missing is the sort of quirky humor that pervaded the first Potter film directed by Chris Columbus."", ""I was not crazy about the first film, and while the second film was better it still wasn't the be all and end all. This film is damn near close to being the be all and end all.Granted the acting is at times off by the two male leads,and Malfoy is too much of a wimp but for the most part this is everything that the first two films should have been but weren't. I have to credit the fact that this film was not directed by Chris Columbus, who is too light weight a director and was too faithful to the material. That is not the case here...Here the hero is director Alfonso Cuarón, who made great dark fantasy by handling the material the way that it should have been handled. He made changes in the source, but kept everything focused on characters and plot. Best of all he made a movie that seems real, no matter how fantastic it gets, something that never happened in the first two films.I want to recommend this film to everyone, but I'm pretty certain you'll be best off if you watch one of the first two films to bring you up speed. It's worth it, trust me."", ""I have seen a lot of movies over the years with Julie Christie. My favorite is Heaven Can Wait. But, her role in this movie is the very antithesis of the lovely Julie, that it is appropriate on her birthday.She played Madame Rosmerta, a minor role in a great film with the usual cast of Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson. Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Alan Rickman, and Gary Oldman as Sirius Black. Yes, I watch harry Potter movies. I have even read all the books three times each and anxiously await the next book and movie. Life is too interesting to get stuck in just a few types; whether it be books, music, movies, or women.This was director Alfonso Cuarón's (Y tu mamá también ) greatest film. He was actually supposed to do Children of Men when he was offered this one."", 'It opens at the Dursleys\' home where Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) lives and is staying, as usual, during the summer holidays. Uncle Vernon\'s (Richard Griffiths) sister Marge (Pam Ferris) comes to visit and treats Harry with general contempt. She viciously insults him and his parents, angering Harry who unwittingly uses his innate magical powers to cause her to inflate, and float off, out of the Dursleys\' house and into the twilight. Harry flees the Dursleys\' home, furious. At first he walks with determination but soon grinds to a stop as he realizes he hasn\'t anywhere to go. He sits down at the edge of the road with his trunk. His surroundings stir as the wind picks up and a street lamp flickers above him. A jet black dog emerges from the bushes opposite, growling at him and he raises his wand. At that instant however, the eccentric Knight Bus, for lost witches or wizards, makes a sharp appearance and escorts Harry on a wacky journey to the wizards\' pub \'The Leaky Cauldron.\' While there, Harry learns that Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), an alleged supporter of Lord Voldemort, the dark wizard, has escaped from Azkaban prison. Harry must meet the Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge (Robert Hardy) and he fears expulsion from Hogwarts for his using of under-age magic out of school. However, the matter is surprisingly dropped as ""...the Ministry doesn\'t send students to Azkaban for blowing up their aunts."" While at The Leaky Cauldron Harry also reconvenes with his two best friends, Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), and the rest of the Weasley family. Mr. Arthur Weasley (Mark Williams) pulls Harry to one side to warn him about Sirius Black. He suggests that Harry needs to be cautious of Sirius Black due to his allegiance with Voldemort. He believes that Harry is the only thing which stands in the way of Voldemort returning to power and that it is on this premise that Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban. To find and kill Harry Potter.Harry, Ron and Hermione board the train to Hogwarts, discovering in their compartment the sleeping Professor Remus Lupin (David Thewlis) who is to be the new \'Defence Against the Dark Arts\' teacher. Harry airs his concerns about Black\'s escape and his possible objective to Ron and Hermione. Tension builds during their discussion however as the train is stopped on a bridge and the lights pop out in each cabin. Ron peers out of the window, concerned that ""...there is something out there."" The train is violently jolted and a great cold descends around them, ice creeping over the windows. In the corridor outside, a scary dark creature slowly appears, floating towards them. It opens the door to their cabin and begins to engage frighteningly with Harry, sucking at his whole body. The sleeping teacher suddenly wakes, stands up, and repels the creature with a very bright white light emanating from his wand. Harry faints. On his coming round Lupin gives him chocolate to eat and explains that the creature is a \'Dementor\' which drains happiness from anything it approaches. The Dementors ordinarily guard the wizard prison, \'The Prison of Azkaban\' but are out searching for the escapee Black, and entered the train looking for him. Harry heard a woman screaming during the ordeal, but no one else heard it.As Harry begins his third year at Hogwarts we learn of some significant changes. Alongside the official announcement of the formerly encountered, new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Professor Lupin. Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), the groundsman, becomes additionally a professor of \'Care of Magical Creatures.\' Also, Hermione seems to be taking nearly twice as many classes as everyone else, including some which are taught simultaneously.During a Divination class, Professor Trelawney (Emma Thompson) foresees Harry\'s death in the tealeaves of his cup, which form the shape of a \'Grim\' or large dog. In tealeaf reading this symbolises death. In Hagrid\'s first class, Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) deliberately provokes Buckbeak, a Hippogriff, into attacking and injuring him. Draco\'s father, Lucius Malfoy, a powerful Ministry of Magic member of staff, files an official complaint. In Defence Against the Dark Arts, Professor Lupin instructs the class in the defeat of a Boggart, which changes its form to appear as one\'s greatest fear. When Harry steps up, it manifests itself as a Dementor, however Lupin steps in to defeat it before Harry gets the chance.Harry is told he can\'t go on the school outings to Hogsmeade, a local village inhabited solely by magical beings, as he hasn\'t got his admission slip signed, and watches his friends go without him. Instead, he meets with Lupin, and Harry discovers that the reason he wasn\'t allowed to fight the Boggart was that Lupin had been worried it would take the shape of Voldemort. This concern catches Harry by surprise, because Harry had been thinking even more fearfully about the Dementors. Later that night, Sirius Black breaks into Hogwarts and destroys the Fat Lady\'s (Dawn French) portrait that guards Gryffindor Tower. The students spend the night sleeping in the Great Hall while the teachers search the castle for Black. Because Black is believed at large in the castle Dementors are sent specifically to patrol the perimeter of Hogwarts. Next day, Professor Snape (Alan Rickman) replaces Lupin as Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher while Lupin is intriguingly ""...incapable of teaching at the present time."" In an odd divergence from routine, he teaches the class about Werewolves.During the next school Quidditch match, a popular wizard sport, several Dementors approach and try to engage their powers over Harry, causing him to faint and fall off his broomstick. Dumbledore (Michael Gabon) breaks Harry\'s fall, but his broomstick flies off into the magical tree, the \'Whomping Willow\' and is destroyed. Dumbledore is angry that the Dementors came within school grounds as they are prohibited from doing so. Harry wonders why the Dementors seem to have a special interest in him and Lupin reveals that this is due to the horrors within Harry\'s past. Harry considers that he needs to know how to defend himself against them and convinces Lupin as such, who agrees to teach him.At the time of the next school outing, still keen to go to Hogsmeade, Harry attempts to sneak into the village under his Invisibility Cloak, but is caught by Fred and George Weasley (James and Oliver Phelps), who give him the Marauder\'s Map. It is a map of the entire school and shows the real-time locations of everyone on the grounds. Fred and George also tell Harry that the map shows the whereabouts of several secret passages out of Hogwarts, ideal for leaving undetected. Once in Hogsmeade village, and back under his Invisibility Cloak, Harry catches sight of the Minister Fudge and Professor Minerva McGonagall (Maggie Smith) chatting in the street, discussing Black and himself. He follows them as they go inside and is shocked to overhear that Sirius Black was his parents\' best friend and is still his godfather and a legal guardian. Black supposedly divulged the Potter\'s secret whereabouts to Lord Voldemort and murdered their friend Peter Pettigrew, as well as twelve Muggle bystanders (non-magic humans). Harry vows to kill Black. On returning from the outing we find out from Hagrid that as a consequence of Lucuis Malfoy\'s complaint, Buckbeak has been sentenced to death. That same night, after hours, Harry is astonished when he sees the aforementioned Peter Pettigrew\'s name on the Marauder\'s Map. He goes looking for him but can\'t find him. After Professor Snape discovers Harry out of bed, the map is confiscated by Lupin who meets them, and, covering for Harry, tells Snape it is merely a joke parchment and of no significance.Harry has the agreed private class with Lupin, in which he must generate a Patronus, a shield that is used to repel the Dementors. Lupin has him test himself out on a Boggart. He fails the first time, but conjures one on his second attempt. Later on, returning to a recently finished Divinations class to bring back a crystal ball knocked over by Hermione, Harry reencounters Professor Trelawney. She grabs Harry by the shoulder, speaks as though possessed, and predicts that ""...the Dark Lord\'s servant will return to him that night and that innocent blood shall be spilled.""When Harry, Ron and Hermione learn that Buckbeak is to be executed, they visit Hagrid in his hut to console him. On the way Draco taunts them about it and Hermione punches him in the face. While there, Hagrid says they cannot remain with him during the execution and that Buckbeak can\'t be set free, since the officials would know it was Hagrid. Hagrid has also found Ron\'s lost rat Scabbers, and returns him to Ron. Ron had wrongly believed that his rat had been eaten by Hermione\'s cat. As the execution party approaches the hut, stones fly in through the window and they leave and run back to the edge of the castle, watching the execution from afar. Scabbers then bites Ron, who chases after him, finally collecting him under the Whomping Willow. The black dog makes another appearance and attacks Ron and drags him, along with Scabbers, into a hole at the tree\'s base. Harry and Hermione follow, finding a tunnel which leads them to the Shrieking Shack.Inside, in a fast moving scene, Harry finally confronts Sirius Black who he has been led to believe wishes to kill him, and whom he wishes to kill. We discover that as an illegal Animagus, Black can transform into animal at will, thus he is also the infamous black dog. Professor Lupin, who had spotted the group on the confiscated Marauder\'s Map, suddenly bursts in and embraces his old friend Black. Confronted by Hermione, Lupin admits to being a werewolf. Lupin and Black then explain that Black is not the one who betrayed the Potters, rather it was Peter Pettigrew (Timothy Spall), who has been hiding for twelve years in his Animagus form as Scabbers, Ron\'s rat. He is Voldemort\'s servant, not Black, and he framed Black for his crimes. Meanwhile Snape bursts in also confronting Black but is disposed of by Harry. Harry is skeptical of the story until Black and Lupin force Pettigrew back into his human form, and after some squealing resistance Pettigrew finally confesses that it is true, proving Black\'s innocence. Black further clears up the misunderstanding by explaining, that on discovering Pettigrew was still alive, he escaped Azkaban in order to kill him. As Lupin and Black are about to kill Pettigrew, Harry stops them, and showing Pettigrew mercy, tells him they will take him back to the castle, where he can be left for the Dementors.As the group heads back to the castle, Harry and Sirius pause and chat optimistically. Harry remarks that Pettigrew would have been of no use dead. Firstly he didn\'t want his father\'s two best friends to be killers, and secondly he is the key in proving Sirius\'s innocence. Sirius suggests Harry comes to live with him. They are disturbed however, when, as the full moon rises, it causes Lupin to turn into the dangerous werewolf since he had neglected to take his potion which inhibits this transformation. Black responds by transforming again into the black dog in order to protect Harry, Ron and Hermione. The werewolf and Black have a vicious fight. During the ensuing commotion, Pettigrew transforms himself back into the rat and escapes, not pursued. Harry runs forward in his angst at Sirius\'s torture at the hands of the werewolf, inadvertently attracting its attention. However while approaching Harry, it is distracted by some other distant werewolf cry. Meanwhile, Sirius, badly injured, has moved down to the nearby lake where he lies at the edge. Harry follows and kneels over him. As he does so, a swarm of Dementors approaches them. Harry produces a Patronus to try and fend them off, however it is not nearly strong enough and they both begin to submit to the Dementors. Then on the other side of the river appears the brilliant white symbol of a stag and an immense Patronus which drives the Dementors away. Harry faints.Harry awakens in the hospital wing to hear the news, that Sirius Black has been captured and is about to be given the Dementor\'s Kiss, to suck out his soul. Dumbledore enters and Harry, Ron and Hermione try and convince him of Black\'s innocence. Dumbledore somehow already knows, but says that their word alone won\'t be believed. However, he suggests mysteriously, that Harry and Hermione travel in time back by using Hermione\'s time-turning device (we now find out how she has been attending simultaneous classes), and at least save both Black and Buckbeak from their fates. Hermione turns her hour-glass necklace back three turns (three hours), and Harry and Hermione are together thrust into the past, where they observe and remould the evenings events. They throw stones through the window of Hagrid\'s hut, alerting themselves of the approaching execution party. They rescue Buckbeak while the execution party is inside with Hagrid shortly before the execution, thus absolving Hagrid of any blame. Hermione diverts the attention of the werewolf Lupin stalking the past Harry with an imitation of another werewolf\'s cry. And, from a hiding place in the forest, Harry watches the Dementor sequence and realizes, as the stag symbol fails to appear, that he must have been the one who conjured the powerful Patronus. After saving his past self and Black from the Dementors, Harry and Hermione fly on Buckbeak\'s back to the tower, where Black is imprisoned, and rescue him. Harry and Black share a moment of contemplation, as since Black is going to be back on the run, still wanted and without proof of his innocence, their relationship will now be sadly fraught with complications and Harry\'s dream of living with his godfather is shattered. However, Harry takes comfort in knowing that Black, although still considered a fugitive, is at least free and safe for the time being. Black and Buckbeak leave, Black riding on his back. Harry and Hermione make it back to the hospital wing just as the timeline restores itself, and a reticent Dumbledore merrily bids them goodnight.As the school year end approaches, Lupin announces that he is resigning, believing that parents of the students would not be comfortable in the now open knowledge that he is a werewolf. He returns the Marauder\'s Map to Harry since he is no longer a professor. Harry later receives a gift from an unknown source, a Firebolt, an extremely fast racing broom. Hermione holds up a large feather, also contained within the parcel, confirming that Sirius must have sent it. Harry tries it out and is whisked away from sight, ending the film with the snapshot image of Harry flying his new broom, ecstatic.']"
57,Wizarding World,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,330373,"[""It's unfortunate that so much of the book needed to be cut for time and the movie is still nearly 2 1/2 hours long. The rule of movie editing is when you must trim for time you remove the sub-plots. A lot of story and character development isn't there.But what is there is a great visual treat. If the movie leaves you with questions just read the book or get the audio version on CD. It would have taken a minimum of another half hour to flesh the movie out and that simply wasn't going to be done by a studio whose primary target is a younger audience. (Note how no studio wants to release an animated film longer than 90 minutes for this reason.) Perhaps Alphonso Curon would have done a better job of cohesion but there really isn't much more that could have been done in the time and the script would have been essentially the same. This movie begs for an extended Lord of the Rings type DVD, another 30 to 60 minutes to give you what was left out for theatrical release.See it and spend the bucks to see it on the big screen."", ""First, the good news -- The special effects and the music in the this movie were the best yet! The underwater scenes especially were very well done. The thing I disliked most about the movie is that Albus Dumbledore is not portrayed as the calm, wise old wizard he is in the books. Instead he is portrayed as a stormy, confused old man that doesn't have much of a clue what's going on. The character of Dumbledore is just WAY off. In one scene Dumbledore grabs Harry around the neck and shakes him, what's THAT about? The very thought of Albus Dumbledore being physically violent with a student is Absolutely ABSURD!! THATS NOT IN DUMBLEDORE'S CHARACTER!! Real Harry Potter fans all over are going to be outraged by this portrayal of Dumbledore. That pretty much ruined the movie for me. Another thing I didn't like about this movie was that so much of the real story was left out and/or changed. I guess i'm just spoiled because I'm so attached to the books... I know it's impossible to fit that whole story in a 2 1/2 hour movie, but there was some pretty good stuff that was left out.If you're interested, Some of the things that weren't included in the movie that stuck out in my mind are:The scene where Dudley eats the ton-tongue coffee and has an enlarged tongue. The Dursley's aren't included in this one at all.Weasley's Wizard Weezes are not mentionedThe character Ludo Bagman is left out altogetherWinky isn't in the movieS.P.E.W (Society for the Protection of Elfish Welfare), the Elf-rights activist group formed by Hermione, is left out altogether. And i thought this added a lot to the story throughout the bookHagrid's humiliation at being exposed as a Half-giant is left out, and so of course is Harry, Ron, and Hermione coming to comfort himno Blast-Ended ScrewtsHermione never catches Rita Skeeter in her animagus form (a beetle) as she does in the bookThe scene in which Draco Malfoy is attacked on the train near the end isn't in the movieThe money Harry wins from the tournament and gives to Fred and George to go toward starting their joke shop is left outThe discussion with Fudge about Voldemort's return and his refusal to accept it is left out. I don't know how they're going to reconcile this one because Fudge's refusal to accept Voldemort is crucial in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.Sirius coming to Hogwarts to see Harry after the Third Task is left outI'm still ticked off about Dumbledore... I'm starting to think that the people who make the movies just don't even read the books, because Dumbledore was SO out of character it made me angry. That bothers me more than anything else. I wouldn't rush to see this movie, wait until it comes out on DVD. Besides the good special effects and music, the movie was really bad. I Hope this review has been helpful."", ""The movie ran as if it were a series of highlight clips from an actual film representation of the fourth harry potter novel. Details were thrown in haphazardly, if for no other reason than to bring a feeling of recognition from readers. If the viewer had not read the book, but only seen the previous two movies, s/he would not have understood the movie. The screenwriters created no semblance complicated plot, but rather the rather single-minded story of the three tasks in the tri-wizard tournament. All new characters were hardly introduced and remained quite one-dimensional, which is unfortunate; even old favorites got the shaft in this one. There was no time for more than two short scenes with either Malfoy, no magical lessons, and Dobby the house elf was completely absent. Crouch never disappeared, but his body was found dead. The cinematics in this case were atrocious: Harry appears in Dumbledore's chambers in the scene immediately after discovering Crouch's body, but then proceeds to tell him about his scar hurting and dreams rather than Crouch's discovery. There was no magical map, no late-night encounters with Moody, no discussion of Snape and Karkaroff's relationship, nor of Dumbledore trusting Snape. Seeing as this relationship will rise to be the single most prominent issue in the entire series, I was very disappointed to find it was ignored in favor of large and ineffective theatrics, such as a hedge maze without any traps, only shifting walls and evil roots, an extremely obnoxious modernized yule ball, and a pointlessly drawn out dragon chase scene. Dumbledore's lines and the directing of his acting made him look like an old, bumbling fool, rather than the clever, most-powerful-wizard on the planet, the only person of whom Voldemort is afraid. The writers decided to add Crouch Jr. into Harry's dreams, completely removed the second house-elf and the invisibility cloak from the quidditch world cup, and had the audacity to explain that Crouch Jr. had been sent to Azkaban, but never explained his escape. Finally, the movie ended with Crouch Jr. being sent back to Azkaban. The Minister of Magic never showed up with dementors to kill Crouch, Dumbledore never argued with him about the verity of Harry's claims, and the potential for an amazing cliff-hanger conclusion with Dumbledore in all his might giving orders to Hagrid and others as a general before the final battle, was instead replaced by a horrible attempt at a eulogy combining direct quotations from the novel with poor scriptwriting to make Dumbledore out to be a poor speaker as well as incompetent wizard. I shudder to think how the next movie will have to deal with all of these plot gaps, and how Dumbledore can hope to maintain any semblance of respectability when he trusts Snape and continues to avoid Harry in the fifth movie. Much better would have been to stick with the original idea and make two movies. This movie didn't feel like it had any plot, one did not become attached to the characters, and spent the movie groaning or laughing at the contrived immaturity of it all. Some acting by Harry and friends was good, but it was overshadowed by a terrible attempt to fit everything and nothing into the movie."", ""Based on one of the best books of the Harry Potter series, the film adaptation of 'Harry Potter and the Goblet' had a lot to live up to and I think it succeeded. As Potter fans will know, in GoF, Harry is now fourteen and in his Fourth Year at Hogwarts. When an ancient tournament between Hogwarts and two other European wizarding schools is held that year, a Seventh Year contestant is chosen from each school to compete but things go dramatically awry when Harry, three years too young to even be entered in the dangerous and challenging tournament, is somehow also chosen after his name is mysteriously nominated. GoF is a sharp turning point in the books as the tone darkens considerably and the characters themselves change from being rather wide-eyed innocent children to adolescents thrust the turbulent, uncertain adult world where being 'good' or even an innocent will not guarantee your survival. This shift is also reflected in the film, which was rated 12A (PG13 for Americans), the first of the HP films to be rated so high.I have to say I did enjoy this film, although Prisoner of Azkaban remains my favourite of the four. Unlike the first two films, this did not attempt to condescend as much to small children in the audience. The tasks of the Triwizard tournament captured most of the thrills of the book, particularly the second water-based task where the merpeople were suitably creepy (now we know why none of the kids go swimming in the summer term!), but the first task over-ran for a minute or two more than needed. Light romance was touched upon yet wasn't over-emphasised and the Yule Ball will please those who enjoyed the scenes in the book but audience members over the age of sixteen might find teens ogling each other a tad dull (Hermione is very out-of-character and the scene does drag).The acting of the adult cast is, of course, exemplary as always. Alan Rickman's Snape may only have had four or so scenes but he definitely made his presences known while Maggie Smith really captured the essence of McGonagall. Many people do miss Richard Harris' Dumbledore but I found that Michael Gambon has done an excellent job of moulding the role to make it his own. In GoF, Dumbledore feels very human in the way he carries the weight of the wizarding world on his shoulders and though he struggles at times, his concern for his pupils is paramount. I finally felt the close rapport between Dumbledore and Harry in this film that was missing in the previous three HP flicks. However, the prize has to go to Brendan Gleeson for his scene-stealing depiction of Mad-Eye Moody. Gleeson clearly enjoyed illustrating Moody's dangerous, feral edge.The younger cast have also grown into their roles, improving from their previous outing. Rupert Grint, usually used to playing a comical and stupid Ron, had the chance to cut his acting teeth and show Ron's darker, bitter side and he did well. The Phelp twins have also improved dramatically. No longer do they come across as wooden cut-outs just reading from a cue-card and instead they are able to show the mischievous spontaneity of the Weasley twins. And I look forward to seeing more of Matthew Lewis, who was great at showing Neville's sensitive side without making him too klutzy. Out of the younger cast, though, Dan Radcliffe is the one who has progressed the most. In PoA, he was awful in the 'he was their friend' scene so he seems like another boy in the harrowing graveyard scene and the aftermath, depicting Harry's anger, feelings of vulnerability and grief. He still stumbled on occasion in other scenes but I, at last, have faith he might be able to do the Harry of 'Order of the Phoenix' justice when the time comes.The film did lose points on a few issues. Although most of the young cast have expanded their acting skills as they have gone on, Emma Watson is waning. She has a tendency of over-enunciating her lines and being too melodramatic, which worked in 'The Philosopher's Stone' when Hermione was condescending and childishly bossy, but is just annoying by this point. She spent most of the film sounding as if she was on the verge of tears or in a hormonal snit, even in scenes which were not remotely sad or upsetting. There was also a choppy feel to the film, as if Steve Kloves struggled to properly condense the book into a two-hour film. Those who haven't read the books will have missed quite a bit and those who have read the books will feel the film is very rushed. Molly Weasley and the Dursleys were also missed, especially since I think Julie Walters would have been exceptional in the Molly/Harry interactions that take place aftermath of the graveyard scenes of the novel as the film didn't round off in a manner that reflected a boy had died and Harry would be traumatised by what he saw.I think most Potter fans will enjoy this although they will remark that it could have been better. Non-fans will also get something from this film as I imagine it is hard not to be captivated by the many action and dramatic events but they may find themselves muddled by the story. I would recommend that parents of young children either keep away or, at the very least, check out the film firstly before deciding if their child is old enough to cope with it. When I went to see it, there was a small lad of four or five being dragged along and in the middle of a particularly fearsome incident, the silence of the moment was cut by a wee voice crying, 'Mummy, I'm scared' so, parents, be warned."", ""Before I review the film, let me start off by saying that I am a fan of the Harry Potter films and have liked all of them up to this point. I'm not going to compare the movie to the book because, as most people know, they are two completely different animals. There is no way in heaven, hell or on God's green Earth that a book the size of Goblet of Fire could appropriate EVERYTHING that happened in the novel. I'm going to go by what I saw up on the screen.What I saw up on the screen was a completely pedestrian effort that made no attempt at contributing style, substance, or character development to a series that was getting better and better with each progressive film. Scenes start and stop with no explanation. The big action scenes (especially the fight with the dragon) just begin with no buildup whatsoever almost as if you've stumbled upon someone playing the new Harry Potter video game. There is no sense of the passage of time at all. The Tri-Wizard tournament consists of only three challenges yet the competition seems to last the entire school year. Ron and Hermione have a blow-up at the Yule Ball because of his misplaced jealousy yet six months go by (the last day of school) and NOTHING MORE is ever said about it? She even tells him that he made a mistake by not asking her out and he lets SIX MORE MONTHS go by without saying a word?!I can forgive the fact that a lot of these things are just glossed over because of the time crunch but I can not forgive situation after situation that has something happen only because the lead character needs to live. In the aforementioned fight with the dragon, Harry ends up hanging from a ledge 100 stories above the ground trying to reach his broom which is nearby. The dragon lands on the building and begins crawling down to him, slipping and sliding, peeling away shingles as it goes and it suddenly hit me. Harry is hanging from a ledge, defenseless, and the dragon is CRAWLING toward him. He is dealing with a creature who spits fire and who can FLY. One flap of its wings and a quick belch and Harry is crispy. The ONLY reason it doesn't is because Harry has to live. And for that matter, no one in the film acts or reacts to a situation because it's in their nature to do so. They react in a certain way because that's what the script demands that they do, even if it completely goes against their character and everything that we know about them. When Hermione blows up at Ron, it seems to come out of nowhere. She seems to be mad because Ron didn't ask her and she wanted to go with him. But if this is true, why is she so happy about being there with a competitor from a rival school? And I don't just mean happy, I mean she is absolutely BEAMING when she arrives with him. And at one point, Dumbledore grabs Harry and shakes him violently demanding that he answer a question. My reaction to that was WTF??? Has Dumbledore ever shown that he's a violent person or that he would grab a STUDENT, yelling in his face? Of course not but he does it because the script says he has to. At one point in the film, a particular curse is brought up that allows you to control another being. That's kind of funny because it seems like every character in this film is being controlled by the screenplay, even if it means going completely against character.But I guess the biggest disappointment for me was the confrontation between Harry and Voldemort. For someone who has been built up to be the devil, he sure is beaten easily at the end of this film (and by a quartet of ghosts, no less, which took cheesiness to a new level). The appearance of Voldemort is obviously supposed to be chilling but, in actuality, he looks like a hairless rat wearing a cape. The great Ralph Fiennes does everything he can but part of the appeal of this character is NOT seeing him in closeup in full daylight. He shows up when he wants and manages to let Harry live because he'd rather talk him to death instead of just cutting off his head while Harry is pinned down. But, of course, that's because Harry has to live and this final confrontation, again, seems ridiculous in retrospect.The entire Tri-Wizard tournament seemed a little off-kilter to me. You perform tasks that test your abilities and try to do better than your opponents, but to what end? The final test consists of entering an ever-changing maze and the first competitor to find the trophy wins the tournament. So, even if you finish DEAD LAST in every other challenge, if you're the first to find the trophy, you win anyway. So, I ask you, WHAT'S THE FRIGGIN' POINT OF EVEN COMPETING IN THE OTHER CHALLENGES?????? Why put yourself in harm's way three times when you only HAVE to do it once? Looking back, I just realized that you could completely skip this film and move right on to number five without missing a beat as long as you had someone to tell you two things about the film - Harry's interest in Cho and Voldemort being back, sort of. Here's hoping Order of the Phoenix doesn't follow the same path."", ""Mike Newell is forgiven for cutting out so much detail from the book, and JK Rowling is forgiven for writing wonderfully rich books. However, fans of the book cannot help but feel like riding a roller coaster that is so fast there is no time to enjoy the ride. I predict the huge void between book and movie will spur remakes in about 10 to 20 years. Even if the movies must be 5 hours long, Harry Potter fans are willing to sit through them. This movie doesn't get a 10 because it leaves me feeling like something is missing, but it does deserve a 9 for being the best possible portrayal of the book given a 2.5 hour limitation. All said and done, this is the shortest 2.5 hour movie I have ever watched."", ""As a fan of the potter book series, I'm going to start with my opinion of the movie,and then I'm going to slaughter the adaption.as a movie this was ALMOST amazing. the special effects (other than the captives under the water) were generally of an excellent standard. The acting of the trio was well above what it has been previously. Especially in the case of Emma Watson, who was initially terrible but has improved with each movie. Bravo i say! Rupert Grint is always a joy to watch. he really is Ron Wealsey for me, despite that fact that hes the same height as Radcliffe. speaking of Radcliffe, i was exceptionally impressed! he was brilliant for the most part, but especially during the scenes with Voldemort in the grave yard and when he returned to Hogwarts. However, credit given to those, i have to say that Alan Rickman as Snape is the best! This isn't just because he is my favourite character but i genuinely thought that he was brilliant, particularly during the scene when Harry and Ron keep talking. dumbledore on the other hand was atrocious. I'm afraid this is where my commentary moves onto slaughtering the adaption.Since when exactly, has Dumbledore ever lost control and shaken Harry. If this is how he reacts to harry's name being entered, what the hell is he going to do when Harry destroys his office in The Order of the Pheonix. Michael Gambon may be a fine actor but he just isn't Dumbledore.and is it me or did the film lack certain key elements that made the book? such as the fact that Harry has a parent figure now? when the Thing with Sirius happens in OOTP, the audience wont know anything about him. And the scene with the Dursleys at the beginning was one of the best in the book! I understand that for the obvious reasons such as time management, certain elements have to be omitted, but this really did take the biscuit. Why alter scenes which arnt vital to the book, such as the way that the first task played out, and then cut what makes the books great. The two things that really wound me up were the way that Sirius appeared in the fire (why the hell they did it like that ill never understand) and the change in who gave Harry the Gillyweed. Those changed really were pointless.When viewed as a movie in its own right the Goblet of Fire is as enjoyable, thrilling and down right scary as the book is, but as an adaption, to be quite honest, it was a let down."", ""I have to say, I'm really disappointed in how this film turned out, especially in comparison with how great the book is. In my humble opinion, studios have to face up to the fact that two and a half hours is no longer sufficient to capture the scope and power of J.K. Rowling's universe.In this film, Harry is forced to enter the Triwizard Tournament when someone unknown puts his name into the Goblet of Fire, a magical artifact that serves as the selector of competitors from each participating school. The special effects, as always, are spectacular, but they seem to be a cover for a lack of effort, not the results of a work of love.All of the highlights of the book are shown; the Quidditch World Cup, Harry's battle with the dragon, the underwater world of the merpeople and the enchanted hedge maze are all done in exquisite detail. But this only seems to point up the movie's shortfalls. Michael Gambon has none of Richard Harris' quiet dignity or unflappable demeanor as Dumbledore; instead he seems to jump at every shadow and constantly be lost in the situation. The worst example of this is when he almost tackles Harry and desperately interrogates him on whether he put his name in the Goblet of Fire.The movie skips from one event to the next with very little shown of the intervening time; action is held up as a replacement for character development and plot. Draco Malfoy, the cruel bully everyone loves to hate, is only shown twice through the whole film. Mad-Eye Moody, beautifully portrayed by Brendan Gleeson, is given little to do other than push Harry along. Nothing is explained of the backstory between Barty Crouch and his son, nor of Snape's past or what Dumbledore intends to do in the face of Voldemort's return.Along that line, Ralph Fiennes' portrayal of Lord Voldemort suffers in much the same way Michael Gambon's portrayal of Dumbledore does. Instead of the patient, cunning Dark Lord I'd come to expect from the first two movies, he is easily angered and has no control of his emotions or reactions, much less the situation. The scene should look hopeless, but it is obvious right from the start that Harry is more than Voldemort's equal. In the same scene, Timothy Spall seems almost bored in his portrayal of Wormtail, reacting to the loss of his hand with as little pain or emotion as one would scratching an itch. He literally doesn't seem to feel it.I could go on, but I think I've made my point. Don't go expecting the magic of the first three films; it's gone, and only a severe rearrangement of cast, director and editor will bring it back if this franchise hopes to survive. If you must see it in a theater (and for all its faults, I recommend doing that at least once), see it in a matinée or better yet, wait until it's in a dollar theater."", '\'\'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\'\' is the best of all Harry Potter movies of all(at least until now),and also the only one that I gave a vote bigger then 7. As all my Harry Potter comments, I need to say again that the book is so much better and has much more details who are important in the series, but this is the first of all movies who really deserve my applause. The effects are better, the cast looks more comfortable in their respective roles and even being a summary of the books,\'\'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\'\' finally was a good movie. Of course that since the fourth book is very big, many, MANY parts are not showed in the movie,including details about the relationship between Cedric and Harry and also when Harry was in the Quidditch World Cup.aka ""Harry Potter e o Cálice de Fogo"" - Brazil', 'As a huge fan of the books, we have to keep this in context. This is a movie, there is no way it could have included all of the book. I use the movies as fillers between the books, entertaining, but just fillers. That said, there were some glaring omissions that are vital to the next book. Why did Mike Newell extend the dragon scene, but leave out key characters? - because mistakenly Hollywood thinks that such exciting CGI is more important to the fans of the books than expanding characters and plot details. Wrong. But we will go and see the movie anyway.I felt the movie was chopped up. The Quiddich World Cup while fascinatingly done in the movie was over so quickly that it barely seemed to be a part of the plot. Mr Crouch is suddenly dead, but it is just left dangling. Why bother to have Sirius in the movie at all, his brief scene in the fire was really disappointing, his head should have been fully out of the embers, as in the book, not part of the embers. He was barely recognizable as Sirius. What a waste.No Ludo, no Winky and Dumbledore looking like a bumbling idiot rather than the world\'s most powerful wizard. Most importantly the whole end of the book is gone where he has a parting of the ways with Fudge and the Ministry of Magic, because of Fudge\'s refusal to believe that Voldermort is back. This whole scene sets up the next book.So where does this movie adaptation shine? In the script and the impeccable casting. Despite what some have said about Daniel Radcliffe, he IS Harry. From the first movie, his sweet innocence to how he has grown into the part, he remains the face I see when I read the books. Emma Watson needs to tone down her overacting a bit, she was near perfect in the first movie, but hasn\'t really developed her character much. Rupert Grint really shines in this movie, his face is handsome, and funny and full of expression, he is the perfect Ron. The Phelps boys, as Fred & George really come into their own in this movie although how they are to start their joke shop without Harry\'s Tri-wizard winnings in film #5, is a question since it was entirely missing from the movie. And it was nice to see Neville getting a bigger more important role, even though all of his key info was left out of the movie. And now I\'ve read book six, Snape takes on a whole new meaning to me and again Alan Rickman has been the perfect Snape in all of the movies.The question as to whether the three main characters should remain on after the release of the 5th movie in summer 2007 seems a dumb question to me. Since when has Hollywood ever cared about the age of an actor and the part he or she is playing? How often have we had 20 somethings playing teenagers! There comes a time when the age of Daniel, Emma and Rupert will not matter to the audience. Personally I hope that they play in all of the movies.They say that JK Rowling has a big say in what stays in and what is left out of her books, because she alone knows what happens and how each piece of the jigsaw fits. She must have been on holiday when decisions were made for this movie. Perhaps ""the Director\'s Cut"" DVD will explain that also...', 'There are a lot of things wrong with this movie and the part that\'s really wrong are the characters. 1000 words aren\'t enough to explain everything so I\'ll have to be brief. The worst character is Dumbledore. What version of him Kloves & Newell see I have no idea.. I mean, have they read the books at all? Would Albus Dumbledore, one of the greatest wizards alive manhandle one of his own students, especially his favorite student? I should think not. Would he use Harry as bait to lure Voldemort out of hiding? Same answer as above, NO. Gambon can\'t play him to save his life, Richard Harris could, he had the twinkle in his eyes... something that makes Dumbledore so special. Gambon just comes off as a lunatic.If it isn\'t broken, why change it? So why change the first task? Why is Harry getting attacked by the dragon as soon as he leaves the tent? In the book he get\'s on his Firebolt first... he doesn\'t run around and almost die for 5 minutes. But then, finally he\'s in the air and I thought they\'d stick to what\'s in the book but no. There is a chain instead of the dragon being a nesting mother, protecting its eggs. Instead of Harry luring the dragon to get airborne by gently guiding it upwards, teasing it, tempting it, we get this chain that breaks (What happened to the new security measures?) and a stupid dragon that forgets it can fly and has to climb instead.The second task. This is where a part of me died inside. When Harry get\'s pushed in by Moody and doesn\'t re-surface at once Neville goes South Park. ""Oh my god, I killed Harry Potter!"". I\'m sorry but Kloves, Newell or just about ANYONE involved in the making of this movie, how on earth could you let him say that! South Park quotes, although hilarious and one of my absolute favorite shows of all time has no right to be in a HP movie! Didn\'t you think we\'d notice!? *exhale, calm down* The third task. What happened to the Sphinx? What about the Acromantula, we do know they exist thanks to Chris Columbus, why couldn\'t Harry help Cedric out there instead? So you skipped the Blast-Ended Screwts but you could have at least given us one of the other two...The graveyard. This scene is very right and very wrong at the same time. Wormtail (Who was just awful in PoA) is just as bad here, and what is wrong with the other Death Eaters? Wormtail including the others are terrified that Voldemort is actually back! One of them flings himself onto the ground, crawling towards Voldemort while begging for forgiveness and kissing his robes, and get\'s tortured in the book. I think Ralph does a good job of Voldemort, since the make up or whatever they used makes it hard for him to really use his face which is basically the real problem. Where are those red slits for eyes? They\'re what really makes him creepy in the book... but then again (Yes Kloves & Newell, I\'m pointing at you) where is his thirst for repayment of his 13 lost years? I didn\'t see it at all. There is also a BIG problem with the name Voldemort. It is said out loud at the QWC after the Death Eaters have had a go at the tents but no one shudders? They don\'t even use You-Know-Who, they actually say Voldemort? Where\'s the gasps when Dumbledore says Voldemort in front of the whole school? This is something established so early in the series, did you actually forget it?Why is Harry wearing the newest Levis jeans... what happened to him wearing Dudleys old cast-offs? Perhaps Hermione has done some shopping for him since she apparently has taken a liking to pink clothes.. what was wrong with the blue dress she had in the book? Is blue a more expensive color to make a dress in or something? Or is it because we have to see her girlie side in GoF? First you took her bushy hair... now the pink dress.. I don\'t even want to know what\'s going to happen to her in Order of the Phoenix. Also, who the hell was Nigel? Why not use Colin or Dennis Creevey? They\'re already established characters for gods sake! What happened to Filch? When did he stop being bitter, evil and quite frankly a real bastard? He\'s the caretaker that wants to whip students, hang them from their ankles in the dungeons dammit, not some idiot jumping around and firing off cannons... and why on earth is McGonagall teaching them how to dance? Would she order a student to place his hand on her waist? I don\'t think so... even if you haven\'t read the books you must have noticed that she\'d never do that.I think the only good thing about this whole movie was Ginny. She showed me that she can act (She just didn\'t get much screen time in Chamber of Secrets, even if she was very promising), that she\'s sweet and has a temper! Finally a character that\'s actually working! Although I really did miss the moment where Ron suggests that she can go with Harry to the Yule-Ball. Sure, there\'s action, there\'s cool special effects but it\'s just not what the STORY is about and the story is what makes Harry Potter special, something more then your regular Hollywood script action movie. It, just like PoA get\'s an extremely well deserved 1.', ""I thought the movie was great. But there are a few things missing that were in the book. If you haven't seen the movie I advise you not to read this. For example Dobbi and Winky were not even mentioned and they were in the book quite a bit. Also Syreus was only in the movie for about 1 minute and that was very disappointing. There were so many differences from book to movie that I can't possibly name them all. My advice is to see the movie before you read the book so you don't feel disappointed. I went into the theater really looking forward to a few particular things that were in the book. And when they weren't shown I remember thinking who the heck wrote the screen play."", 'I have to say that I disagree with almost every review posted here. I traveled for an hour to see the movie at midnight, for the first showing. I am a huge Harry Potter fan and have been eagerly awaiting the release of this film. How disappointed I was. I must say that I think that the fourth book is perhaps the weakest in the series, but it is still a good read. The movie, however, was by far the worst yet. So many important details were left out, the movie raced along trying to fit as much plot into two and a half hours as possible. Of course there was excitement, funny moments,and talented acting. But overall, the plot moved so quickly, that one barely felt any connection to the characters involved other than what has been built up from the last three movies and the book. The Yule Ball was ridiculous, and Hermione (Emma Watson) was overly dramatic. The challenges in the Tri-Wizard Tournament were rushed through and the other competitors characters were not built up. You barely know, yet alone feel anything about Viktor Krum, Fleur, or even Cedric Diggory. The special effects were great, but could not make up for the loss of the ""magic"" felt in the books and other movies. The final scene with Voldemort was well-done. Scary, suspenseful, exciting. But I must say I will not be seeing this movie again in the theaters as I have the last three.', ""I liked this film very much. It is much darker than the previous outings, but not as faithful to the source material. The only thing I didn't like so much about the book, was the subplot about Hermione trying to help house elves. It was cute, but interfered too much with the dark overtones of the narratives. The film looks dazzling, especially the ballroom scene. Speaking of that scene, I adored that dress that Hermione was wearing, Emma Watson looked unrecognisable in that scene.Also the music by Patrick Doyle this time was beautiful. I don't think it's as dark as the book, and I wasn't too keen on some of the casting. Roger Lloyd Pack and David Tennant were fine in their roles as the Crouches, but their characters were changed significantly. I did wish they made Crouch's disappearance more mysterious, instead of giving it away, ruining the suspense that was quite compelling up to that scene. I am not too keen on Michael Gambon's Dumbledore, I just don't remember Dumbledore being violent as they made him. As I've said already, I much prefer Richard Harris as the character. I am also on the fence about Mad Eye Moody. Brendan Gleeson is a very talented actor, evident in films like In Bruges and The General. He looked the part, but his voice wasn't exactly what I had in mind for Moody. I have listened to the audio tapes by Stephen Fry, and I imagine Moody's voice as low and gravelly. Although Gleeson mostly succeeded with his role, I personally think he tried too hard. My brother also noted that he didn't like the execution of the three tasks. I didn't like the third task, and the other two were fine. I did think on a positive note that Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort was suitably scary, and with the exception of Dumbledore everyone else was well done. All in all, a flawed but quite engrossing film, that doesn't quite live up to the darkness of the book. 8/10 Bethany Cox"", ""This is the worst conversion of book to screenplay in the whole series. From the first scene where there are characters in the movie scene that are not in the book scene, to added scenes in the storyline, to radically changed scenes in the triwizard trials, this screenplay bares only a passing resemblance to the book. The book was fine, and had plenty of drama and excitement at the needed times. there was no need to rewrite the story, only trim it down for runtime.I was very disappointed watching this, and surprised to see that it was the same screenwriter as the first three films, since this was of such substantially lower quality.And the director completely wasted Brendan Gleeson as Moody. This is an incredibly talented actor, and should have been an anchor of the movie. instead, he's almost nothing like the character in the book, even going as far as substituting a metal leg for the wood one. he's practically a footnote to the whole movie.And the final showdown in the graveyard felt incredibly rushed. there's been four movies and 1500 pages of book building to this scene, the scene were everyone finally sees Voldemort in the flesh, and watches him duel with Harry. this should have been a powerful climax, yet is over almost as soon as it's begun.bottom line, get a new director, and a new screenwriter for the next one. if the climax at the Ministry of Magic is as bad as the climax of this movie, the series will lose a lot of fans."", ""First of all, I must mention that Goblet of Fire is my favourite Harry Potter book, and so I expected great things from this movie. And great things I did get, but they were entirely unexpected.The movie starts off with Harry being shaken awake by Hermione in The Burrow. This itself gives us a glimpse into Mike Newell's thought process. Mike Newell and writer Steve Kloves seem to be Harry/Hermione advocators to a small extent. It's not so much as the fact that they show Harry and Hermione to be better friends than Ron and Hermione, which isn't really true to the books, it more the fact that they've made Hermione tag along or take care of Harry in several scenes.As the subject matter of the Goblet of Fire book was too vast, many scenes in the movie have been sliced so that it deals with action rather than explanations. In a way, this works. On the other hand, Potter fans will surely expect some more details, and this, I predict will be the main negative response to Newell's work. The end particularly requires an explanation. Newell leaves things a bit up in the air. But this doesn't mean the movie is bad or disappointing. At least not for me. It is filled with laugh-out-loud moments, thrilling action sequences and a few new surprises that will captivate you. Truly, It has some wonderful scenes which seem like they've been plucked from your imagination. Voldemort's rebirth for instance.And speaking of Voldemort, I must say Ralph Fiennes has done a remarkable job. The make up artist and computer animation guys must have worked hard too \x96 Voldemort looks just as evil and scary as he should! This is one of the reasons that the movie has received a PG-13 rating. The highly suggestive yet hilarious scene in the Prefects bathroom, as well as a few very suggestive dialogues here and there also explain the rating.The movie's casting has been tastefully done. The new actors have managed to remain true to the characters that they play, and are very believable. Miranda Richardson makes a fantastic Rita Skeeter. Stanislav Ianevski (Krum) and Robert Pattinson (Cedric) are well cast and play their roles well. Clémence Poésy makes a good Fleur Delacour, but Mike Newell should have let her keep her hair down.Unexpectedly, Matthew Lewis and Brendan Gleeson gave very good performances. Matthew Lewis, although he has grown out of his short and pudgy first-movie form and has become tall and slim, has nonetheless managed to keep Neville alive and kicking. There are many funny scenes as well as scenes that can only be described as 'cute' involving him. As for Brendan Gleeson, I didn't think much of him as 'Mad-Eye' Moody when I saw the trailers and the teaser pictures. But he makes a great Moody, crazy, loud and sometimes scary.There was much debate about the casting of Frances de la Tour as Madame Maxime as many seemed to think that she didn't fit the part. I can see their point, since she isn't the best Maxime they could have got, but she wasn't too bad. Pedja Bjelac (also known as Predrag, in case you're wondering) made a wonderful Karkaroff.As for the carry-over actors from the last movie into this one, I have to say that I am most impressed with Emma Watson's performance. (and of course Matthew Lewis, whom I have already mentioned.) Emma manages to capture the essence of 14-year-old Hermione quite well. Rupert Grint gives his 100% Ron. Sometimes it's hard not to imagine Ron as Rupert while reading the books. Daniel Radcliffe, the 'star' himself, has greatly improved in terms of acting since Prisoner of Azkaban and, although his performance is uneven, he still manages to be a convincing Harry. The Phelps Twins are remarkable as Fred and George and entertain with their hilarious banter and excellent screen presence. Bonnie Wright (Ginny) has a bigger role in this movie than in any of the others. She has almost no dialogue, but is present in many scenes here and there, which is something. Tom Felton, too, has a very small role. In fact he's only present in three scenes, one of which I am pleased to announce involves Professor Moody! But enough about the talented actors that have been a part of this magical movie. What about the scenes everyone has been waiting to see? Are they well done? What has been kept? What has been cut? I'm afraid you'll have to see the movie for that. If I begin to dissect this movie into what was well done and what wasn't, this review will probably be 8 pages long. All I can say is that this movie will make you feel happy, sad, anxious and surprised at the same time. It will make you laugh out loud, jump in surprise and gasp all at once. Prepare yourselves for a ride filled with mixed emotions. It's advisable to be prepared \x96 This ride can get very overwhelming!"", 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - Harry (Dan Radcliffe) enters his fourth year of Hogwarts and is entered into the incredibly dangerous Triwizard tournament by an anonymous stranger. All hail to Mike Newell, the director of this masterpiece! The movie forgoes the happiness and frivolity of the previous movies and replaces it with teen problems (done very funnily of course), epic action sequences and hilarious British humor.Coming back to the show are the fantastic three. Dan has come into his own. He is Harry. He is vulnerable, angry, not always sure what to do, and has actually gotten quite good at comedy routines. Rupert Grint is not just used for comedic relief this time. He gets jealous of Harry for getting into the tournament, and is tired of being referred to as ""Harry Potter\'s Stupid Friend"". Emma Watson is beautiful and plays the supporter of Harry largely, but does it well. The other children are a blast to watch, especially Neville and Fred and George. I liked how more attention came to the character of Cedric Diggory, and his brief relationship to Harry.The adult actors are sparingly but well used. Alan Rickman only has two main scenes (He probably did about one day of filming) but it\'s just enough. Maggie Smith is equally funny and Micheal Gambon is used more than in the previous film. He thankfully has one fatherly scene in this film, which was lacking in PoA. Brendan Gleeson is hilariously over-the-top as ""Mad-Eye"", a vicious old dark wizard catcher assigned to be the new Dark Arts teacher.The humor has grown more adult, which fits the growing audience better. Sexuality and Excellent Writing replace most of the repetition gags and silly physical humor of Columbus and Cuaron. This fits J.K. Rowling\'s style much better actually. It\'s all very funny and very British, as it should be. As for the teen problems? Getting a date for the dance, and learning to dance. Dealing with rejection and hormones. We\'ve all been there. It\'s all very real and well done. These kids feel like real people, not mythical elves or gods.The movie is close to 3 hours, but chances are you\'ll spend most of it either laughing or terrified. Harry\'s round with the dragon is intensely scary but amazing. His second task, slightly less so, but the dragon was a tough act to follow. The maze is scary, easily a villain by itself. Think ""The Shining"" on crack. The finale will leave pretty much anyone with a soul breathless and crying. Ralph Fiennes is terrifying as Voldemort. Dark times indeed.Not for anyone who hasn\'t seen the other movies or read the books (or doesn\'t want to because it\'s not ""cool""), but who gives a crap about them? Not for kids under 12 (they\'ll go to see it anyway, I\'ve seen 7 year olds read the 6th book), but this stuff is scary for anyone. Diehards who want every side-plot of the book included will be disappointed. C\'mon guys, the movie\'s almost 3 hours anyway (Though I was genuinely disappointed at the lack of further exposition about Neville Longbottom)! The movie does the best at being comprehensible without aid of reference from the books of it\'s predecessors, and is a genuinely exceptional comedy/thriller, and feels epic and yet real. And that\'s a tall order to deliver for a story about magic and a wizard. Mike Newell is a god truly.Not for the faint of heart, this gets an A', ""I'd hate to face the task of condensing a 700 page book into a movie - even a two and a half hour movie, but they've managed pretty well with this installment of the adventures of Harry Potter.For fans of the movies, you'll find this installment a little darker, a little grittier, and a little more involving. The characters are growing up and are now facing more adult situations with more adult outlooks.For fans of the books, you should find this adaptation a commendable reflection of Rowling's tale. Naturally, some parts had to be modified or cut entirely - there's no way to avoid that without making it a 10 hour movie - but the parts that were cut were either not critical to the story line, or will be easy to account for in the films to come. Unless you're an obsessive nitpicker about every last detail, you should find this a satisfactory film version of Goblet of Fire.Goblet of Fire works well as a stand-alone film, as a film version of Rowling's book, and is in my opinion quite easily the best Potter movie yet."", ""While Prisoner was a step forward I alway felt like the film adaptation of Goblet was a step back simply due to time. Goblet really should be longer to cover all the stuff going on here. Yes, we have the games but in order to do that right the whole movie has to be about that. There's not enough time to explore all the other stuff going on here, the relationships shifting and adapting, the mystery of what's going on. None of this feels more epitomized than in the relationship of Ron and Harry. Best buddies up until now and yet, suddenly they're fed up with each other. I understand the reasoning of it all but it doesn't feel like the film is allowed to live in that enough to make the reactions feel reasonable or earned.Goblet of fire is still decent, it just doesn't feel like a step forward for the series. It's entirely necessary but doesn't progress or amp up in a meaningful enough way. Not that it really matters because at this point you're likely 3-4 movies in and you're either going to see this through or you're not. Just know that it gets progressively better from here."", ""first off this was a sloppy fast tracked Hollywood (get it out for the holidays) project . if you read the book or listened to the audio book you would know what i mean. right from the beginning it is wrong no tavern scene , harry wakes up at at ron's house from the dream ? no durdleys no fireplace pickup to take harry to the world cup . no house elfs liberation front no actual showing of serious black . i understand that to make this book a movie it would have to be 5 hours long but honestly the dragon scene is nothing like the book you never see anyone but harry fight a dragon. Harry's dragon scene was added to not like the book the dragon does not land on a roof or chase harry through the country side ... I hope when you see this movie you buy the book and read it cover to cover i guarantee you a much better experience . of all the books and movies this one leaves the most out . and to see dumbledoor running around like a nervous idiot is just wrong . trust me if you are a true fan you will be extremely disappointed like i am . get peter jackson to do the rest of the movies (someone with attention to detail )"", 'TO be honest, this was my favourite book of all of them so far and frankly i was shocked at how terrible it really was. For gods sake will you choose a SUITBALE Dumbledore?? Its really depressing to see a wannabee actor playing the great wizard. All the good parts were missing from the book!! We didn\'t see David Tennant have his soul sucked which was rubbish, for goodness sake, get it together with amateur acting man!! I wasted my money and I certainly won\'t be buying this twaddle on DVD. I hope they pick it up for the next one as I immensely enjoyed ""The Order Of The Phoneix"" and its structure. I advise anyone with a likeness to the book, PLEASE Don\'t SEE IT!!!!', ""I must say I am extremely sick of this movie, though not for conventional reasons. Nine reels is a lot to put together and screening a three hour movie can be exhausting, especially when you're trying to write several term papers during the same week it is coming out. You see, I am a projectionist and getting this movie ready for a midnight show was part of my job. I realize that the fact that I was paid $14.50/hr to watch this movie on Wednesday night might give rise to feelings of jealousy among some, but I am currently wishing I could manage to get more than five hours of sleep sometime soon.All that said I must say this was by far the greatest Harry Potter film so far. Although it was long, it did not drag on. It had a nice, tight feel to it. It progressed from scene to scene with a smoothness that I find to be lacking in many movies adapted from books. The acting has noticeably improved from the first three, and the more adult feel to this one really drew me in. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of this movie was the fact that it felt like a mix of genres. It had an epic feel to it. After all it is about good v. evil and battling the dark wizards, etc. This movie,however, also felt like a high school movie. It had the issues of coming of age, which makes sense as the characters begin to mature. Ultimately it came off a lot more loyal to the book in theme than I think the last one did. (The first two, while loyal, I found to be relatively campy and childish.) This movie, like many, does have its shortfalls. I believe that Dumbledore was portrayed as a little too intense, like an old Al Pacino. Instead of the benevolent, kind, and good-humored old man I have always loved in the books. As someone that has read the books, I must say another shortfall is that this movie banks on familiarity with the story. Having read the books, I found it very easy to follow, but I could understand how one who has not read the books may feel a bit lost, as some important information was left out and some back-story was left mostly unexplained.All in all I would say this is definitely the best movie in this series so far, and if the next three are on par with this one then I would be content."", 'What summed this film up for me was the comments of my non-HP book reader wife and friend. ""Didn\'t really understand it"".The JKR books are full of ""tells"" and explanations, with sub-plots taking on great significance later on. The book of Goblet of Fire is central to the denouement of many of these - and in the main they are left out of the film version in favour of action and CGI.That said, it was not all bad, so I\'ll highlight what I liked first! The teenagers\' awkwardness as they explore their relationships, and the way this was handled in the build up to and the actual Ball scene. Hermione in particular was well portrayed, and Ron and Harry sitting like wallflowers while the rest of the school dance the night away was well done. The look on McGonagall\'s face when she sees Ron\'s dress robes - priceless. The Moaning Myrtle scene in the Prefect\'s bath is excellent, funny and well acted. Mad Eye Moody was excellent, convincing and menacing. The opening scene showing the splendour of the Quidditch stadium was breathtaking. The graveyard scenes at the end were well done, and close to the book. Ralph Fiennes was excellent, if a little too ""strong"" to be credible so soon after his rebirth.What did they do badly? Quite a lot actually. I realise how hard it must be to condense this long book into a 150 minute movie, but overextended scenes could have been shortened, and 20 minutes extra to cover some key current and future story lines would have been time and money well spent. Dumbledore is mad! What has Gambon done to him? Would Richard Harris have grabbed Harry by the neck and shaken him, shouted at him? Would Harris be mumbling and doubting of his abilities, such that there is now almost no credibility that Voldemort should ever fear him? No. And neither does the Dumbledore of JKR. No muggle taunting and no house elf in the Quidditch world cup scenes, meaning no explanation of the purpose of the riot and burning of the tented village, and no set-up of Bartie Crouch Senior as a key character. No mention at all of SPEW. The dragon fight scene is ridiculously long, and ridiculously expensive. Harry flies right out of the stadium, chased by the Norwegian Horntail on a trip to demolish large parts of the castle roofing tiles. The dragon can fly, for goodness sake - why would it spend 2 minutes climbing across rooftops to get to Harry when it could fly out and blast him from the air? The characterisation of the new characters is poor - Fleur, Viktor and Cedric are all just cardboard cutouts for Harry to battle against. The omission of almost all the interaction between Harry and Sirius, so crucial to the next two films. Make you wonder whether the film makers have actually read all the books. The absence of any reference to Hagrid\'s half-giant heritage (subtly alluded to in one scene with Madam Maxime, but only if you know what you\'re looking for) which is so important to his role in the next film No mention of the Minister For Magic\'s denial of Voldemort\'s return, nor his act of bringing the dementors to kill Bartie Crouch junior before Snape can use Veritas serum to make him confirm Harry\'s story - both key to Dumbledore\'s flight in the next book, and setting up for Umbridge to wreak her havoc. A messy treatment of the Snape/Karkaroff relationship and history, again failing to set up the future doubts we have about Snape, who is still mainly just portrayed as a nasty teacher rather than key character of the 6th book. The acting. Sad though I am to say it I thought most of the acting was poor in this film, especially from Emma Watson (who I\'ve always thought was the best of the young actors) and Rupert Grint. To be fair this is probably more due to their hugely diminished parts in this film, but that aside I feel Hermione is portrayed more as Harry\'s mother figure, rather than the super-clever heroine who Harry can always rely on to get him back on track. The Rita Skeeter storyline is shallow, with no set-up for the essential article in support of Harry, and no mention of her being an illegal animagus, and thus no capture and blackmail of her by Hermione. The Maze is transformed from testing puzzles and magical scenarios that the 4 Champion\'s could reasonably expect to figure out/defeat, to a series of menacing hedges and roots that becomes the entirety of the final test. The winner just needs to be luckier and faster than the others - leaving no avenue for true Wizarding contest, nor for Moody\'s sabotage of Fleur and Viktor\'s efforts. Finally (though I could go on) I was amazed that a director of Newell\'s status and past history should make Fleur such a lame character, fit only to be dressed in a skimpy swimming costume, and swiftly fail, with no explanation, in all the tasks.As I\'ve said, I sympathise with how hard it must be to condense such a long book and not miss out big chunks of it - and I think they did that quite well with the start - but I do feel they erred too much on the side of spectacle and not enough on explaining all the plot twists and lead-ins to the next book.What will non-book readers make of it all!Tony', 'this movie was horrible. all that you get from it is a very basic plot outline. there are huge time gaps, changes in scenes, and total disregard for what happens in the book. all of the subtle nuances that make the harry potter series great are missing from this movie. some scenes are completely changed from the book. the horntail scene, world cup scene, and many many others are completely redone. this being said, there were some impressive CGI effects done. the world cup stadium, though they do not seat harry and his friends in the correct place, and do not show the match its self (which was personally very disappointing, because i had been looking forward to seeing the match quite a lot) is, as a CGI work alone, very impressive, as is the maze at the end. despite these minor interesting details, the majority of the movie is very poorly done in relation to the book. accordingly, this is easily the worst of the four movies released to date.', ""It was toooooo rushed. The length of this book should have been matched with a movie the caliber of the lord of the rings movies. It was too unfaithful to the books and left out many characters or made them too small. Rita Skeeter was barely in it, you didn't feel the evil that should have emanated from her. Plus, nothing happened to her at the end. If these movies are to be the standard for Harry Potter movies to come, true fans should be disgusted. Dobby, Winky, Ludo Bagman, Hogwarts classes in general, other students, the Dursleys, Ton-Tongue toffees, all gone. Shunted to the side was the whole graveyard scene, Voldemort wasn't scary at all, Dumbledore was almost violent to Harry. Overall, there wasn't enough time in the film to give the characters their due limelight. With Rita Skeeter not caught, no Winky, Sirius almost non-existent, the next movie will probably sink as low as this one and its predecessors. If these books are so long, the movies should be made longer."", 'Harry, Ron and Hermione enter their fourth year at Hogwarts. After having a strange dream of the Dark Lord and his Death Eaters, Harry Potter awakes at the Weasleys\' house where they shortly depart for the 422nd Quidditch World Cup. After the match, the camp is attacked by Death Eaters. The three later arrive at Hogwarts, where they find that the magical school will be hosting a legendary event called the Triwizard Tournament, in which one wizard each from two rival schools and Hogwarts will compete in three dangerous tasks. When the schools of Beauxbatons and Durmstrang, the rival schools, arrive, the rules are announced. Meanwhile, Alastor ""Mad Eye"" Moody arrives at Hogwarts at the request of Dumbledore to be the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. Moody is a very eccentric man, noted for his paranoia and his wildly roaming ""mad eye"". People over seventeen who are interested must insert their name into the Goblet of Fire, and those chosen will be the Champions of their respective school. Three champions\' names come out of the Goblet of Fire, Cedric Diggory from Hogwarts, Viktor Krum from Durmstrang and Fleur Delacour from Beauxbatons, and then the goblet unexpectedly produces a fourth, Harry Potter, although he is an under-age fourth year who never entered. Although Harry insists that he did not enter his name, his selection prompts a certain amount of jealousy and suspicion on part of his fellow students - including Ron, who believes that Harry is attempting to make himself the centre of attention again. This causes a brief period of resentment and estrangement between the two friends (including Ron swearing, telling Harry to piss off!), which is soon healed, however. Dumbledore tells Alastor to keep an eye on Harry, without him knowing it.The Tournament begins with the first event, in which the four champions must each battle a dragon to retrieve a golden egg. Upon using the Accio spell to summon his broom, he flies out of the arena. The dragon breaks free of its chain and chases Harry through the Hogwarts grounds, where it runs into a stone bridge and falls dead. Harry gets the egg, which, when opened, will reveal a clue about the second task. When Harry opens it, though, only a horrible screeching is heard. They are soon informed of the Yule Ball, a Christmas ball held during the Triwizard Tournament. Ron and Harry find it hard to get dates to the ball, but finally get the Patil twins to join them, while Hermione goes with Viktor Krum, stunning everyone with her suddenly beautiful appearance at the ball. Ron is so jealously enraged at seeing Hermione with Krum (formerly his idol) that he attacks her and accuses her of ""fraternizing with the enemy"". The ensuing argument leaves Hermione in tears (in the film version only).Cedric Diggory, the other Hogwarts champion, informs Harry to submerge the egg in water and open it. There he will hear the clue. Harry does as told in the prefects\' enormous collective bath. The clue mentions that merpeople have taken something of Harry\'s and that they must retrieve it from the Black Lake. Just as the three are trying to find a way to breathe underwater, Ron and Hermione are called to McGonagall\'s office. Neville tells Harry about gillyweed, which, if eaten, can let you grow webbed hands and feet and gills. During the second task, Harry follows a mermaid to where they have chained Ron, Hermione, Cho Chang, and Fleur\'s sister. Cho Chang is retrieved by Cedric, Victor, the Durmstrang champion, takes Hermione. Harry takes both Ron and Fleur\'s sister, since she did not show up.Finally, the third task arrives. A huge maze has been set up, in the center of which is the Triwizard Cup. The first to touch the cup wins the task. Dumbledore allows Harry and Cedric to be led into the woods first, because they both received first and second place in the previous task. Both Cedric and Harry grab the cup at the same time. The cup, which is actually a portkey, sends the two to a graveyard, where Wormtail appears with a form of Voldemort. Upon command, Wormtail kills Cedric and binds Harry to a tombstone. Wormtail performs a spell over a burning cauldron and drops Voldemort into it. A fully revived Voldemort emerges from it and summons the Death Eaters with the Dark Mark. After explaining to them how he lost his powers to Harry, he duels Harry Potter, in which their spells join in a chain. Harry breaks the chain and gets Cedric\'s body. After grabbing the cup again, he is transported back to the school where everyone learns that the Dark Lord is back and has killed Cedric. Mad-Eye Moody takes Harry to his office in order to help Harry calm down. Moody suddenly starts to change his appearance when he learns that he has run out of Polyjuice Potion. Moody tells Harry that it was he who told Hagrid to lead Harry into the woods and tell him about dragons. Moody also reveals that it was he who told Cedric to open the egg underwater and that he gave Neville the book that led him straight to discovering gillyweed in it. Harry realizes that Moody put his name in the Goblet of Fire and that he bewitched Krum. As Moody is about to kill Harry, Dumbledore, Snape, and McGonagall burst in the room and save Harry. Dumbledore makes Moody admit that he is an imposter and that the real Moody is locked in a chest. The imposter rapidly changes from appearing like Moody to his own appearance, Barty Crouch Jr, a Death Eater working for Voldemort. The tournament ends and the other schools depart.']"
58,Wizarding World,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,373889,"[""My most obvious flaw was that at the beginning, the actors looked as though they had been computerised, and I personally found that very distracting, with the scene with the dementors, it just seems strangely executed. Another flaw is that I am still not a huge fan of Michael Gambon's Dumbledore. He isn't a bad actor, but he doesn't quite fit the bill of Dumbledore, and there were some scenes with him that seemed rather strange. However, putting the flaws aside, we do have a lovely-looking film, with very good special effects, and excellent cinematography. As for the acting, I was impressed. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are still likable, as is Robbie Coltrane. Alan Rickman is very suave and dour as Snape, but the acting honours do go to Imelda Staunton as Umbridge. I have read the book, and do prefer it, as there was a lot missed out in the film. My favourite scene was the Department of Mysteries scene, because some of that was creepy, with Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix. No one could have done that better. All in all, a lovely looking film, with some flaws in the first half. 8/10 Bethany Cox."", ""I used to like the HARRY POTTER movies and books – the first three at least. They were everything I expected from children's entertainment. Then the books started getting longer, it was obvious Rowling was only doing them for the money, and I personally believe they should have ended with the fourth book, as the last three add absolutely nothing to the storyline apart from extraneous detail. The same goes with the films.The first two were fluffy entertainment, the third was my favourite and I hated the fourth because they'd changed so much. This film, the fifth in the series, is the worst yet, a total artistic failure. The reason is totally down to Rowling. The fifth book is overlong and bloated at nearly a thousand pages; much of what happens is totally irrelevant and utterly pointless. The filmmakers were left with the difficult decision of what to leave out and what to put in, and it's this choice that scuppers them.We're left with a series of vignettes snipped from the pages. There are a couple of scenes here, a couple of scenes there, and the majority of the supporting cast members get about five lines. The likes of Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane, David Thewlis, Robert Hardy, Richard Griffiths, Brendan Gleeson, Helena Bonham Carter, and Ralph Fiennes are all totally wasted in blink-and-you'll-miss-'em cameos. The central trio of Harry, Hermione and Ron are unappealing and face no character progression other than silly, goes-nowhere romance for Harry.Two actors come out of this well – Gary Oldman seems to be enjoying himself as Sirius and Imelda Staunton is hissably evil as the new teacher – but other than them, nobody gets a chance here. The film looks pretty, for sure, and there's no faulting the special effects, but in the end this is a whole lot of sound and fury that signifies nothing. At the end, the story has progressed no further than it had at the beginning other than in a few minor points."", ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007) ** 1/2 (out of 4)Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is brought back to school where he faces a possible expulsion after using magic in the real world. Dumbledore (Jim McManus) comes to his defense and soon the two of them are warning people of the return of Lord Voldemort.As I've said in the reviews for the previous films, I haven't read any of the stories so I honestly can't compare the movie to the book. With that said, I did find the previous installment to be an extremely entertaining movie and certainly the best of the series to date. This fifth film is certainly a major step backwards and sadly there are way too many boring moments to make it a complete winner.Again, perhaps I would have picked up on more things had I been familiar with the book but I personally found the majority of the first half to be quite boring without too many interesting things going on. I honestly thought there was very little character development and I thought too many of the scenes just kept dragging on with dialogue that just wasn't all that interesting or thrilling.The film does finally pick up during its final act and this is where thing get really good. The final battles almost rival what we saw in the previous film and there's no question that they pack a lot of energy and excitement. They also benefit from some wonderful special effects that really put you in the middle of the action and blend perfectly well with the cast members. Speaking of the cast, a lot of talented actors keep getting added to the series and once again everyone is quite impressive. Regulars like Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman and others return to their roles quite nicely and people like Emma Thompson, Gary Oldman and David Thewlis are of great value."", ""After the encounter with Voldemort at The Triwizard Tournament, opinions are divided on Harry Potter. Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge is determine to squash the news of Voldemort's return, and demonize Potter and Dumbledore. The world is coming down on Potter. First he's charged with underage magic when he fought off 2 dementors. Then he finds that Dumbledore has been keeping his distance. Finally, there's a new strict devious teacher Dolores Umbridge play by the amazing Imelda Staunton.It is truly dark time as Hogwarts fall into the hands of the evil Umbridge from the absent Dumbledore. Potter is convinced to form a group of students to learn magic on their own. More and more, Voldemort is coming out of the shadows. Torturing the students is really a new level of darkness in this series. There is a real sense of evil in this one more than the others. It is mostly due to the performance of Imelda Staunton and her evil character Umbridge. It sets the tone for the series from here on out."", '""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is the fifth from 8 Harry Potter films. It is the first directed by David Yates. So far, directors switched quickly, but Yates continued and returned to the franchise for films 6, 7 and 8. The screenplay comes not from the guy who made it all the other movies based on Rowling\'s novels, but from the writer of ""Peter Pan"", Michael Goldenberg. This is one of 2 (I believe) Harry Potter films that did not score a single Academy Award nomination and were ""only"" honored by BAFTA.The film starts with Potter being put on trial and Dumbledore acting somewhat as his lawyer. Apart from that, this film was pretty interesting because of the introduction of several new relevant female characters. These would be Luna Lovegood, Nymphadora, Dolores Umbridge and Bellatrix Lestrange. Personally, I always found Lovegood the most interesting and best choice for Potter in contrast to that Asian chick and Ron\'s sister. Umbridge is probably my favorite villain in the franchise. She is just so downright evil and all that seemingly nice pink fluffiness surrounding her adds a lot to her creepiness. Admittedly, I found Potter also a bit provoking her initially during their first lesson, but that does not make her less evil and can be seen as a justification for her torturing methods. The only stereotypical thing was how Maggie Smith\'s character was written and the way she portrayed her dislike towards Staunton\'s character on at least two occasions. By the way Umbridge reminded me a bit of the evil queen from ""Alice in Wonderland"" (Bonham Carter\'s approach), but maybe that is just me.One of the most entertaining parts for me (and probably most other lovers of cinema) were the King Kong re-enactments including Umbridge and Hermione. The fight between Dumbledore (water) and ""he who must not be named"" (fire) was also one of the highlights. As was the fate of Oldman\'s character, even if he was not featured as much in this film as before. Apart from that, I also liked the music sequences that reminded me of ""Les Misérables"". ""Order of the Phoenix"" was the fifth most successful film at the box office for 2007 and I definitely recommend watching it, especially for Imelda Staunton\'s magnificent character. Also, I liked that it was not as Potter-centered and putting the focus on him as the huge hero as it was the case in previous films.', 'After defending himself and Dudley Dursley with magic from an attack of the Dementors, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is sent to a hearing and found not guilty from the accusation of inappropriate use of magic in front of humans. Then he returns to Hogwarts and finds that most people do not believe that Voldemort is back. Further, the Ministry of Magic has assigned the annoying and despicable Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) to change the directions in the school affecting the lives of the teachers and mainly the students. She suspends the practical course of self-defense spells, and Harry Potter and his friends Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ronnie (Rupert Grint) form a clandestine group to learn magic with Harry Potter. Meanwhile Harry Potter has horrible visions and nightmares and Severus Snape (Alan Rickman) tells him that he is mentally connected to the Dark Lord, teaching him how to defend from an intrusion in his mind.""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is another entertaining adventure of this young witch and his friends. The top-notch cast, with most of the best British actors and actresses, introduces the stunning Imelda Staunton in the role of a very nasty character and she is amazingly perfect. Contradictorily, the weakest name in these Harry Potter films is the hero and lead actor Daniel Radcliffe, but unfortunately there is no other way to handle the situation. The special effects are state of art and very impressive. My daughter is a big fan of Harry Potter, she reads all his books immediately after the release, and I imagine how difficult is to write an adaptation to the cinema of such number of pages. But for those like me that have not read the book, it works very well. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Harry Potter e a Ordem do Fênix"" (""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"")', 'Another year begins for Harry with more challenges than ever. The Ministry seem intent on having him expelled and it is only some timely interventions that save him \x96 but they come at a cost to those involved. Back at Hogwarts proper and changes are afoot with the addition to the teaching staff of Professor Delores Umbridge as the new Defence against the Dark Arts teacher. Umbridge\'s refusal to actually teach the class sees Harry and his friends secretly practicing themselves but cannot stop her rise to power, displacing Dumbledore. This all occurs while the shadow of Voldemort looms over Harry\'s life.I\'ve still not bothered to read any of these bl00dy books and I\'m rarely that bothered about seeing the newest films but I must confess that the Harry Potter films are often pretty good when I actually do get around to seeing them. It is a surprise then that I\'m not more into them in the way that some other series have held my attention but there you go. Anyway, Order of the Phoenix eventually came to me on DVD and I settled down expecting professional big budget entertainment. And this is what it delivers and it is hard to fault it for what it does \x96 again its failure to really grip me across films is not one I can pin on any one thing and certainly not in this film.For my money the series has got stronger as it has gone along and it does feel like it has become more comfortable in itself and its audience but, rather than complacency that this guaranteed box office might produce the films have worked harder. Phoenix is stronger than Goblet of Fire, which itself was better than the one before (the first two films didn\'t really do a lot for me even if they were ""good""). Opening with a tremendously stylish and gripping extended sequence, the film marks out its darker material from the start. It continues with this pretty well and the happiness and carefree introductions of the first few films are pretty much gone. I imagine that this will not be to the pleasing of parents of young fans but for me the menace and fear is pretty well balanced out, although I\'m not a great judge as for me I like the idea that films meant for children would have dark themes and not just be a collection of soft shapes and bright colours where everything is right with the world in every regard.The story provides some strong set pieces and the series has improved yet again in the area of effects. The final fight sequence producing convincing and engaging effect shots as if it was doing it just for fun. Yates\' direction is effective and he holds well to the look of the other films but yet brings stuff of his own. He doesn\'t let it sag often and the film does feel tighter than earlier ones even if at times the ""bigger picture"" was lost on me as we seemed to have very specific narrative threads going on. The characters are stronger and parts of the cast step up to this; Radcliffe in particular impressed me with his range and he genuinely (and literally) has grown with the role. The supporting cast is as usual deep in British stars but this was not as distracting to me as before. Fiennes is a great force in the background and his limit time is well used. Oldman, Rickman, Smith, Issacs, Thompson, Carter and others all provide quality even in small roles. Staunton is a nice addition and does well in what she has to do even if I felt the film gave too much time to her here and there. The young cast are good in some areas (eg Watson, Grint) but the non-speaking roles are annoyingly overdone with their facial expressions and they bugged me hanging around the edges of action (""ok kids, act INVOLVED!"").Overall though this is a very engaging and enjoyable film that seemed to effortlessly fill the time. Something about the series is still failing to hold me to the long game and I think it is the development of really strong characters but this is getting better as it gets darker. Regardless though the film is very professional with strong effects, starry cast and a consistently engaging plot. More importantly it is better yet again than the film before and is a credit to the series at a time when most film series tend to fade rather than grow.', 'This part 5 of a septology (if that is indeed a word and means series of seven or something like that). You couldn\'t tell by it\'s title (at least I couldn\'t), if you\'re not an avid reader of the books. Which I\'m certainly not (guilty as charged, for not having read any of the Potter books).This one continues the story from the previous movies, also having a short intro in the ""real"" (human?) world (as the other installments had, always in the beginning). This one does have some powerful theme running throughout and yes Harry Potter begins to grow into adulthood (one would/could say). Still not breaking any family friendly rules overall, I\'d say. It\'s a good movie and if you\'ve watched the other four movies, you\'ll watch this one too (there\'s no doubt about it ... 3 more years and two more Potter movies to come)', ""I'm not a reader of the Harry Potter books but I've been watching the film adaptations in order and I'm starting to hit a sticking point. Reading other reviews of this installment in the series I don't feel so bad now that it was somewhat hard to follow for me. The principal characters don't seem to be as engaging as they were when first starting out, and even though that might be a result of the actors getting older in their roles, there's just something elusive that's missing here to make the adventure enjoyable. The situations and dialog seemed to enter clichéd territory a good part of the time, and the overall impression I had when it was over was that I was simply tired of it all. Which doesn't bode well for the remainder of the stories, even though I'm sure enough that I'll go on to finish the films in due time. As usual, great special effects and colorful use of Hogwarts language, but the return of Voldemort wasn't epic, and the introduction of new characters left me uninterested. How about a Petronus charm to liven things up next time."", 'Whereas it\'s been a few years since I read the novel on which this movie is based, I had forgotten a few things, so the movie refreshed my memory. Obviously, any book-to-movie adaptation is bound to have at least a few flaws. ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" certainly can\'t equal the book exactly, but I really like Imelda Staunton\'s role as fascistic Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher Dolores Umbridge (I assume that if you\'re reading this, then you know what that class is; if not, then read the books first). This vile woman, dressed like a slightly drabber version of Jackie Kennedy, makes it her goal to overthrow Albus Dumbledore and totally seize control of Hogwarts,* engaging in all manner of torture when she deems it necessary, all the while sporting an unctuous smirk. Maybe it\'s just me, but I derive that this installment in the series is an indictment of totalitarian regimes.Of course, I might just be reading too far into the movie. I figure that the main purpose is probably to get enthralled in the magic, and it\'s hard not to get enthralled. Admittedly, the younger stars come across as a little silly, as they try to be funny but can\'t really get it down. No matter, the adults all know what they\'re doing. A scary but delicious addition here is Helena Bonham Carter as death eater Bellatrix LeStrange. Looking sort of like Elvira, she turns Bellatrix into the sort of character whom we would expect Bonham Carter to play in a Tim Burton movie, and she does this to a tee; I almost felt scared watching her on screen.Overall, while the movie does have its flaws, I recommend it. I consider it a solid addition in the series. Reprising their roles from the previous installment(s) are Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Richard Griffiths, Fiona Shaw, Michael Gambon, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane, Alan Rickman, David Thewlis, Brendan Gleeson, Gary Oldman, Ralph Fiennes, Jason Isaacs and Warwick Davis.*Not but a few hours after I watched the movie, I heard a report on the news about a newly released tape divulging the extreme hostility that Richard Nixon felt towards George McGovern, even after winning re-election. Well, Dolores Umbridge is even worse.', ""With their warning about Lord Voldemort's return scoffed at, Harry and Dumbledore are targeted by the Wizard authorities as an authoritarian bureaucrat slowly seizes power at Hogwarts.At this point in the series, the story takes a decidedly darker and more sinister turn. This could be because of the subject matter: the students spend less time in class and more time preparing for real world evil. It could also be the introduction of a new crew. Not only has the director changed (again) but the screenplay has a new hand, making the very feel somewhat off. I have not read the books, but I get the impression a great deal was left out to account for time and to make the plot run smoother.The best addition to this film from previously ones is Luna Lovegood. She was apparently in the books for a while as a minor character but did not come on to the movies until now. Her role is fairly small, but important, and her character adds the one bit of lightness to this script (aside from possibly the Weasley's pranks). They cast the perfect actress.What really stands out about this film is how political it is. Parallels could be made between this and the rise of fascism or McCarthyism. There is talk of order, obedience, conformity, the need for a government to have a firm hand and to protect its own butt when damaging information comes to light. We know from the previous film that Voldemort is back, and the Ministry of Magic likely knows it, too. But they go out of their way to deny this and blame other people for terrible acts that have occurred. This political act of protecting a reputation slows down the process of preparing for Voldemort and stands in the way of clearing Sirius Black's name. The outcome could have been much improved and lives could have been spared if the government was simply honest.I believe this to be the weakest film up to this point. I did not care for the shift in spirit (the opening seemed more like a drama than a fantasy film). And i did not like feeling like parts were missing. The plot was almost made too simply, especially compared to prior episodes where mysteries had to be solved. There was no twist or surprise here, just a throwaway film to get you to the next one."", 'I will admit that by this point the films may have become just a little dark for the younger members in the audience, but this fifth instalment in the series is never the less, as with the others, great viewing. Basically Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and his cousin Dudley (Harry Melling) are attacked near Privet Drive by two Dementors, forcing the young wizard to summon the Patronus charm, but of course spells are forbidden by young wizards in the Muggle world. So he is devastated to be told he has been expelled, but he is going to the wizard court in the Ministry of Magic to plead his case, with the help of Professor Albus Dumbledore (Sir Michael Gambon) and other members of the society called the Order of the Pheonix. After being cleared of the charges, he is allowed to go back to Hogwarts with friends Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), and they also meet student Luna Lovegood (Evanna Lynch), and the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton), seen at Harry\'s hearing, and appointed by Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge (Robert Hardy). The Ministry do not believe the claims that Lord Voldermort (Ralph Fiennes) has returned, and Umbridge is severely punishing Harry by forcing him to write with a cursed quill, carving the words ""I must not tell lies"" onto his hand. Her control over the school grows and grows as more rules are brought in on behalf of her and the Ministry, and she is not even teaching the students the right spells and skills in the Dark Arts classes that they will need to fight off any threat coming. Therefore Harry, Ron and Hermoine, along with many other rebellious students, find the secret Room of Requirement that can be hidden away, and they use to become ""Dumbledore\'s Army"" and train their skills, with Harry as teacher. While Dumbledore seems to distance himself from Harry, and he and Cho Chang (Katie Leung) develop romantic feelings that leads to a kiss under the mistletoe, Harry also experiences more nightmares seeing a dark room full of shiny globe prophecies, dark forces attacking Arthur Weasley (Mark Williams) and his godfather Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), so Professor Severus Snape (Alan Rickman) trains him to block out these dark thoughts. The Dark Lord meanwhile is slowly gathering his army, realising nine Death Eaters and Sirius\'s deranged cousin Bellatrix Lestrange (Helena Bonham Carter), known to have killed the parents of Neville Longbottom (Matthew Lewis), from Azkaban prison. After discovering ""Dumbledore\'s Army"" and Dumbledore himself escaping arrest, Umbridge becomes the new Headmistress, and things fall apart even more, until a revolt finally comes in the form of the Weasley twins Fred (James Phelps) and George (Oliver Phelps) causing chaos during an exam with fireworks and flying papers. After this Umbridge threatens the illegal Cruciatus Curse on Harry unless they reveal their intentions, but Hermoine tricks her to follow them into the Dark Forest where the brother of Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), Grawp, and the herd of centaurs get rid of her. Seeing a vision, Harry, Ron, Hermoine, Luna, Neville, and Ginny Weasley (Bonnie Wright) fly to the Ministry of Magic, where Sirius was last seen, and find the Department of Mysteries where thousands of prophecies are kept, including the one revealing truths about Voldermort and Harry\'s fates. Dumbledore\'s Army end up in a small fight against the Death Eaters, including Lucius Malfoy (Jason Isaacs) when he does not get the prophecy they want, and all are eventually caught and threatened to be killed unless Harry hands it over. Just when he does give it to Malfoy all the Order of the Phoenix, including Nymphadora Tonks (Natalia Tena), Kingsley Shacklebolt (Raiders of the Lost Ark\'s George Harris),Professor Remus Lupin (David Thewlis), and Professor Alastor \'Mad-Eye\' Moody (Brendan Gleeson) show up to join the fight, the prophecy is destroyed accidentally, but in the process of battle Bellastrix Lestrange manages to kill Sirius, and Voldermort shows up before she can be tortured by Harry. Dumbledore shows up to have a quick battle with the Dark Lord, and before vanishing he quickly possesses Harry\'s body in the hope of killing him as well, but the love inside the young wizard overpowers and he leaves his body. In the end Fudge and all the Ministry accept that Voldermort has indeed returned, the school returns to form, Dumbledore explains the distancing was because of their connection, and Harry accepts that the prophecy is that he or Voldermort will kill each other in the end. Also starring Fiona Shaw as Petunia Dursley, Richard Griffiths as Vernon Dursley, Dame Maggie Smith as Minerva McGonagall, Julie Walters as Mrs. Weasley, Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy, David Bradley as Argus Filch, Emma Thompson as Professor Sybil Trelawney and Warwick Davis as Filius Flitwick. The casting is spot on, with the young actors still giving great performances, but also the new addition of Staunton normally really nice characters but here actually quite sinister as the Nurse Ratched style teacher, the action is exciting, and as always the special effects really engage you and take you into this magical world, a terrific family fantasy fantasy. It was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Production Design and Best Special Visual Effects. Harry Potter was number 45 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, but he was also number 35 on The 100 Worst Britons (the only fictional person, why?). Very good!', 'If you scan the first hundred reviews of this movie on this website, I think you\'ll see the words ""disappointed"" and ""disappointment"" more than any other adjectives. I, too, found it the same. I have not read any of the books, but I\'ve seen - and enjoyed - the four previous movies, so I expected to full enjoy this one.This film disappointed me because (1) - I felt the story was nothing I could make a lot of sense out of, since I hadn\'t read the 800 or 900-page book. If one didn\'t read the book and knew this story, it was easy to get lost about a number of things in here. The screenplay was ""choppy,"" hard to follow in spots. Some of the things, like the death of Sirius Black, happened so fast I didn\'t know exactly what happened. This was just too uneven and rushed to keep us non-HP readers interested, story-wise; (2) - Harry wasn\'t the nice little kid throughout most of it, and he admitted it - that he was angry most of the time. Well, I agree, and he wasn\'t fun to watch, as he had been in the other films. I am used to a good-kid HP, not an angry teen; (3) - His two closest buddies, Ron and Hermione, looked like they mailed in their roles, especially Ron who looked like he was half-asleep during the film. (Maybe he was pouting because he had so few lines, who knows? I wouldn\'t blame him, frankly.); (4) I get tired of filmmakers giving us the rebel-as-hero and authority figure-as-villain. Enough is enough on that theme, which is so heavy-handedly presented here it becomes ludicrous. (5) If you are going to have a major villain, SHOW him, don\'t hide him for 99 percent of the film, which is what they did here with Voldemort.On the positive side, I DID get enjoyment out of all the little special effects, many of which were humorous and always fun to watch. I got a kick out of many of the new faces in the film, and it also was fun to see some characters we had seen only in perhaps one previous film, such as Emma Thompson\'s teacher role. I also thought the music was outstanding: the best I\'ve heard in the five Potter films. I wonder how many others appreciated it in here?All in all, it was visually fun to watch and hear, as all the HP movies have been, but the story was just not entertaining as much as the others.', 'New episode known as ¨Harry Potter and the philosopher\'s stone¨ deals with Harry Potter and friends fighting dark forces in an amazing adventure .

Davied Yates went on shooting fantasy movies set seventy years before Harry Potter arrives in the marvellous school Hogwarts , such as : Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (2016) and Fantastic Beasts : The Crimes of Grindelwald (2018) . The film is for Harry Potter saga lovers as well as neophyte who have never read J. K. Rowling novels . Well worth watching. The flick will appeal to Harry Potter saga followers. Above average .', ""OK, look, I'm a 62-year-old grandpa, and long ago gave up keeping track of all the story lines in these movies. I enjoyed the first one most, because it introduced me to the characters and the fantasy world that they are in. So I no longer try to keep track of everything, I just sit back and enjoy what I see on the screen.Daniel Radcliffe as most of us have come to see is the embodiment of Harry Potter, the fictional character. He has matured and now has the opportunity to take a leadership role among the young wizards, to fight off the evils that seem to be invading Hogwarts school. Emma Watson is back as Hermione Granger and Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley. The two of them along with Potter make up what is most fun to watch. The rest of the characters, to me, are just there to allow the story to unfold and for Harry, Hermoine, and Ron to save the day. I enjoyed it, but I suspect only die-hard Potter fans can get the full benefit of the movies anymore."", 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix has a gripping main story involving the continuing peril for Harry and his arch nemesis, the dark lord Voldermort (Fiennes, as sinister as possible), but what surprised me a little was seeing that there\'s even a kind of political subtext to the story at Hogwarts. This is personified by the ministry\'s new professor-cum-control freak Umbridge (Oscar nominee Imelda Staunton), who teaches theory instead of practice, and is every ultra-harsh, practically laughable disciplinarian you\'ve ever had the horror to have over your heads. Odd for some other ""kids"" movies (save for Happy Feet), but for the Harry Potter universe the foreboding presence of the ministry makes the feeling of the dread that Potter has to face that much more pronounced, as a feeling of helplessness spreads out amongst everyone in the society despite the message from the messenger that \'everything\'s fine\'. Staunton is perfect in the role of Umbridge, and helps to make the character as part of the ranks of those played by Alan Rickman (?), Gary Oldman (not really), and Ralph Fiennes (for sure) as one of the most dastardly figures in the Potter universe. Though she may even be more chilling, even as a momentary figure, because of what she represents for those who need to practice magic first hand.The sense of rebellion with the Hogwarts school is a solid facet for the Order of the Phoenix storyline, and except for a tiny sub-plot involving Harry and Cho Chang, and some of the visuals involved when the kids finally take over during a big exam (kind of like a super-magical version of the Another Brick in the Wall music video), it\'s a great balance for the much darker elements at work. There\'s another facet, aside from strong performances (Radcliffe, by the way, is really coming into his own more than ever), which is that David Yates- primarily a director of British television- imbues a lot of extraordinary imagery here. Mostly, because, he makes what could be another \'kids\' movie, as the first two films were, and makes a gradual progression from the third and fourth installments into the realm of a sort of pop-surrealism; the image of Voldermort at the train station moving his neck around could be out of a stark painting, same for the ""mystery"" room that serves for the climax of the film. It\'s much more sophisticated than one might expect, albeit some typical flashbacks used in the realm of the conceit that Voldermort screws around with Potter\'s mind a lot, and it\'s certainly the first time since \'Azkaban\' that the direction and the script are at levels of quality that one might not expect in a big summer blockbuster. There\'s nuance in this struggle of good vs evil, and it\'s worth seeing it in the theater if only on that level.And as foreboding and cryptic and always with the ominous foreshadowing- unless you\'ve read Half-Blood Prince (from which I\'ve heard, as I haven\'t read any of the books, is even *darker* than any of the others combined, with even truly disturbing imagery)- as Phoenix can get, there\'s still a sense of it being a crowd-pleaser. I liked the scenes where Hagard shows Potter and the others his half-brother, a huge ogre that marks as the least essential character story-wise but is a lot of fun to watch, and the scenes with Potter and the others in their secret training rooms gives the movie a sense of purpose for the audience to follow along. In a strange way there is some hope in Order of the Phoenix, though one needs to find it, and not in the way that the one ""we don\'t mention"" would go about it.', 'Although he was clearly acting in self-defense, neatly hair-trimmed Daniel Radcliffe (as Harry Potter) is expelled from ""Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry"" - but, he is readmitted after a trial. All along, Mr. Radcliffe insists the evil Lord Voldemort has returned from the abyss, but ""the powers that be"" don\'t believe him. It\'s looks like it\'s getting increasingly difficult giving each of the growing ""Potter"" supporting characters screen time, but it\'s still sad to see one of them die (as advertised).Smartly dressed Imelda Staunton (as Dolores Umbridge) has the plum ""new teacher"" role. Those hoping to witness Radcliffe kiss either Rupert Grint or Emma Watson shouldn\'t be too surprised when he smooches Katie Leung (as Cho Chang). None of Harry\'s younger cast has much to add, anymore. The ""Harry Potter"" storyline had peaked with the excellent ""Goblet of Fire"" (2005), and ""Order of the Phoenix"" comes across as purely calculated. Everyone is looking a little older, and a lot richer.***** Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (6/28/07) David Yates ~ Daniel Radcliffe, Imelda Staunton, Michael Gambon, Gary Oldman', ""This was my least favourite book of the series as it only really acts as a long winded build up to what happens later but happily what new director David Yates has done is to turn that original source material into a worthy addition to the film saga.This film is dark, it's funny and importantly it tells it's own complex story of Harry realising that he alone cannot fight the dark lord. From the leads to the always excellent support this film moves along at a quick pace and shows a different side to the characters we have seen grown up on screen.However it is a long film with only the last half an hour being what you would call action packed but once it all kicks off it makes for a thrilling conclusion."", ""This film is about The Order of Phoenix, that was revived to fight against the Dark Lord.I found the book really boring, tedious and full of unnecessary anger, so I was expecting a film that was similar. I am glad to report that I was wrong! The film adaptation is absolutely delightful. The pacing is right, the scenes are full of colours and magical happenings. The jokes are great, and gets the whole cinema giggling. The visual effects are stunning, especially the scene featuring moving terraced houses. I am also glad about the fact that Harry's anger is toned down a lot. Dolores Umbridge's character is so annoying, which means that her character development is excellent! Luna Lovegood is actually adorable in the film. I find this adaptation very enjoyable, and it is much better than the book!"", 'There were previous editions of the franchise that I liked. One had a real rhythm; another leveraged architecture in a truly competent way.I suppose if you are invested in the books, this one advances the story a bit: some few revelations; another battle, another death; another new character. But I am not invested in the books. I\'m invested in the cinematic adventure that comes from a film that is well made. This one isn\'t, and it cannot be blamed on the choppy nature of the source material.The effects are decidedly cheaper, and in some spots even bad. There\'s an encounter between the three ""children"" and a giant. Its handled the way it would have been in the fifties or before. Watch as the girl is picked up, then put down; see how awkwardly the camera moves so that it is never looking where you might so that it doesn\'t have to show something difficult.The effects, by the way are wildly uneven. We all know that projects like this job out scenes to dozens of subcontractors all over the planet. Each one uses a different set of tools, a different notion of how the camera behaves and frames, a different belief in the cosmology of magic and an often radically different set of artistic values. So some special effects scenes are honky bad as mentioned. Some of the better ones (there\'s a fireworks scene) belong in a different movie and surely a different world.And of course since the director is weak, the older characters played by veteran actors are incoherent. Each is left to create their own character and inhabit their own world. Can anyone believe that the characters played by Helena Bonham Carter and Emma Thompson could exist in the same dramatic world? Can anyone believe that Rickman and Gambon were ever in the same universe in terms of how they were allowed to see themselves?The director is weak because the producers are so frippin rigid and dumb that any talented director refused the offer. Rumors are that a score were approached.So far as the scenes, there were only two that I found tolerable. One was a fireworks scene. It was more cartoonish than we have seen in any Potter movie so far, but at least it was dimensional. The second is a few seconds in the final battle where thirty foot corridors of shelves collapse and the globes on those break and fall, or fall and break. Its a static shot, but well imagined. Except for those moments, you\'ll be checking your watch. There\'s no magic, and we just don\'t care about these now unattractive people.If you get your kicks from making fun at inept governments with a hint that the screwups may be motivated by conspiracy beyond stupidity -- and notions that an assistant (here white) and mouthpiece is a woman who lives in a fantasy world who explains reality away, you\'ll find that here. But not in an interesting way.Ted\'s Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.', 'Term 5 at Hogwarts for Harry and the gang and it\'s a deeply unsettling time. Harry faces getting expelled and finds himself shunned by many around him. This at a time when the Ministry of Magic compounds his misery by insisting to all and sundry that ""you know who"" is not back again.Given that JK Rowling\'s fifth book is considered to be something of a door stopper, a book more of interim Potter filler than any great amount of substance, credit has to go to new to the franchise director, David Yates. For Yates and his screenwriter Michael Goldenberg have managed to craft a briskly entertaining segment in under 2 hours and 20 minutes of film. Yes it\'s safe to say that it ultimately does feel like an interim filler movie, one that is for fans and not newcomers to the series, but the effects are superb (except Grawp that is), the action is much and suspense is not in short supply. While it also finds Radcliffe as Potter finally hitting his acting stride.New into the magical fray comes the wonderful Imelda Staunton as Dolores Umbrage, the sort of cheery psychotic teacher we all had bad dreams about in our formative years. Also most welcome is Helena Bonham Carter as nut job harpy Bellatrix Le Strange, it\'s an appetiser of substance and we can\'t wait to see some more of her from here on in. Of course the usual problem of not enough screen time for the regulars still exists, but it\'s now become a figure of grumpy acceptance in the grand scheme of Potter World. Neatly keeping the story trimmed of extraneous fat, Yates doesn\'t disappoint in delivering a last quarter as memorable as any so far in the series. Big rewards await those who wait, because the showdown that crowns Order of Phoenix is a magical mêlée of wands and wonderment; a face off between good and evil, a free for all that joyously assaults the senses.Roll on Half-Blood Prince, where it\'s great to know that Yates has been further entrusted with the Harry Potter reins. 7.5/10', 'Pretty decent movie but I think the book is better', ""Harry Potter's internal struggle with the evil Lord Voldemort is at the heart of this cerebral installment, taking a break from the overpowering action we are used to seeing(..tournament wizard contests and such)instead focusing on a potential threat towards Hogwarts school in the chuckling new professor, Dolores Umbridge(Imelda Staunton)with her wide-eyes and seemingly modest exterior harbours an aggressive desire to have full control of the school, operating by her strict standards, attempting to remove wizardry, enabling the students to practice their craft. Secretly a war is brewing between Dumbledore(Michael Gambon)and Voldemort with Harry playing a vital chess piece. It will be revealed that either Harry or Voldemort will live but both can not co-exist, a prophesy most certain to propel the next film. But, this film does follow Harry' further growth as a powerful wizard, and his nemesis particularly in this movie is Umbridge who wishes to silence the young man from even mentioning Voldemort's name. Pursuing the knowledge of casting spells which can protect them from harm, and thus enabling them to join Dumbledore's army, Hermoine(Emma Watson)and Ron(Rupert Grint)will convince Harry to train volunteers secretly behind Umbridge's back. Harry also converses with his godfather, wrongfully accused serial killer Sirius Black(Gary Oldman)who keeps him informed of the latest news regarding what Dumbledore wishes to remain hidden for his safety. We witness a very paranoid Minster of the Ministry of Magic believing that Dumbledore may be enlisting a force against him(..perhaps in part to whispers from those who might wish to see Dumbledore out as headmaster of Hogwarts)and it's visible as the newspapers increase the unease as Potter's claim of Voldemort's return has many split, some considering it bogus, others worried that he's correct.Film still features state-of-the-art special effects(..such as our introduction to Hagrid's giant half-brother and the frightening dementors working for Voldemort), but the emphasis is more towards Potter as a central figure as turmoil rages within the world of magic and wizardry. While growing into adulthood, the teenage students are forced into adult decisions as secret evils await them and the political order of things is a boiling pot where Voldemort is on the thoughts of everyone even if many would rather remain blinded/oblivious to such a horrifying truth. You get a nifty showdown between Dumbledore and Voldemort and the teen wizards even face off with Voldemort's brood who escape Azkaban. Potter's emergence as a powerful wizard whose humanity is his strength(..Voldemort considers him weak because of his emotions for those he loves)an unfolding character arc because he will be tested against the dark powers with Voldemort desiring to take control of his body. And, a very important plot-point emerges regarding Severus Snape(Alan Rickman)and why he holds such a grudge against Harry, concerning Potter's father. Once again we realize that Lucius Malfoy(Jason Isaacs)is a dangerous presence in that he's an agent for Voldemort working on the inside, an intruder who can disrupt things within the Ministry of Magic. Helena Bonham Carter returns in a small role as sorceress Bellatrix Lestrange, murdering a major supporting character who was such a guiding force in Harry's life. Above all, the importance of friendship is at the very core of this installment..Harry needs the support of his friends and allies more than ever before. There's a lot going on and it's clear that the screenplay tries to fit as much as possible from the source novel."", 'For a film that has been doing fantastic box-office business, one would hope that HARRY POTTER AND THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX would be a much more energized and fascinating movie than it is. Instead, it\'s like watching a rehash of previous Potter subplots, previous ingredients stirred into a new stew leading to a climactic confrontation with Lord Voldemort that ends in a blaze of fireworks.But the few ""big"" action scenes, while well staged with all the CGI effects bound to please the Potter fans, are hampered by a rather dull and listless storyline that has Potter looking at the dark center within himself as he plots how to avenge the dark forces trying to destroy him. And even the humor that is usually so much a part of these films is lacking, probably because EMMA WATSON and RUPERT GRINT have so little do do with the main action.But as a consolation, there are some striking performances, especially IMELDA STAUNTON as the overbearing and strict disciplinarian who injects a lot of humor into her wickedness. The film is fortunate to have her in a key role. Not much can be said for EMMA THOMPSON and MAGGIE SMITH who speak no more than a few lines, but ALAN RICKMAN and GARY OLDMAN at least have much more to do in supporting roles. Even the main villain of the piece, RALPH FIENNES as Lord Voldemort, has little actual screen time.One big ingredient the film has going for it is the background score by Nicholas Hooper which gives zest to the action scenes and the proper mood to all the dark sequences--of which there are plenty. Some of the sets are richly detailed and atmospheric, but too much of the photography takes place in the dark.Summing up: A so-so chapter in the Potter series. Hard to see why this one is proving to be such box-office gold when the story is less than satisfying.', ""I haven't read one single word of the Harry Potter saga; I did see the first film and thought it okay but not much more. On the other hand I get withdrawal symptoms if I don't see at least one movie a week and this week - the new films open here on Fridays - the pickings were pretty lean so I figured this couldn't be that bad and I was right. It's not that bad but then neither is it extra special, at least not to one who has never read the books and therefore needs help in figuring out the back story. By far the best elements for me were those satirizing the English Education system because it's quite a trick to satirize something that doesn't exist thanks to Tony Blair. On the other hand I have no doubt at all that Potter buffs will find much to enjoy and applaud here so far be it for me to rain on their parade."", 'Harry Potter and his cousin Dudley Dursley are attacked by two Dementors, but Harry manages to drive the Dementors off with a Patronus charm. Shortly thereafter, the Ministry of Magic detect the act of underage wizardry and attempt to have Harry expelled from Hogwarts immediately, but this is modified to a trial later in the summer. After experiencing horrible nightmares depicting the evil Lord Voldemort\'s return, Harry is awoken by the arrival of an advance guard of wizards who escort him to the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix, a secret organization founded by Dumbledore. It is only now that Harry discovers that under the Ministry\'s influence the newspaper The Daily Prophet has launched a smear campaign against anyone who claims that Voldemort has returned, leaving Harry feeling isolated and betrayed by the Wizarding community. Harry and the other members of the Order fly to 12 Grimmauld Place, the home of Sirius Black, where they meet with Sirius, Remus, Ron, Hermione and others. Later, Ron and Hermione express concern about Harry\'s situation with the Ministry.Harry and Arthur Weasley head to the court where Harry\'s trial will take place, briefly spotting Lucius Malfoy speaking with the minister on their way. With the help of Dumbledore and Harry\'s neighbour, Mrs Figg, Harry is cleared of all charges at the Ministry and is allowed to return to Hogwarts. However, during Harry, Ron and Hermione\'s fifth year at Hogwarts School, the Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge appoints a new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Dolores Umbridge, a Senior Ministry official who refuses to teach practical magic to her students, as the Ministry fears Dumbledore will organize his own personal wizard army. One day during class, Harry is punished for claiming that Cedric Diggory was killed by Voldemort, which according to the Ministry\'s official policy is a lie. In Umbridge\'s office, Harry is forced to write ""I must not tell lies"" repeatedly as punishment. However, the sentence is magically imprinted on his hand instead, causing scarring. Meanwhile, as Umbridge\'s control over the school increases, Ron and Hermione aid Harry in forming a secret defence group, calling themselves ""Dumbledore\'s Army"" or DA for short. Harry, Ron and Hermione start teaching at Hogwarts, training students in defensive spells to become part of the Army. Draco Malfoy and other Slytherin students are then recruited by Umbridge to try to uncover the secretive group, creating the Inquisitorial Squad. Meanwhile, Harry officially begins a relationship with Cho, as they kiss one day after training. In an attempt to tighten her oppressive grip on Hogwarts, Umbridge dismisses Professor Sybill Trelawney and tries to have her banished from Hogwarts, which is only prevented after Dumbledore\'s intervention.Harry\'s nightmares continue, including a dangerous attack upon Arthur Weasley in the Department of Mysteries involving Nagini, Lord Voldemort\'s snake, which happens to turn true. Harry\'s anger starts to get out of control, as his mental connection to Voldemort grows stronger. Fearing Voldemort will exploit his connection with Harry, Dumbledore immediately instructs Professor Snape to give Harry a crash course on Occlumency lessons in an attempt to block Harry\'s mind from the Dark Lord\'s influence.Meanwhile, Bellatrix Lestrange escapes from Azkaban along with other Death Eaters after one of the prison walls is damaged by lightning flashes. At Hogwarts, Umbridge, Filch and her loyal Inquisitorial Squad, uncover Dumbledore\'s Army after interrogating one of the students, Cho Chang for whom Harry had developed intense feelings. Dumbledore is questioned and makes an impressive escape as Fudge orders his arrest. With Dumbledore gone, Umbridge becomes the new Headmistress, and her sinister dominance over the school continues. Later, Hagrid introduces Harry, Ron and Hermione to his half-brother giant, Grawp. Later, Harry reverses Snape\'s spell by glimpsing into Snape\'s mind. It is then that Harry learns that Harry\'s father used to bully Snape when they were students at Hogwarts, which appears to be the real cause behind Snape\'s resentment towards Harry. Meanwhile the Weasley twins, Fred and George formulate a plan of their own.During an O.W.L. exam, the Weasley twins execute their plan, launching a firework display in the great hall causing chaos for Umbridge, Fudge and the students of Slytherin house. As the students cheer joyously outside, Harry suffers a vision of Sirius trapped within the bowels of the Ministry being interrogated about the Order. Harry, Ron, and Hermione rush to search for Sirius, but Umbridge, soon after, catches the trio attempting to use the Floo Network, and begins interrogating Harry. She calls for Professor Snape to bring Veritaserum for use during her interrogation, as she has for all of her previous interrogations, but Snape tells her that the supply has been exhausted. Hermione then tricks Umbridge into entering the Forbidden Forest along with Harry and her in search of a faux weapon, really leading her to the hiding place of Grawp who has since freed himself from the tree he was latched to, when a herd of centaurs, who have their own issues with the Ministry, emerge and carry the Headmistress into the darkness. Hermione and Harry head back to Hogwarts to find Ron and other DA members, Luna Lovegood, Neville Longbottom, and Ginny Weasley, the group decided to fly to London by way of the Thestrals (winged horse-like magical creatures) to the Department of Mysteries of London City in an attempt to save Sirius.The six enter the Department of Mysteries, where they uncover a prophecy involving Harry and Voldemort, but are soon ambushed by Death Eaters, including Lucius Malfoy and Bellatrix Lestrange, Sirius\'s deranged cousin. After a brief battle and a failed escape attempt, the Death Eaters, manage to take Ron, Hermione, Luna, Neville, and Ginny as hostages threatening to kill them if Harry does not hand over the prophecy. Sirius appears, with the other members of the Order of the Phoenix, and attacks the Death Eaters causing Lucius to drop the prophecy, which then shatters. A battle erupts as the Death Eaters try to stop the students from escaping, resulting in Sirius\'s death at Bellatrix\'s hand. Back in the Atrium, Harry corners Bellatrix, where he struggles with his desire to enact the Cruciatus curse. Voldemort himself appears, ready to kill Harry when Dumbledore emerges to face his battle against Voldemort.A brief but furious duel between Voldemort and Dumbledore takes place, in which Bellatrix escapes through the Floo Network. When Voldemort disappears, and the battle seems over, Harry suddenly finds himself possessed by Voldemort -- recalling images of his past, of his family and his friends but throws off Voldemort\'s influence, stating that he is stronger than Voldemort through his friends and his ability to love. Ministry officials, including Fudge, hastily arrive via the Floo Network moments before Voldemort disappears.In the aftermath of the battle, the Ministry is forced to end their smear campaign and Umbridge is removed from Hogwarts, awaiting a formal investigation. Dumbledore explains that he had attempted to distance himself from Harry all year, hoping it would lessen the risk of Voldemort discovering and using the connection between the two. While the students head home from Hogwarts at the end of the academic year, Harry tells his friends that they have one thing Voldemort does not: love, a power worth fighting for.']"
59,Wizarding World,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,417741,"[""This film has possibly the worst ending of any HP film, and wandered the furthest from the books. If you are a fan of the books, this is for you: Remember that cool battle at Hogwart's at the end of the book? It's not here. None of it.Remember the important plot setup with the tiara? Not here.Remember all the background and memories about Tom Riddle? Not here.Remember Bill Weasley? Not here.Remember Bill getting wounded by a certain werewolf? Not here.Remember Fleur?

Not here.Remember the Burrow burning down? No? Oh, because that IS here.In short, this film is great if all you took out of the book was the romance and funny bits. If you're more invested in the bigger story, you'll be disappointed."", ""As an avid Harry Potter fan who has read the books multiple times and of course seen the movies repeatedly, I was extremely excited to see this movie at the midnight showing. Half-Blood Prince is my favorite book and other than 7, the darkest book in the series.That being said, I was so disgusted with this movie. Yates & company literally turned it into Harry Potter comedy hour. I'm not sure how anyone thought this movie was amazingly dark when the theater was cracking up laughing the entire time at trite jokes. The only thing that should have been funny in this entire movie was Lavender & Won Won's obsession w/ each other.The movie emphasized the unrequited love/snogging/Ron & Lavender romance over the major plot line which was learning about Tom Riddle's background. With the exception of Dumbledore's first meeting w/ Tom & Tom asking about how to make Horcruxes, all of the background was left out. That's essentially three quarters of the book omitted.What was the point of not having Tonks find Harry on the train? How can you have Tonks call Remus sweetie and not explain all the drama between them and how they got together? How can you leave out Madam Rosmerta's involvement? What was the point of the burning of the Burrow scene? The ending was horrific. It was completely different than the book. So now Dumbledore is the only one who can apparate on Hogwarts grounds? Malfoy spends all this time working on this cabinet only to have the Death Eaters walk through, Bellatrix (who is not present in the book) encourage him to kill Dumbledore, Snape kills Dumbledore, and they kindly saunter off the grounds in no hurry. No battle... no fear of being caught...nothing. What was the point of the cabinet in the movie? It was completely anti-climatic and they didn't even have the funeral scene which is a must-have. The worst part ever was the very end...Harry and Hermione are talking about Dumbledore's death and going searching for horcruxes and she randomly chimes in that Ron is OK w/ Ginny and Harry. WHAT?! It was so awkward.And can someone please tell me how they are going to explain Dobby and Kreacher in the Deathly Hallows movies when they have essentially been omitted from the subsequent movies after being introduced? I honestly would like a do-over. They really need to re-shoot this movie and try again because it was bad. For the real fan, it leaves you cold and empty, with no tears for Dumbledore because you are so confused, and wondering why Yates and Co. cared about Lavender being funny more than the back story of Tom Riddle."", 'Oh god.This movie butchered the magic of the book. I seriously wasn\'t sure if this was the same movie... Why didn\'t Dumbledore pick Harry up from the Dursleys and give them a piece of his mind? Where was the Slug Club? Why didn\'t Harry know that Sirius\' house was now his? not to mention Kreacher? It plays a big part in the next movies! Why weren\'t the lessons with Dumbledore fully developed? You find out almost NOTHING about Voldemort\'s past. Where were Bill and Fleur? Where was the twins\' shop? (Blink and you miss it) Where was Hagrid? Where was Neville? Where was Quiditch? Where was Tonks\' and Lupin\'s relationship??? What, am I just supposed to believe that they get married out of nowhere in the next book? Where was Madam Rosmerta\'s role? Where were apparition lessons? How are the trio meant to move from place to place in the next books? Magic Carpet?!?!?! Where was Dumbledore\'s funeral? Where was Harry\'s and Ginny\'s relationship and break-up? Where was Scrimgeour? Where was the big fight at the end? Where was the set up with the diadem? Where was Fenrir Greyback? WHY for the love of all that\'s holy, did Harry just STAND there while Snape murdered Dumbledore before his very eyes? He was meant to be PETRIFIED (literally)!!! And not only that, but Snape actually SEES Harry, and does nothing about it. Won\'t Harry find it kinda odd that a Death Eater sees him, practically defenceless, and doesn\'t do anything about it? Harry is meant to believe that Snape is a full fledged Death Eater, yet he lets Harry get off scott free? That is a SERIOUS oversight in the plot of the book! All these things listed above, the major plot points, weren\'t there! I couldn\'t find them!What I COULD find however was: The burning down of the burrow...?!? Dumbledore seeming to only JUST realize that Voldemort used Horcruxes even though he was meant to have already destroyed one... and not only that but I also explicitly heard Dumbledore say: ""They could be anything""!!! In the book, he clearly points out that they WOULDN\'T be just anything, that Riddle liked collecting things. In the movie, he makes out as if it could be any old thing, a shoe, a can, a piece of paper... (better get searching then Harry, I found the ring, because ""Magic leaves traces"", but when I die, you\'re screwed!!!) Some random waitress in some random diner... A rock concert tribute to Dumbledore... A revealing of Hermione\'s love for Ron... and i DEFINITELY found Ron\'s and Lavender\'s relationship and... sexual innuendo?? OK, the Ron and Lavender subplot in the book was quite nice and funny but in the movie, it completely shadowed the ACTUAL story! they were snogging all over the place! it was impossible to focus on anything else with them popping up everywhere! It turned the movie into some sickly rom-com! and then I was shocked to find sexual innuendo! yup, believe it or not. And i know I wasn\'t the only one because i heard laughs and hoots all around the theater. The scene where Ginny bends down to tie Harry\'s shoelaces... what is up with that? Hey hang on a minute, isn\'t Harry\'s cloak meant to be a hallow? Good thing Luna CHARMED it off him then!!!MASSIVE SPOILERS AHEADSo, not only did they destroy the capodopera that this movie could have been, but they also didn\'t set up the next movie/s. How are Harry, Ron and Hermione going to start looking for the Horcruxes if they don\'t even know what they COULD be? How are the contents of Dumbledore\'s will going to be passed along if Scrimgeour doesn\'t even exist? How is Harry going to remember that Xenophilius was wearing the symbol of the Hallows at the wedding if the WEDDING CAN\'T EXIST??? And HOW is Voldemort going to get the wand from Dumbledore\'s tomb if 1. the TOMB Isn\'t THERE and 2. THE WAND Isn\'t IN THE TOMB ANYWAY!!! How is Harry meant to remember where the diadem was if he NEVER BLOODY SAW IT!!!! How are they going to use Grimmauld Place and Kreacher, not to mention Dobby if there was never even a whisper about what happened to them???This movie was thoroughly disappointing, and I really think they should... remake it basically!!! Because not only was THIS movie bad, but it\'s set to ruin the next ones as well. The only slim ray of hope (because hope springs eternal) left for the next movies is that they include what they missed out in HBP at the start of the first seventh one. They\'ve got like 5 hours for the rest of the Harry Potter story so they could fit it in.', ""I have been counting down the days since they moved this movie from its original release date. As the characters have grown older, the story line gets better, and I was hoping the same would go for the sixth movie. However, I am still completely confused about the decisions made for this movie. The movie is two and a half hours of ridiculousness. Yes, it has fantastic effects, and humor about the raging hormones, but who cares if the integrity of the story is completely diminished. Let's make a list of everything they cut out:1. The introduction of the new Minister of Magic and all that happens between him and Harry. 2. Dumbledore coming to the Dursley's house to give them a piece of his mind. 3. Harry, Ron and Hermione seeing Draco in the dress shop, and Harry getting his first idea that Draco had been branded into the Death Eaters. 4. The invisibility cloak was absent in almost every important scene besides the train. 5. Slughorn's parties (the first of which that was on the train when Ginny gets her first invite.) 6. Tonks finding Harry on the train. 7. Tonks and Lupin's relationship 8. Several key memories that help Harry find the horcruxes in the 7th book. Also the awkward arguments between Dumbledore and Harry about Dumbledore's whereabouts and what happened to his hand. 9. Hagrid and Thwarp10. Harry finding out that everything that Sirius owned now belongs to him (including the house that serves as the hiding place in the 7th book) 11. Several of the Quidditch matches and how Harry ends up in trouble and has to miss the final match. THIS is when Harry and Ginny have their first kiss when she becomes the seeker for the team and helps the team win. 12. Harry and Ginny's relationship 13.Fleur and Bill's engagement, and are completely absent in the movie. 13. Madam Rosmerta's role 14. Moaning Myrtle's role 15. THE FIGHT IN THE CASTLE!!!! ARE YOU KIDDING ME! The best part of the book and they cut it out. They deserved to be fired in my opinion. How could Rowling sign off on them doing this!? 16. Dumbledore's funeral17. Harry telling Ginny he could no longer see her...they couldn't have this scene considering they never showed them to be in a relationship.I'm sure there is a lot more, but you get the idea. All of these scenes were cut to add those that never even happened in the book. If you are an actual fan of the book, be prepared to be disappointed. If you haven't read the book, I'm sure it'll be great."", ""This segment of HP will disappoint all who read the novel. The Burrow burns down during x-mas break due to Bellatrix and Fenrir (who is never described as a werewolf) perhaps for the lack of action at the end of the movie...the Dursleys are completely cut from the movie, meaning when Dumbledore picks Harry up for the summer it's at the train station for some apparent reason...The Ginny/Dean/Harry dichotomy is skewed, there was no break up between Ginny and Dean and Harry is clearly in love with her from the start of the movie which eliminates his confusion on his feelings during the school year...Hermoine prematurely spills the beans on her feelings for Ron which was only speculation in the novels...Lavender Brown becomes a obsessive and crazed girlfriend rather than simply over-affectionate (a reminiscent Unis from She's the Man)...the battle scene is missing from the end giving Dumbledore's death an anticlimactic feel making it all the more unemotional and disappointing...Harry hides under the floor simply holding his wand looking like a coward while Dumbledore dies, Snape sees him hiding rather than Harry being frozen under his cloak compliments of Dumbledore ...There is no funeral or break up with Ginny at the end of it (there is no relationship between the two either simply a kiss)...Hagrid is basically deleted from the movie as is Neville...Pensive trips are deleted and the Horocruxes are never explained, not even slightly...Luna finds Harry on the Hogwarts Express rather than Tonks...The Slug Club simply makes a cameo rather than a proper introduction and explanation...the Inferi look more like skeletons compared to the white bodies described in the book...I'm sure more discrepancies are present, however I can only remember so many of them.It is absolutely a horrible interpretation of the book and I hope that they look at all of the mistakes and gaps left for the next movie and fill them in with more than humor (they are supposed to be in the middle of an all out war aren't they?) I mean I didn't even feel emotional when Dumbledore was killed, I was too busy trying to figure out why Harry was acting like a stunned coward under the floor boards and not doing something, isn't that his thing...doing seemingly impossible rescue missions?!?! I am utterly disappointed in this installment of HP!!"", 'SPOILERS AHEADThe beginning of the Half Blood Prince starts with the Death Eaters attacking London and destroying everything in sight. After a great opening, Harry, Ron, and Hermoine return for their sixth year at Hogwarts and then, nothing.... We get two slow hours of Ron\'s potion making, and teenage angst, with little mention of Tom Riddle\'s memories, or Harry and Dumbledore\'s hunt for his horcruxes. The Weasley\'s house is burned, and then instead of the DD funeral, they change the ending. Harry just stars under the floor, while Snape kills Dumbledore. Harry cries, and the students all wave their wands at the sky to erase the dark marks. Then Harry, Ron and Hermoine leave Hogwarts. Too many things cut out, too little action, too much fluff, and, at the end, I didn\'t care whether or not there was a DD funeral. Definitely the weakest film yet, too many things taken out, and too many silly things put back in. Too little Tom Riddle also. The movie was just plain AWFUL!If David Yates screws up Deathly Hollows half as badly as he screwed up Order of the Phoenix, and Half Blood Prince, then he will be the one to blame for taking the Potter series seriously downhill. It was the first time I have seen an audience actually fall asleep during a Harry Potter movie and after the ending, only two people clapped. There were a lot of very disappointed people after the movie ended. I have never heard the statement ""I want my money back"" from a Harry Potter movie until now. Consider me highly disappointed in that this is by far the weakest film of the series, and that\'s saying something after the extremely dull Order of the Phoenix. David Yates is bad luck for the Potter films.', ""My favorite part of the novel Harry Potter and the Halfblood Prince, which was probably my favorite novel in the series, was all of the subplots. We had the drama behind the Minister Magic and relations with the Muggle government. We had the quite humorous interactions between Dumbledore and the Dursleys. We had the whole memory of Voldemort's family - really quite crucial to the seventh book - and the memories of Voldemort finding the other Hogwarts founder items to use as Horcruxes. We had Bill and Fleur's relationship. We had Tonks's depression and patronus change, which led to Tonks and Remus's relationship. We had lots of interaction and conflict between Harry's house elves. We have Snape's constant suspicion of Harry. We have the complications with Madame Rosmerta. And we had so much in the end - Harry being trapped under the Invisibility Cloak during Dumbledore's death, an entire battle at Hogwarts, and Dumbledore's elaborate and meaningful funeral.All of that was completely and entirely omitted from the movie.What we do have is a weak plot involving an old Potions textbook that is featured about two times before Harry's friends convince him to do away with the book. Snape never punishes Harry, only reveals his identity in a brief scene at the end. The Order of the Phoenix is not mentioned at all throughout the entire movie, and neither is Grimmauld. We have a nearly sickening amount of teenage hormonal relationships - while some moments like harry comforting Hermione and Ron whispering Hermione's name in the hospital wing were well done, the growing relationship between Ginny and Harry was awkwardly portrayed. Additionally, they cut out the entire end scene - battle and all. One would think that a battle scene would attract even more moviegoers to the film, and the battle provided filmmakers a chance to show minor characters who weren't heavily featured. No, the movie ends with a weak scene showing the three main characters in a tower talking about next year. The same amount of foreshadowing could have been done within canon - Harry telling Ginny that they couldn't see each other anymore at Dumbeldore's funeral. But that certainly didn't happen.Oh, and do you remember the Burrow burning down? No? Well, it happens. It's a great scene, actually, very well done, but not remotely canon. The Burrow is integral to the plot of the seventh book. Let's see how they pull that one off.Actually, they seem to have been pretty obsessed with fire in this film. Hagrid's hut burns down as well.The cinematography, though, was excellent. One of my favorite scenes showed Harry walking up a staircase and Draco walking up a parallel staircase in the background. The lighting is effective, the various focus effects are absolutely magnificent, and the soundtrack, as always, is excellent. The film is a visual pleasure - perhaps lacking in action, but it is one of those films that one could watch several times extracting details from the masterful sets."", 'Last night I had gone to the midnight showing of the movie. This morning I wrote a review (below) b/c I wanted to express how disappointed I was. However, I still had tickets to go see it this afternoon. I certainly did not want to sit there for another 2 hours hating it so I had to find a way to like it. I really, really wanted to like this movie. I love HP, afterall! I decided to try another approach, to watch the movie without thinking of the book at all. And I\'ll be da*ned if it didn\'t work! I realized that I had spent so much time picking apart what the movie DID NOT have, that I never allowed myself to enjoy what it DID have. Once I did that, and accepted that this movie is merely ""based on"" the book, I was able to enjoy it! Suddenly, the love story did not seem to dominate as much as it did on my first viewing.....Honestly, I never really thought that changing the way I approached the movie would work, but it did. So, if your a really big fan of the books and cd\'s, and you really want to find some way to enjoy this movie, I suggest you leave all the knowledge you have of the books at home, sit back, and watch! I started reading reviews last week, so I was aware that all the really good stuff in the book wasn\'t going to be in the movie. Still I was excited and stood in line for almost 3 hours to see this movie. When I left I felt very, very disappointed. I couldn\'t believe what I watched, this was a joke, right? Sure that other Harry Potter fans felt the same way, I started to read the fan reviews. Now I\'m wondering....did I miss something? How is it this movie is getting such rave reviews?? Did anyone not notice all the plot moments that were changed or left out completely? SPOILERS************************************************ I so wanted to see Dumbledore give the Dursley\'s their due. And how about Harry and Dumbldore going on the journey to view the Marvolos and Voldomorts father? And lets not even talk about the best part of the book, the fight at the castle. I read somewhere that the director did not want to do the fight because of the fight in book 7. I mean really, come on, that\'s probably the lamest excuse I\'ve ever heard. Ya know, I never even shed a bloody tear when they killed Dumbledore. There was no emotional work up to it, in my opinion, it was really weak. When I read the book, I cried for days! Well, maybe that\'s why I did not during the movie....I already mourned him :-) I knew their had to be a lot of things that did not make it in the movie, I just assumed it would be the teenage love angst. Especially given the action films this movie is competing against.But then again, it\'s getting great reviews, so I think I\'m part of the minority of people who were really, really hoping to get a Harry Potter movie that would make JK Rowling proud, at least when she cared.The movie was funny, absolutely. But that\'s all it was, except for the last 30 minutes. The last 30 minutes, like the 5th movie, is the best part, IMO. But, that\'s not saying much.', ""The reason I gave this an 8 is because it is truly a sensational film, the best yet out of the whole franchise. The acting is milestones ahead of what it has been in previous HP films (especially from Emma Watson), the storyline and characters are much more layered and 3D, the sets and special effects are breathtaking, and the score is absolutely gorgeous. As a stand-alone film, I would happily give this a 10.BUT, of course, it is not a stand-alone film - it is the follow up of many other films, and is also based on a book so rich and layered that it could not possibly compete. While this is (IMO) the best film so far, it is also the most unlike the book, and if you know the book and what follows in the Deathly Hallows, you can't help but notice gaping holes in the plot where crucial information has been left out. This film features only 2 of Dumbledore's collected memories - the book shows quite a few more, some of which are important in Harry's hunt for the horcruxes and may have to be dumped somewhere unfitting in the next two films, just to get them out the way (for example, the memory featuring Hepsibar Smith and Hufflepuff's cup). Also, fans of the book will no doubt notice that some of their favourite scenes have been taken out: the funeral at the end, the aftermath of the final Quidditch match (the involvement of Quidditch in this film was entertaining, but seemed pointless as it lead to nothing), and most importantly the battle at Hogwarts between the Death Eaters and The Order/Dumbledore's Army. What I'm trying to say is, if you have not read the book you will probably be able to enjoy this film for the beautiful and intense piece of work it really is - but unfortunately, if you have read the book then the comparisons will come flying at you from the very start, whether you like it or not, and there are definitely more here than there have been in previous instalments.Half-Blood Prince is definitely the darkest of the books, and this has proved to be the darkest film - the ever present sense of tension or even impending doom is hair-raising, and every scene featuring Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy) had me almost breathless, even if he does look about 30 now. He is definitely one of the best actors of the HP films. There are also some painfully tear jerking moments throughout: including a surprise attack on the Burrow, which was heartbreaking, and the scene in the cave where Harry has to force the liquid down Dumbledore's throat - that is the first time, in any film since he started, that I've really appreciated Michael Gambon as Dumbledore, which I imagine will be the same for many of you.In short, definitely a must see - but book fans must accept that the films have taken their own turn now, and I imagine that the changes in this one will lead to some very major differences in the two Deathly Hallows instalments. The films could never be the masterpieces that the books are, but this one sure comes close....mischief managed."", ""As an avid reader of the HP book series, and a devout HP movie fan, the sixth installment came up short in almost every aspect of the film.From a purely cinematographic point of view, the dialogue was rushed, the almost non-existent plot focused too much on minor relationships and details, and none of the scenes elicited the response intended. It was difficult for a scene to last one minute, let alone thirty seconds. The climax was not given enough time to fully develop, and the story ended so abruptly even I was left with a sense of confusion. I cannot imagine how anyone who has not read the books could have followed the plot line at all.When viewing the film with the book fresh in mind, the movie fell so far below expectations it is the greatest disappointment movie-wise to date. The team managed to take a complex, intricate, well-written novel and turn it into a fast-pasted, over-hormonal, and unemotional movie. When I think of the Half Blood Prince, I think of the main purpose to be getting horcruxes, not getting laid. When I initially heard about the fake scene at the Burrow I had an open mind, and figured it would play into the plot. After viewing however, I can only see it as a waste of time, because the only character it introduced was Greyback, but you never heard of him again through the entire movie until the very end--in which he did nothing.The fact that the battle at Hogwarts was left out gives the whole movie an anti-climatic feel. The movie barely even hits on Voldemort's past or what horcruxes are, and the cave scene was dry and unemotional. Dumbledore's death and Snape's betrayal did not elicit any response from me or any of my peers that saw the movie with me. At the end of the movie the audience should be lamenting Dumbledore's horrific death, but the movie moved so fast it was hard to truly wrap your mind around one scene before another began.All in all I found this movie horribly disappointing. The only actor who I saw any significant improvement in was Emma Watson, everyone else seemed cold and unattached. I sincerely hope the seventh movie will be better."", ""Darker than ever, Lord Voldemort has been revealed in the 'Order of the Phoenix'. The forces of darkness are gathering strength. Fear has spread throughout the wizard world. Harry Potter is now investigating Voldemort's plans through his old teacher Professor Horace Slughorn (Jim Broadbent).Director David Yates returns and will for the remainder of the series. It has a more serious tone. The teenage love drama is heating up especially for Hermione and Ron. It comes to a head in this one in a satisfying melodrama.The reveal of Voldemort's plan is a bit confusing. More effort is needed to explain what a Horcrux is. A scene with Voldemort creating one of the Hocrux would solve the problem. For the big death climax, the action is rather lacking. It needs more drama. I'm reminded of 'Empire Strikes Back'. In that movie, the big scene gets the most iconic treatment. Something like that is needed here. But it still works while following the book. That's probably more important."", 'HP6 is a dark and emotionally thrilling masterpiece. It combines magical awes that appeal mostly to children as well as mature and dark themes that appeal to almost everyone. It discovers the dark and mysterious past of you-know-who and leaves the audience aching for more as its two and half hours run time go by in a flash. The film contains dazzling visuals and terrific cinematography. It is indeed a satisfying experience that will please just about everyone. One thing is for certain though: in resemblance to the Rowling novels, the film series seems to get darker and more mature with every passing film while keeping an incredible PG rating (in the exception of HP4 & 5). This film not only has some bangs and booms but also explores the theme of teenage love as the three protagonists find themselves tangled in teenage romances. Overall a top notch film worth seeing over and over. Cant wait for the arrival of the Deathly Hallows.', ""I consider myself a Harry Potter fan. Not of the movies, but from the books which they came from. There's a reason why each of J.K. Rowling's 7 books have brought much fan base all over the world, it's because of the magic of the Harry Potter books.In the last several years, I feel more and more magic from the books have been cut from the movies. I blame this on Warner Brothers who obviously views the Potter property as a ticket to high profit rather than an experience that filmgoers and book lovers can share together.I loved the essence of the first two films, but when Alfonso Cuaron took over as the director of Prisoner of Azkaban, it seems more and more material had been cut from the books on which they are based. Prisoner of Azkaban was the first and some key sequences were eliminated. The change wasn't too bad -- back then. Then Goblet of Fire came out a year later, and even more material was cut. Then Order of the Phoenix came out two years ago, and it seems half of the book was cut to the point where the film was quite dull and pointless.But, Half Blood Prince is the worst of them all. Many fans of the Harry Potter film series keep on stating that the films are an entirely different form of entertainment than the books, and that all the details cannot be included. That's nonsense. The first two Harry Potter movies were able to capture the essence of the books perfectly. The Narnia films were able to capture the essence of their books perfectly as well, there is no reason why the rest of the Harry Potter books cannot do the same.What we have with Half Blood Prince is a cliff note's version of the film with much of the material that made the book so special completely cut out. Events such as Harry and Dumbledore's quest for Voldemort's Horcruxes are barely touched on, while the majority of the film focuses on the sillier parts of the novel such as the growing hormones between the sixth year Hogwarts students. It seems that the producers of Harry Potter were aware of the growing popularity of the Twilight phenomenon and wanted to make their own teenage romantic love story as part of the series. That doesn't feel right in a Harry Potter film in anyway.I feel that David Yates directed the two worst Harry Potter films so far, and that he will undoubtedly destroy the once great Harry Potter film series. The fact that the final book will be split into two separate films makes me question his abilities as a director of the final film of one of the best fantasy book series of all time."", ""I was lucky enough to see a preview of Half-Blood Prince three days before opening day. I saw it a second time with my son who is not quite ten, but who is generally mature for his age and doesn't scare easily. The two viewings give me the unique advantage of both the adult and the child perspective on the movie. I only recently started counting myself a true Harry Potter fan after my son introduced me to the movies a couple of years ago. I finished the last book only three weeks before seeing the movie adaptation of Half-Blood Prince the first time.With all the book details very fresh in my mind, I had high expectations of the movie. And Yates, the production crew and the cast definitely delivered. The movie impresses on many levels from an artistic point of view. The stripped landscapes and washed out colors convey a constant feeling of dread and foreboding. The standard train trip to Hogwarts was particularly stark, seen against a landscape scorched by a hot summer sun and dotted with dark pools of water. The usual lush greenery and joyous train ride are nowhere to be seen.Personally, I felt the pace was spot-on and that the movie elegantly made time for all key plot points. But only if you enjoy a plot line driven by character and emotion. For the younger lot, looking for frightening wizard duels and attacks by magical creatures, the first hour and a half of the movie drags on a bit. My son certainly became fidgety, and didn't appreciate the finesse and sophistication of the plot and cinematic approach.Most of the threatening and darkening tone of the movie was also lost upon him, whereas I reveled in the finer details contributing to a general sense of ever-encroaching darkness. There are worse things in life to be afraid of than big hairy spiders. My son missed seeing those - I was a lot more intrigued by the ominous undercurrents made palpable by the indomitable trio of David Yates (director), Steve Kloves (screenplay) and Delbonnel (photography).Some people feel that the romantic comedy aspects played too large a role in the movie, but I felt this aspect added some much-needed lightness and human drama to the movie. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint) all find themselves dealing with the vagaries of young love - from dealing with unwanted advances to finding love in unexpected places. The romance was aimed perfectly at the young teen market, and I found myself cringing ruefully at some of Lavender Brown's love-obsessed stunts and smiling wistfully at the tenderness between Harry and Ginny. Haven't we all been there at some stage of our lives?All in all, Harry Potter is growing up. And so is the market for these movies. If you've seen all the movies up to now or read all the books, and your are at an age to appreciate the adult themes and movie techniques, this movie should fall pitch-perfect on your ear. You are likely to leave the cinema filled with a heart-wrenching sadness for innocence lost. Purist fans will most certainly complain bitterly about numerous sub-plots, events and characters that were cut from the movie and the odd scene that doesn't exist in the book. But Yates' truly gutsy adaptation really works and brings a depth and clarity to the main themes of the book that is quite extraordinary. He manages to capture the lingering lightness of that time before the serious business of adulthood sets in, alongside the relentless buildup to the final showdown between The Dark Lord and The Chosen One. And the lack of closure at the end of the movie is no accident, I believe. Just like the book, this movie leaves you aching to see how it all ends (never mind the fact that you already know).I must also commend the acting. The young leads have all matured in pace with the maturing content of the books and their acting shows it. Rupert Grint shines brightly in the somewhat Shakespearean love comedy he finds himself in, and makes the most of his new-found sport hero popularity. Emma Watson hits the spot, portraying Hermione's emotional vulnerability with gentle confidence and softness.As for Radcliffe, it's easy to miss the evolution he's undergone as Harry, since there are other actors ostensibly given more to do in this outing, like Tom Felton and Bonnie Wright, both of whom get the opportunity to take their characters to a new level. Tom Felton, especially, does a remarkable job. But Radcliffe's task of playing the steadfast and courageous, yet not flashy or arrogant hero, remains a difficult one. Especially on second viewing, it becomes clear how his understated and controlled performance speaks very much to the type of man Harry Potter is shaping up to be. A man who is left with a tremendous responsibility at the end of this movie and takes it up without flinching. The boy-wizard is no more.Of the older guard, Alan Rickman's Snape was a consummate performance, ... obviously. And Michael Gambon's portrayal of Dumbledore never felt more right than in this movie. Jim Broadbent's Slughorn is deliciously played with just the right mix of off-putting sycophancy and endearing pathos.All in all - a triumph all around!"", ""I'll keep this short and bittersweet. While not without its merits, the sixth film in the HP series was very much a let-down for me.First of all, I'm a die-hard fan of the books, but I absolutely didn't want or expect the movie to follow the book page-for-page. In fact, some of the creative liberty taken in the film was quite good. One scene in particular was very good, where Bellatrix and Fenrir Greyback attack the burrow, leading to a showdown in the marsh between Harry, Ginny and the two Death Eaters. Or at least it had the potential to be very good. In fact, much of the movie was very anticlimactic. That scene, among many other crucial scenes, fizzles out when nothing happens. There is a short duel, and then the DE's leave. The same thing happens in the end of the movie, which was the biggest let-down of all the films so far. The battle through Hogwarts at the end of the book was the big climax, leading up to Dumbledore's death. In the film, the whole battle is cut out, replaced instead by a very short and mawkish scene in which Snape gives a quick Avada Kedavra, and then everyone goes on their way.In short, the lack of appropriate emotional content and the lack of any real climax anywhere throughout the film just makes the whole thing a bit lackluster. Bringing David Yates back into the picture was clearly a costly mistake."", 'It\'s a real shame that I could never give a film featuring Harry Potter the status of a perfect film. Each tale relies so heavily on those that came before or after that one can never be a truly all-encompassing work. Sure, the three-act structure can be utilized, but without the background info, nor the knowledge that more will be coming, watching a middle installment alone will leave you confused and disorientated. The reason I bring this up is the fact that Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is good enough to warrant the praise and to put the idea in my head about whether to call it a masterpiece. The tone is perfect, the laughs are many, the darkness is charcoal black—how could this be the same director as the abysmal—in comparison to the rest of the series—Order of the Phoenix, David Yates? Two words \x85 Bruno Delbonnel.Who is Delbonnel you may ask? Well, he is the brilliant cinematographer behind the camera. I may have blamed the failures of the fifth film on its screenplay as Steve Kloves was glaringly absent, (he being the writer of each other film, including this new one), but a film is a team effort. Therefore I guess maybe I shouldn\'t put all the accolades on one man now; I just feel absolutely compelled to do so because so many moments linger in my mind due to the beauty of their composition and use of their environments to stay interesting and exciting at all times. Visually, you cannot be bored. It just goes to show that it is never the director alone, but also the team he or she brings along. I like Yates and was surprised at how much I disliked his first foray in the Potter universe, granted, I felt the book itself was sub-par at best. Thankfully, he did not disappoint with his second of three, (make that four as book seven goes to a two-part finale), because, as it was with the novels, Half-Blood Prince is by far the best of the series—until Deathly Hallows of course. And adding the pedigree of a guy like Delbonnel, with films such as Across the Universe, A Very Long Engagement, and Amelie in his back pocket—all stunning works of art—only makes his job easier.I can\'t get over the use of close-ups throughout, or the multiple instances of framing used to hide something on screen. Oftentimes, the camera pans or cuts to reveal something in the fringes, to highlight the focal point when it\'s not centrally located, or literally move our eyes to exactly where the filmmakers want them to be. The blocking is superb with some scenes blurring the edges and keeping only our main object of interest in focus, timing and positioning executed with aplomb. And did I mention the close-ups? (Yes, I know I did.) One sequence, with Harry and Ginny running through a field of tall grass after intruding Death Eaters, is shot with a high speed pan to keep the characters crisp as the foliage darts and blurs in their wake. I\'d be remiss not to mention the special effects as well, especially when dealing with the black smoke trails from Voldemort\'s flying goons as well as the wispy pensieve. Whether completely computer generated or practical dye clouds in water, the effect is pitch perfect, even dissolving each memory in sections, leaving important pieces, like young Tom Riddle, to be lingered on just a second longer than the rest.As for the leads, Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson are solid as usual, (Radcliffe showing some solid comedic chops after taking luck elixir), and Rupert Grint\'s Ron Weasley gets some room to break free. But it is the supporting roles that deserve notice. Helena Bonham Carter will scare children, so kudos to her, and Michael Gambon\'s Dumbledore will win even more hearts as his leader finally allows Potter into the inner circle of the plan to rid the world of Voldemort, it now being a circle of two. It is newcomer Jim Broadbent, however, as Professor Slughorn who steals the show. Broadbent is known for his many comical expressions and his rubber face is utilized to great effect here. A blowhard and man with many ""friends"", his jubilant smile and need to collect powerful and famous wizards for his Slug Club are ever-present, bringing some levity as well as effectively hiding the dark secret that lies beneath.Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince succeeds in the details. It is an exercise in minimalism and showing only what is necessary to the plot. Condensing the novel better than ever done before, Kloves has given Yates the tools to make a film and not just a visual representation of the words. What had previously been done best by Azkaban\'s Alfonso Cuaron, this one works better at retaining more subplots and not stripping it quite so bare. Subtle hints are planted so no longwinded exposition is needed to make us, as an audience, feel stupid and lectured to. Instead Yates and crew allow us to show our intelligence and ability to use our eyes and memories to piece things together, making the experience more enjoyable as we believe we are solving the mysteries and not the director who is skillfully guiding us through. I\'d say it couldn\'t get better than this, but my confidence in Yates has been renewed and my hopes that Deathly Hallows is treated with respect is at one hundred percent, so who knows what the future has to offer?', 'Let me say this. Half Blood Prince as a movie alone was very good. It stands it\'s ground as a film better than any of the others of the series. But only as a film. And only because there are so many parts to a film. This installment obviously stepped everything up a notch: the cinematography, the special effects, the darker score, the improved acting, etc... But the key element which was boosted this franchise into world-class fame, is the story. And in this one, it\'s just not there. As a fan of the books and having had no SERIOUS gripes with any of the other films, I must say i HATED the screenplay for this one. Everything that made the book amazing was ripped from the film, and instead replaced by annoying large quantities of romantic subplot. Yes, there is romance in the sixth book but not shoved down your throat. JK Rowling masterfully crafted a novel that was perfectly balanced. The romance was there although it didn\'t detract from the main plot and at times was intertwined with the larger goings-on at hogwarts. In the movie the romance takes up most of the screen time. Not to mention the ending of the film was brutally butchered.So much time could have been detracted from the silly romances to focus on more important things which were completely ommitted or deliberately changed. The ending is extremely anti-climactic and once it\'s over it\'ll leave you in your seat thinking ""it\'s over?""My final gripe with this movie is that it really should have been PG-13. If you\'ve read the novel then you know the subject matter is MUCH darker and the story would have been done greater justice with just a higher rating(and a better screenwriter, yes i\'m looking at you Steve Kloves).Overall as a movie i\'d give it an 8 out of 10.But as a HARRY POTTER movie it gets 4 out of 10. And that\'s pushing it.Well heres to 2010 to see how they screw up the finale. Oh wait, they already did. I didn\'t know there were 8 years at hogwarts...', 'Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince was horrible. Don\'t get me wrong: The acting was great, the score was amazing, the scenery beautiful... The only thing wrong? The plot. They absolutely BUTCHERED the book--and while I (and millions of others) agree that YES, they cannot fit everything from the book into the movie, I (also like many others) do say that there were some HUGE plot points that they skipped and they took trivial, two-sentence moments from the book and made THOSE into the main parts of the movie. Oh, and let\'s not forget how much they added! But I\'ll just list it out for you:1. Does anyone remember the Burrow burning down in the book? No? Oh, that\'s right--it doesn\'t. But in the movie it does! Don\'t ask why--no one knows. 2. They never really mentioned that Fenrir Greyback was a werewolf. He just looked like a yellow-eyed, exceptionally hairy man. 3. They never/barely mentioned or showed Bill and Fleur--and they didn\'t mention the wedding. So I don\'t know they\'re going to start the 7th movie--with a random wedding? Non-book readers, get ready for some surprises! 4. Where was Hagrid? And Neville? They both only had, like, 2 scenes each and they resorted Neville back to the fumbling loser he was before, when he SHOULD have been becoming more of a take-charge kind of guy, like he was in the Hallows. 5. Where was ANYONE, for that matter? All of those characters we know and love (and sometimes love to hate) weren\'t there! Or if they were, they had really minor scenes! McGonagall and Parvati and Flitwick and LUNA and people like them. 6. Where were all the memories? The Horcrux discussions? The evening lessons? Everyone heard Dumbledore clearly say (of the Horcruxes), ""They could be anything."" Riiight--wasn\'t Dumbledore supposed to have an inkling of what they might be? What is Harry supposed to do now, guess all of them?7. And what was up with Dumbledore JUST finding out that Voldemort was using Horcruxes? That is wrong/weird for two reasons: A) Dumbledore is supposed to have all the answers, so that was weird and B) He had already acquired the ring and destroyed it--if he didn\'t know Voldemort was using Horcruxes, why? Did he just feel like smashing it?8. There was no battle at the end. The Death Eaters kind of just waltzed in, trashed some things and then killed Dumbledore (while Harry cowered in fear, by the way, which is so wrong). Then they left, after smashing some windows. And all this happened while everyone was asleep, I might add.9. Oh, and then, Hagrid took Dumbledore\'s body outside and somehow, everyone was randomly outside, staring at his body and not even crying or looking sad...? 10. There was no funeral. Okay... so what did they do to Dumbledore\'s body? Threw it in a sack, I guess. 11. And the Flight of the Prince was so lame. It wasn\'t dramatic at all, Harry\'s and Snape\'s expressions were so wooden I thought they were trees, and it was all over in about three seconds. 12. Harry and Ginny\'s get-together and break-up... neither was there. One day Ginny was with Dean, the next she was with Harry. And then at the end... they were still together. Okay, then. And they never showed Harry awkwardly realizing he liked Ginny. I mean, why show THAT when you could show Ron and Lavender thrashing about all the time, right...?13. And then Hermione blurted out her love for Ron. Great and all--but what are they going to do for the Hallows now?14. And all the random, awkward, unexplained moments. Like: Ginny tying Harry\'s shoelaces, or Hermione blurting out--almost right after Dumbledore died--""Oh, Harry, by the way: Ron is okay with you dating Ginny."" Um... what? So, basically, the movie was more like a 99 percent Ron-and-Lavender- and-Hermione love triangle than a Harry-and-Ginny or a Harry-and- Dumbledore-and-memories sort of thing. Wonderful! And yes, I am a die- hard fan (have read each book about 200 times--not kidding) but I am NOT biased. Order of the Phoenix pretty much... sucked, but I let it go, and enjoyed it, \'cause at least it had SOME of the main parts! Like the fight at the end, right? But this? Let\'s just put it like this: if I had a magic wand, I wouldn\'t use it to do magic--I\'d use it to stab myself in the eyes. Cheerio, Ginny (and that\'s really my name)', 'Since I consider myself a dedicated Harry Potter fan, I am going to try to put this as nicely as possible...If I had never read any of the books (hey they\'re long I get it) I would have thought this movie was pretty cool and a step up from past films in terms of laughter and the script itself including special effects. There would have been mild confusion towards the end but as said before I would be the casual fan who wouldn\'t really mind.That being said, I am not what you would call a ""casual fan."" I along with many others had been devastated when I learned that Warner Brothers had pushed back the release date 6 months and had waited in the theatre for 3+ hours for a movie that I was anticipating to be one of my favorites in the series. In its good moments, there were little things from the book which I was happy to see on the silver screen. Ron\'s sudden girl-magnet status was done very well along with Slughorn\'s character debut. The only thing that was wrong was the title. I thought this was Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince? I did not buy a ticket to Ronald Weasley and the stories of Romance nor did I buy a ticket to Harry Potter\'s Friends with a touch of You-Know-Who on the side. Not only that, what happened to the plot? Where did it go? Who knows...maybe Ron will know if we ask him....How can you fear a wizard when you can\'t understand why he is the way that he is? What happened to that kiss between Harry and Ginny? (YIKES...oh ""i can stay hidden in here too""...WHAT????)Where was Snape\'s big moment? Where was the drama? In addition, why oh why\x85would you omit critical moments and downgrade important characters to CREATE new ones that don\'t mean anything to take their place? Bottom line: This movie was like part 1 of 3 with no real closure, action, and not to mention storyline\x85. Lets all keep our fingers crossed that 7 and 8 live up to what the books and their fans deserve', ""Let me start by saying, I know that you have to alter and omit scenes from a novel when adapting it to the silver screen. However, it is not necessary to take a chain saw to what can easily be debated as the best book in the series. Half-Blood Prince is key to setting up the final, now two, movies and this version missed the mark. Now the major novel plot points are there, Harry learns about Voldemort's past, Draco struggles with his chosen task and Snape does kill Dumbledore but much of the set-up plot and subplots have been completely omitted. For fans out there that have read the book will get a strange feeling in their gut just a few minutes in.After the Deatheater attack on London the muggel minister is supposed to receive a late night visit. Omitted! During the time spent at the Wesley's prior to the school year there is supposed to be a blast from the past and news of an upcoming marriage. Omitted! So just minutes into the feature many of the actual fans should start to wonder if something fishy is going on. After the duration of the film all of the omissions are topped off by the big daddy of them all. There is no funeral for the deceased headmaster. How can that be? it is easily the 2nd biggest moment in seven novels, next to the climax when Voldemort is killed. Additional ommisions: Many of Dumbeldore's Voldemort memories Any of Snape's interaction as the Defense against the Dark Arts instructorProper development of the Snape Good Vs. Evil plot Quitich cup match, unless that is the match shown in the movie but you couldn't tell The alterations in the film are also a huge let down. Unfortunately our friendly writers decided that it would be wise to alter the first kiss of the future Mr. and Mrs. Potter. I cannot even wrap my head around why writers would think fans wouldn't notice. I'm not even going to get into, beyond a mention, of the two biggest changes. When the headmaster gets killed it needs to be word for word from the novel, enough said. Since they felt it necessary to not shoot the funeral I guess they felt it would be fine to end with our three heroes together instead of Harry walking off after breaking up with Ginny. Those are Huge! Now before I continue to rag on the choices of the writers I will say that HBP is visually stunning to a level above the previous films and what they did put into the script works for the film. Only those who have spent the time to read the novel will notice the major issues with this film. For entertainment value alone it was a good movie. Please to not destroy Deathly Hallows the way this edition was destroyed."", ""This movie focuses on the relationships too much and not the actual story. There was more of Tom Riddle's backstory in the book and in the film, they could've focused on that instead of the relationships"", 'If you don\'t know the book (like me), but watched the trailer before you watched the movie, you could be excused for feeling a bit cheated. The trailer actually promises something that doesn\'t really happen (real world). But try to free your mind of that. I was a bit confused, but it didn\'t really throw me off the movie.Of course, it goes without saying that you should watch the other Harry Potter movies before you watch this. While there is pretty light humor to be found here (and some love stories), it all gets spiced up, by some really dark undertones and some things that happen. I wouldn\'t say that Harry Potter is getting into an adult phase, but he definitely gets wiser with every movie. Which can\'t be said, for all his friends. But then again, some are there for comedic relieve, which is pretty obvious. And not a bad thing at all. The effects are great (not that you should have expected less) and the story moves along ""fast"" (the running time doesn\'t seem to be a problem or a drag). Of course some might say that he is still too childish (or the whole feeling is childish), but that would be beside the point. The movie does not hide what it\'s intentions are ...', ""If you love the series like I do you will know that in every movie they have to cut parts of the book out. Most of the time they manage it without compromising the integrity of the film. This time they fall very short of the mark. For those that have not read the book this movie will impress. The effects are top notch and it is a very engrossing film. I understand the need to cut the movie in order to fit it into a realistic time frame. In doing so, it seems as if they cut key parts in order to allow for more comedy. They also cut out a large action scene at the end of the movie. This scene could have been added if not for the adding of a scene in the middle that was not part of the original book. Furthermore, the scene makes no sense because during which they destroy something that is key to the book in the seventh volume. Not only do they cut scenes, but they change others to suit what purpose you might ask? The unfortunate answer is I don't know. Another minor point that I noticed during the movie is, although there is not as much violence as previous movies the overall film includes adult content that in my opinion warrants the pg-13 rating.Do not misunderstand me. I recommend seeing the movie as it is enjoyable, but trying to change a masterpiece like J.K. Rowling's book is a mistake and I think this movie suffered from it. If I didn't have the book to reference I would've rated this movie an 8, but the simple fact is I do and it unfortunately falls short."", 'Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince - A footnote: Funny thing about Harry Potter reviews. If you peruse enough of them, you\'ll notice that ""lack of nit-picks"" is a substitute for praise. Everyone comes from different points of view when they go in to see these films. Some people read the books, some haven\'t. Everyone has their favorites, or hates the films in general. I have never experienced the films without having read the books first so I cannot comment on how hard it is to follow any of them. For some they are too long, for some not enough. I have enjoyed all of the films to varying degrees all for different reasons. David Yates continues from where he left Order of the Phoenix, arguably the weakest of the seven books but one of the stronger films.In the sixth Harry Potter, Harry works with Dumbledore to unlock a key secret about Voldemort. To do this, Harry has to get close to Professor Slughorn (played with aplomb by Jim Broadbent). What interested me most about the way this is played out are the quiet similarities presented between Harry and Tom Riddle. Dumbledore actively wants Harry to act more like Tom in an attempt to defeat him. This enhances the idea posited back in the 2nd film and book. The sub-plots surrounding this are delightful. Quidditch has never been done so well. The Slug Party is also delightful. Harry\'s fancying Ginny and Ron\'s troubles between Lavender and Hermione round out the film. A small downside of this is there is less room for some of the best talent in the UK, many of whom merely supply the garnish on a good meal.Michael Gambon is wonderful in this turn as the greatest wizard Dumbledore. He just needed the screen time to shine. I hope this nails the lid on the doubters. Alan Rickman plays Snape to perfection, much as it would have been fun to see him momentarily lose his cool. Maggie Smith and Robbie Coltrane have wonderful cameos. I seem to be the only person that appreciates Daniel Radcliffe post-Equus. I think the young man has really come into his own. Rupert Grint has also become a fine comedic actor. Tom Felton slowly freaks the hell out as a young man given an impossible task. My favorite little scene stealer is Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood.The film plays fast and loose with the source material, and, unlike with Prisoner of Azkaban, the results are not disappointing. On the contrary, this might be, next to Goblet of Fire, my favorite of the films. Part of the reason this time is the film\'s atmosphere is so appropriate, the characters so well acted and written, that it makes us yearn for more of everything that IS in the film, not lament what was cast aside. I can forgive plot simplification as film is a different medium. I would not have made all the choices Yates has, but he nails the beginning and end of the film, includes many touching character moments, and the movie on the whole is FUNNY damnit! True Potter fans should see that Yates has broken the letter to preserve the spirit of Harry Potter.One note from the Potter die-hard within the competent film critic: it is disappointing to miss out on one crucial flashback that would have given Ralph Fiennes a terribly awesome scene to do with Michael Gambon. As for the rest. Potter-ites, Yates has this well in hand. Put aside the canon-charts, and enjoy watching small variations on a story you know and love. I know, given the choice, I prefer a story that pops to life over one nailed down to a strict regiment of plot points and exposition. A-', 'I think people are forgetting that the book is a very complicated one to transcribe to screen, but the film, bearing in mind that it changed the overall structure of the book, missed some very dramatic scenes out, and characters like Rufus Scrimgeur and Rosmerta were left out entirely is definitely the best of the Harry Potter films. The climax was good, but compared to the book\'s climax, which was much more intense, I felt it could have had more action, and perhaps more explanation. Visually, it is a marvel to look at, especially with the Cave Scene with the dark brooding cinematography and the splendid special effects. But somehow Steve Kloves managed to not only make some genuine scares, namely when the arm of one of those grey creatures comes out the water and grabs Harry, (this made me jump violently) but there were some really funny bits. Like when a student is sick in front of Snape, Snape says ""you have just earned yourself a month\'s worth of detentions"", and Ron and Lavender\'s romance. My favourite has to be Harry and Ron\'s hilarious conversation about girls\' skin, and when Dumbledore is seen holding a Woman\'s Own magazine! Not to mention, Luna\'s dress in one scene, what was she wearing? I am just wondering though, whether I was the only one who wept buckets at the end, sorry, seeing Harry crying over Dumbledore\'s body and everyone staring on helplessly, just started me off on an emotional drainage. Back to the film, the music was beautiful and very haunting as well as noticeably darker in tone to the scores by John Williams and Patrick Doyle, and there was some splendid looking scenery. The acting was excellent, Daniel Radcliffe is likable as Harry, Rupert Grint hilarious as Ron and Emma Watson giving her best performance as the character. Robbie Coltrane was good, but it is a shame he didn\'t get that much screen time. I never cared much for Michael Gambon as Dumbledore, Richard Harris was more my idea of the character, but Gambon like Watson gives his best performance (as the character that is). Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith were solid as rocks in their roles as Snape and McGonagall, and Tom Felton was remarkably good as Malfoy. Helena Bonham Carter was brilliant as Bellatrix, nobody could play her better. But for me, the scene stealer was Jim Broadbent as Slughorn, maybe not what Rowling intended in terms of figure, but the the performance is wonderfully electric. The direction was competent, overall, the film is no masterpiece, but it is the best of the series, so I thoroughly recommend it. 9/10 Bethany Cox.', 'Scarred by his experience at the Ministry of Magic with Voldemort, Harry is reluctant to return to Hogwarts. Dumbledore encourages him to continue, after transporting him to see a former professor, Horace Slughorn, hoping that Slughorn would return to Hogwarts and take Harry under his wing.Meanwhile, Death Eaters begin to wreak havoc both towards Muggles, destroying the Millennium Bridge, and Wizards, kidnapping the wandmaker Mr. Ollivander and destroying his Diagon Alley shop. Bellatrix Lestrange entreats Severus Snape to enter an Unbreakable Vow with Draco Malfoy\'s mother, Narcissa, assuring that he will complete the task assigned to Draco should Draco fail and that he will protect him and make sure he doesn\'t get hurt. Harry, Ron and Hermione, while in Diagon Alley, spot Draco entering Borgin and Burkes and taking part in a ritual with other Death Eaters, and become suspicious of his actions.At Hogwarts, the school is under tight security to prevent the Death Eaters from entering the school. With Slughorn back to teach Potions, Snape is given Defense Against the Dark Arts. Harry and Ron are encouraged by Professor McGonagall to take up Potions now that Slughorn, with lower standards, is teaching the class; however, as neither was expecting to take the course, they have to find textbooks for themselves in the bookcase. Harry\'s book is annotated with more exact instructions to complete potions, giving him an edge over the other students; he finds that it once belonged to the ""Half-Blood Prince"", a term Hermione cannot figure out. Meanwhile, Ron becomes the successful Gryffindor\'s Quidditch goalie, attracting the love of Lavender Brown, much to Hermione\'s chagrin. Harry is also upset over Ginny\'s attraction to Dean Thomas. During the Christmas Break while Harry and Ron are at the Burrow, the Death Eaters with Bellatrix in charge come intending to kidnap Harry, but are forced to retreat after they are outnumbered by Order of the Phoenix members. Before they leave they set fire to the Burrow, and the Weasleys are gathered outside the house, leaving Harry regretting the evil that he has brought down upon people he cares about.Dumbledore reveals to Harry through the Pensieve memories of Tom Riddle (Voldemort\'s original name), including a false memory from Slughorn, when Riddle asked him about a certain restricted Dark Art. The memory fails to reveal this art, and Dumbledore believes that the key to defeating Voldemort is to learn what Dark Art Riddle asked about, and instructs Harry to further confide himself to Slughorn. Using a Luck potion he won earlier in the school year, Harry is able to bring Slughorn to be intoxicated with Hagrid and convinces the professor in his stupor to give him the true memory. This memory reveals that Riddle inquired about the creation of Horcruxes, devices that store a portion of the creator\'s soul to allow them to live indefinitely. Dumbledore reveals that Riddle\'s diary and his mother\'s ring were two of seven Horcruxes that Riddle had created, and that they must track these down and destroy them to make Voldemort mortal.Meanwhile, Harry continues to be suspicious of Draco\'s actions, following him around the school but no success in determining what he seeks. Harry believes Draco to be behind two indirect attempts on Dumbledore\'s life, one through a cursed necklace that Katie Bell, under an Imperius Curse, was bringing to Dumbledore as a gift, and another through a bottle of poisoned wine that Slughorn, similarly cursed, planned to give to the professor. The latter is discovered accidently when Ron ingests the poison; though he recovers with medical treatment, he unconsciously mumbles Hermione\'s name in front of Lavender, sending her away crying. After this incident, Harry corners Draco in the toilets and after a short fight casts the Sectumsempra curse from the Half-Blood Prince\'s book, severely harming Draco. Snape arrives knowing that he let Draco get hurt and that he broke one of the promises and heals him. Ginny convinces Harry to hide the book in the Room of Requirement to prevent him from using it again; there, they discover, unknown to them, a Vanishing Cabinet, which Draco has been attempting to repair, but think nothing of it further. Ginny also reveals her love for Harry, and they kiss after she hides the book.Dumbledore implores Harry to help him recover another Horcrux, the location of which he recently learned. The two transport themselves to a seaside cliff, and enter a cave where the Horcrux is located. On a small crystalline island, Dumbledore forces Harry to make him drink a mind-altering liquid in order to reveal the Horcrux. While Dumbledore recovers from the liquid, Harry recovers the Horcrux, a small pendant. Harry tries to help Dumbledore recover, but they are attacked by numerous inferi. Dumbledore recovers in time to set them aflame, and the two return to the Astronomy Tower at Hogwarts.Dumbledore, still weakened by the trial, instructs Harry to go to get Snape. However, before Harry can go, footsteps are heard, and Dumbledore tells Harry to hide on the lower floor. The footsteps belong to Draco, who prepares to kill Dumbledore, but cannot bring himself to do so. Meanwhile, with the Vanishing Cabinet fixed, Bellatrix and other Death Eaters are able to invade Hogwarts through a similar cabinet at Borgin and Burkes, and join Draco in the tower. Snape silently arrives on the lower floor, indicating to Harry to stay quiet, and then goes upstairs, joining the other Death Eaters. Snape then casts the killing spell Avada Kedavra on Dumbledore, throwing him over the side of the Tower and killing him. Snape, Draco, and the other Death Eaters depart the school, Bellatrix casting the Death Eaters\' sign over the school, destroying the Great Hall and setting fire to Hagrid\'s hut in glee. Harry tries to stop them with the Sectumsempra spell, but Snape deflects it and stuns him. As he departs, he explains to Harry that he is the Half-Blood Prince and the creator of the spell.Harry returns to the school to find the staff and students mourning over Dumbledore\'s death. Harry walks over to Dumbledore\'s body lying in front of them, grieving as Ginny comforts him. When he returns to the late headmaster\'s office one last time, McGonagall confronts him and asks him to open up to her, but he does not comply and leaves. A portrait of Dumbledore can be seen hanging on a wall behind them.Harry reveals to Ron and Hermione that the Horcrux they got was a fake, containing a message from an ""R.A.B."" that stated he had already taken it, but is also seeking to end Voldemort\'s life. Harry tells his friends that he does not plan to return next year, instead seeking out R.A.B. and the other Horcruxes so that he may put an end to Voldemort; Ron and Hermione remind Harry that they are his friends and will help alongside him in his goal.']"
60,Wizarding World,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1,926084,"['Just for the record, I love the books(for a while Philosopher\'s Stone was a huge favourite of mine) and I personally like the films. None of them are masterpieces, but they are likable, entertaining and I think well made too. I saw Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 with high expectations, there were many friends of mine who said it was brilliant and the best yet. After seeing it with my family last night I have to say Amen! This was a wonderful film in my opinion, and it does a very good job sticking to a mammoth story. I also think they made the right decision splitting it into two parts, if they hadn\'t the result I think would have been too rushed.If I do have a criticism here, I do agree that the pacing is rather slow. I think it started and ended brilliantly, it was the middle where it dragged with a lot of admiring the scenery. As beautiful as it was, it didn\'t admit much to the story.Criticism aside, I adored the production values. The darker scenes were indeed dark and somewhat bleak, especially the beginning at Malfoy Manor where it looked like a film noir, while the scenery in the middle of the film was gorgeous. The music was another delight, it was sweeping, grandiose, majestic, for me the most complex and most atmospheric of all the Harry Potter movie scores. The script is an improvement too, not that it was terrible in the other movies, but especially I thought the humour was better judged(ie. Moody\'s comment about the polyjuice potion), while the story despite the slow pacing was never less than engrossing.There are a few scenes too that I especially liked. One was Dobby\'s death, I thought it was heart-rending. Dobby was so lovable and funny, and in this instalment cute too I think(loved the trainers), although I knew it was going to happen I couldn\'t help shedding tears. I think what got me were his last words, they were so poetic and touching. Another was Godric\'s Hollow, like the former I knew it was coming but it was done in an atmospheric and unnerving way I couldn\'t help jump. I was also taken with the first ""obliviate"" scene, the regret in Hermione\'s face and voice made it incredibly poignant, while the 7 Potters chase was both funny and thrilling. My favourite though was the Three Brothers animated sequence. I was wondering how they were going to do that, and after seeing that scene I have to applaud the writers. It was a clever and beautifully done sequence, with some haunting images especially with death. Harry and Hermione\'s dance got mixed reactions in the cinema, some thought it was awkward and others like me liked it, at that one I thought they were going to kiss which I don\'t think would have gone down well.Yates\'s direction is also much better than it has been. It wasn\'t bad in the other two films, but here it looked as though he took real charge, and all the pivotal scenes here were in general wonderfully handled. The acting is mostly very good. Daniel Radcliffe is likable enough, and Rupert Grint has great comic timing. Emma Watson I think gives her best performance of the series so far and she steals every scene she\'s in, while Alan Rickman while not in much is deliciously suave and dour. The two standouts for me were Helena Bonham Carter, whose Bellatrix was powerful and sometimes even scary and Ralph Fiennes who was really quite creepy sometimes without saying much at all. Bill Nighy\'s Scrimgeour is good but not as memorable, while I do think they wasted the Dursleys.Overall, a rock solid film that ended in a perfect place and my personal favourite of the series so far. In fact, it makes me all the more excited for the next. 9/10 Bethany Cox', ""Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows, Part I finds young Harry played by Daniel Radcliffe and his posse Rupert Grint and Emma Watson fugitives after a palace coup at Hogwarts. The academy of magic has been taken over by Professor Rufus Snape after headmaster Dumbledore has been killed. It's not just that Harry and his friends know too much, it's that Harry has a mysterious connection with the mysterious black lord Voldemort, the evil genius behind all the bad things happening. And Voldemort is quite anxious to sever the connection and sever young Mr. Potter from immortality.In this next to last of the Harry Potter series the familiar cast goes through their usual paces as young Harry and his friends are exiled from Hogwarts and have to live by their wits, knowledge of magic, and the help of friends. The Deathly Hallows refer to three charmed objects that he must destroy to keep Voldemort from taking over the world of magic.This film received Academy Award recognition with Oscar nominations for Best Visual Effects and Best Art Direction. One thing the Potter films have done is certainly brought an appreciation of Charles Dickens to the young. After you've read J.K. Rowling's work, you will love how she's given such descriptive names to her characters in the way Dickens used to. And if Harry Potter isn't a 21st reincarnation of David Copperfield, then I don't know my Dickens."", ""Without a doubt the worst Harry Potter film yet, and this is somebody who didn't like the last three entries in the series, either. The decision to split the seventh book into two parts mean that this one is long winded and preoccupied with needless trivia. The first, better half is similar to ORDER OF THE PHOENIX and HALF BLOOD PRINCE in that it tries to cram too much into too short a space of time. It's all about the detail, and any attempts at atmosphere or suspense are bypassed in favour of storytelling (and don't get me started on the lameness of the horcrux plotting). The second half of the film involves one long camping trip in the woods, spicing things up with a little sexuality and violence. It's as dull and pointless as it sounds.The worst mistake is wasting one of the biggest ensemble casts in British film history. Why cast the likes of Alan Rickman, Brendan Gleeson, Robbie Coltrane, Rhys Ifans, Jason Isaacs, Timothy Spall, David Thewlis, Ralph Fiennes, Helena Bonham Carter et al when none of them get more than a couple of minutes screen time apiece. Daniel Radcliffe appears bored, itching to take on more adult roles, while Rupert Grint barely registers. Hermione turned from an engagingly cute bookworm into whiny, frowning, petulant little character a long time ago and I ended up praying that the scriptwriters would change the story and kill her off. No such luck.Add in some poor editing, seen-it-all-before type special effects and poor action sequences and you have an aimless, disappointing movie with a tired feel. Take, for instance, the wand battle: it's filmed like a gunfight. Gunfights have been filmed in thousands of movies, wand fights in only a few, so why go down the dull and clichéd route instead of thinking of something more spectacular? Just one example of the deficit of imagination found everywhere in this film."", ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 (2010) *** (out of 4)After the death of Dumbledore, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) finds himself on the run as everyone tries to protect him from Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) and along the way learns who the Deathly Hallows were.I really wasn't a fan of the previous film but this one here turned out to be much better. As I've said in all my reviews up to this point, I haven't read a single story in the series so I'm basically just watching the movies without the benefit of comparing them to anything. Whereas I thought the previous film was somewhat boring a long-winded, that certainly wasn't the case here and I ended up finding this one to be one of the best of the series.What I liked most about this one is that there seemed to be a lot more emotion as the various characters are face some sort of battle against one another. There was a lot of inner fighting among the characters and I must admit that I was shocked to see how much I was caught up in the drama. There were a lot of scenes where Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint were in some sort of drama and the actors perfectly sold it. In fact, to me Watson clearly stole the film here and managed to turn in her best performance.Visually the film is quite impressive, although the special effects certainly aren't as in-your-face as the previous film. Technically speaking the movie is impressive with some great cinematography, a nice rousing score and of course there are some very good performances. The beginning and ending are certainly well done and get your ready for what is to follow."", ""Darkness is descending on the world after the death of Dumbledore. Death eaters are everywhere and growing in power. Harry is on the run. He, Hermione, and Ron must find and destroy all the Hocruxes. All the while they must avoid being captured by Voldemort's forces.We are truly descending into darkness. The forces of good are on the run. The three friends are on their own. It was alway going to be this way. All the previous films have been leading up to this.What this movie needs is continuous danger and action. We need the three to be on the run. However for large sections in the middle, they are hiding rather than running. It's not as visually and cinematically exciting. While I understand that changing the story would be unacceptable. It may be better to add the other character's adventures to spice things up. Overall, I like the dark moody tone."", '""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows 1"" is the seventh out of eight Harry Potter films. It is the year 2009 already and the kids have considerably grown up, a lot has happened already and Potter and the gang get ready for their final battle with Voldemort. We have more evil characters than ever. Lestrange, Umbridge, Snape, Draco, Wormtail etc. (seem to) have joined the Dark Lord. The film is directed once again by David Yates, just like films 5, 6 and 8. It is written again by Steve Kloves who wrote all the Potter films based on Rowling\'s books except one. The film scored Academy Award nominations for its visual effects and art direction, but came short as always. Just no luck with the Academy for Potter.Fans of the franchise will be shocked by the deaths of many (dear) characters such as Mad-Eye, Gobby or Hedwig here. As if it wasn\'t already enough that they had to deal with Dumbledore\'s demise. One of my personal highlights is the story of the three brothers in this movie. Apart from that I really liked Luna Lovegood who stole every scene she was in. Great actress Evanna Lynch and I really want to see more from her in the future. Her character of course isn\'t going to be Potter\'s girlfriend (that would be Ginny), but she\'s too cool for him anyway. Also her dad plays a big role this time. One of my favorite quotes from her is when she says that Potter does not want to talk to them right now, but is simply too polite to say. As mysterious as Draco\'s role is, the same goes for Snape. Or maybe not, as he is downright evil in this film and we won\'t find out the truth until the final chapter.Another highlight would be when Ron, Harry and Hermione were in Britain\'s wilderness on their own. The central characters\' tension, conflicts, but also the bonding are the biggest strength of this film and the harmonic dance sequence with Harry and Hermione is truly a thing of beauty with all the horrible messages pouring in through the radio. The maybe toughest scene to watch was Bellatrix torturing Hermione, also a contender for the whole franchise. It\'s kinda pointless to recommend or not recommend this film as, if you consider watching this, you have liked the earlier films anyway. I personally believe it is a pretty good film and builds up nicely to the 8th and last chapter of the hyper-successful Harry Potter franchise. Of course, it was also once again among the most commercially successful films of the year, but that\'s a given.', ""Voldemort's power is increasing and has taken control of Hogwarts and the Ministry of Magic. Those standing against him have fled to regroup in a safer place albeit at great personal risk to themselves in their attempts to protect Harry. When Harry decides to find the rest of the Horcruxes to be able to defeat him, his friends agree to join him. However as darkness grows in the world at large, the trio find themselves facing impossible odds as they discover that Voldemort is pursuing three powerful objects of legend in the world of magic.It took quite a few films but once the series moved away from the introductory stages and got darker, I have started to enjoy them a lot more. OK, I'm not into the story so much that I'm frantic for the final film to come but I am finding the dark tone and content to be much more engaging and satisfying than the more colourful opening films. So I come to the penultimate in the series – although it is the final book split into two parts, which is the better decision since this film runs a bit too long while only covering half of it! HP7a wastes no time in getting dark as we open with several scenes of danger and it sets the tone for the rest of the film where there are many sequences and events that will challenge younger viewers. As an adult (of sorts) I enjoyed this and found that it made the danger more real within the film and thus engaged me more. It needed to do this because there are longer sections of the film where the main characters are hiding out and the drama is between them; these didn't work as well for me because I have less of myself invested in them as people, however they are well interspersed with action so that it never really feels like it is sagging too much.Of course sagging (or rather, lack of conclusion) is a bit of a problem in the film because it is only half of it. The ending in particular does provide a cliff hanger but it doesn't manage to overcome the feeling that, like the lead three, we're waiting for something to happen for a lot of the film rather than actually having a lot happen. It does still work though and I mostly enjoyed it; it helps a lot that the film looks great and that the special effects work to assist the dark content. The cast are reasonably good although some of the dialogue in the character driven scenes I did find a little clunky. The lead three have grown into the parts and mostly they avoid melodrama when there is tension between them. The support cast are generally strong and made up of essentially every living British actor doing small turns to good effect.Harry Potter 7a is not a brilliant film by any means and it does struggle with the fact that it is waiting for the conclusion rather than being the conclusion. However it does provide frequent dark sections and action which keep it lively but have the downside of risking frightening away younger viewers. This dark tone does really make it for me as the film engaged me by just how bleak it was in terms of content and cinematography and, while it is understandably not as good as I would have liked, I did enjoy it and I am now looking forward to a conclusion that can keep this dark, adult tone but also bring everything to a close."", ""I haven't read any Potter books and I do not know how it will all end (the last book has been out for awhile). But I do know that the movies have grown up, as have the fans of the movies. The last book has been filmed as two parts and part one has been released in 2010, while the last episode will come out in 2011. And I might have to re-evaluate this one after watching the end.The end. This will be a sad day for many people. Especially the cinema chains will loose one of the most profitable movie series they had. And they did not even release this movie in 3-D as it was announced. Though it might be better that they didn't. Plus the movie would not have really been that much better with the effect. It is dark as it is (mood and lighting wise) and the 3-D would have made it even more so (which would have been a bad thing).The ending to this one, was carefully chosen and the movie was flowing at a nice speed. I never felt, like I was watching a very long picture. Now, where is the other movie, to see where it is heading."", 'If you\'ve read all the Harry Potter books, then you should know that, as the series went on, they essentially became an allegory for totalitarianism. Certainly one can see that in ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1"". Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson reprise their roles as Harry, Ron, and Hermione, respectively. The three are now having to live almost in secret due to the almost fascistic takeover of the wizarding world by Lord Voldemort\'s (Ralph Fiennes) minions. In fact, while the three are undercover in the office building, the factory looks like something out of Nazi Germany or Stalin\'s USSR: the employees robotically help to publish material which pushes a fear of the ""other"" (in this case Muggles, or non-wizards). Harry, Ron and Hermione are like the French Resistance, one might say.Anyway, it\'s a good thing that they broke the final book into two movies. So far, they\'re doing a really good job not only bringing the magic to the screen, but also warning of the dangers that totalitarian entities - represented here by the Death Eaters - pose. I recommend it.Tom Felton, Jason Isaacs, Helena Bonham Carter, Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane, Warwick Davis, Brendan Gleeson, John Hurt, David Thewlis, Timothy Spall, Imelda Staunton, and Julie Walters reprise their roles from the previous movies, with new additions Bill Nighy and Rhys Ifans.', 'As Harry races against time and evil to destroy the Horcruxes, he uncovers the existence of three most powerful objects in the wizarding world: the Deathly Hallows.I think this film was strong and David Yates did a great job with it, perhaps even better than Guillermo del Toro would have. The return of Dobby is awesome (he is now my favorite character) and the torture scene with Hermione is epic (although cut for the film, I hope to see an extending version some day).The plot is really coming together now, and while there are some things that are not completely clear (I did not read the books), I think I am ready for the final installment.', ""I was quite surprised when I saw the critics had given this first part to the final instalment in the franchise three stars out of five, but I went to see it anyway, and I wish I could say I didn't agree.

To take over the wizard world the main threat is the chosen one who could end the whole thing, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), who is leaving his home with the Dursleys, Uncle Vernon (Richard Griffiths), Aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw) and cousin Dudley (Harry Melling) with the help of the Order of the Phoenix. All the members, including friends Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), and the elders at Hogwarts, Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), Alastor 'Mad-Eye' Moody (Brendan Gleeson) and Remus Lupin (David Thewlis), are willing to protect Harry even if it means death. With the help of the Polyjuice Potion, Harry escapes and those that remain hide at the Weasleys house, where the Minister of Magic, Rufus Scrimgeour (Bill Nighy) gives Harry, Ron and Hermione the items on the last will and testament of recently killed and still mourned Professor Albus Dumbledore (Sir Michael Gambon). At the wedding of Bill Weasley (Domhnall Gleeson) and Fleur Delacour (Clémence Poésy) there is an attack by Death Eaters, and Harry, Ron and Hermione transport to London, where they find the next Horcrux, the key to ending the evil tirade. This Horcurx, a locket, is stolen at one point by someone in the Ministry of Magic, an associate of Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton), but with the Polyjuice Potion to disguise they get it back. The three friends then transport themselves to an empty wood to set up camp and hide from the evil forces, and also try to find a way to destroy the locket, which when worn can increase emotions, especially anger. While Voldermort hears of a legendary Elder Wand which he could use to kill Harry, Ron disappears after becoming jealous of Harry with Hermione, thinking that they are falling for each other, which they are not. Without Ron the two of them stay in the woods, they find out from Bathilda Bagshot (Hazel Douglas) that the famous sword of Godric Gryffindor may be what can destroy the Horcrux, and they visit the grave of Harry's parents Lily and James, and Ron comes back to save Harry and destroy the locket. Next the trio visit Xenophilius Lovegood (Rhys Ifans), father of Luna (Evanna Lynch), to learn of the symbol they have seen a few places, he explains it is the Deathly Hallows (the Elder Wand, the Resurrection Stone and the Cloak of Invisibility). After being captured by the Death Eaters, Hermione is slowly tortured by Bellatrix, with Harry and Ron in the wine cellar who are saved by Dobby (Toby Jones), and there is a small battle before they transport themselves out. In the end, Dobby was injured while transporting Harry, Ron, Hermione and one or two others, they bury him on the beach they landed on, and also Voldermort has found the Elder Wand he can kill Harry with, buried in the coffin of Dumbledore, to be continued... Also starring John Hurt as Ollivander, Bonnie Wright as Ginny Weasley, Timothy Spall as Wormtail, Julie Walters as Molly Weasley, Helen McCrory as Narcissa Malfoy, Mark Williams as Arthur Weasley, James Phelps as Fred Weasley, Oliver Phelps as George Weasley, Matthew Lewis as Neville Longbottom, Katie Leung as Cho Chang, Nick Moran as Scabior, Sophie Thompson as Mafalda Hopkirk, Miranda Richardson as Rita Skeeter and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade's Michael Byrne as Gellert Grindelwald. The three leading young stars are still reliable, maybe particularly Grint, the idea of mainly the three of them on a road trip is I suppose a good getaway from the school, but all the other actors don't get to do much. The special effects are still great, the animated sequence telling the Deathly Hallows story is beautiful, and there are still some good action style moments, but I didn't feel as enthralled as the all four star previous films, but it is an enjoyable enough family fantasy adventure. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction and Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Special Visual Effects and Best Make Up/Hair. Harry Potter was number 45 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, but he was also number 35 on The 100 Worst Britons (the only fictional person, why?). Good!"", ""As Harry and Ron and Hermoine and everyone else has grown up, so have the audiences with the Potter franchise. So it should make some sense that by the time the seventh book has come around that it's coming down to the wire: the big showdown between Harry and the Man-We-Don't-Speak- His-Name, oh, whatever, Voldemort. It's usually that the mid-point movie (i.e. Empire Strikes Back) is the darkest one, but there was a quasi-dark ending to Half-Blood Prince, so it makes more sense that the filmmakers take Rowling's Deathly Hallows and turn it into what it should be: a ripping good apocalypse yarn.I kid a little, but it is a movie with a lot of black contours and desolation, as the trio might be walking through the British version of The Road minus some of the gray-scale photography. That, and the main 'plot' being that Harry has to find the horcruxes, which are items that could be used by Voldemort for very evil purposes. But then the next problem comes as how to destroy them? It's this section of the film, after a very entertaining section where the three go in disguise as full-grown-ups (a funny and intense scene in the Ministry of Magic), that it gets into a rhythm that is not what one would expect in a big- budget holiday blockbuster. A lot of it is sitting around contemplating, waiting, trying to figure things out, and if the audience gets impatient it's not due to the filmmaker's making it bungled but because the characters are having trouble figuring it out too, and we feel for them. Talking with my wife about the books in relation to the movies, I'm told that book seven is meant to be a character piece for a large part of it when they're in the woods (indeed it's something like a hundred pages of these woods scenes with the three, or sometimes two, of them frustrated in figuring out the symbols and suspense of running from the gestapo- like figures of the Dark Lord). But is Rowling as good at characters as she is at clever plots and intricate details of magic? Yes and no. Yes in that she makes good characters that we want to be around (for the most part, sometimes Ron gets on ones nerves), and no in that they are at best two dimensional figures, even with Harry, and there's only so much character to explore. But there are instances where one can excuse the tedium of some of these woods scenes. A moment where Harry and Hermoine have a levity pause and dance to music could be seen as extraneousness, but when it has the music of Nick Cave signing sad blues, why carp?David Yates' direction has found after a few of these movies- Order of the Phoenix still the best of his efforts but not far ahead of this one- and he has a classical style as far as big-budget high-action-adventure movies go in Hollywood. He can let an actor's rhythm speak for itself, and he has a really wonderful scene for a whole mess of top-tier British talent (i.e. Ralph Fiennes, Alan Rickman, Helena Bonham Carter et all) in the opening scene at Voldermort's castle. When it's exciting such as a fast-paced chase in the sky, it's exciting, and when it needs to slow down there's still attention to be paid to what's going down. Only a few points that a non-book reader such as myself such as a wedding scene for a minor character from movies past and a few points of reference for a couple of items or characters get lost on me.This is the kind of production that has great attributes and only a couple of damning liabilities, though the former outweighs the latter. There's a sequence where the story of the Deathly Hallows- how the three men who made deals with death for items and things- is told with a unique animation style that has silhouettes and figures that look like a Tim Burton special. It's one of the most breathtaking passages in any Potter movie, sophisticated to the point of impressing any serious fan of fable-storytelling. But the downsides... well, again, some of the pacing in those woods scenes are less than great. But more than that is a kind of curious aspect to the climax, which without spoiling much involves a character who we've only seen in one other Potter movie (I leave this non-spoiler for those who haven't read the books - those that do know what I mean already), and it's a tragic fate for the character. It's a fine moment of drama, but it lacks the punch that was likely there in the book as it's a character who is barely in the film itself and will need some memory-digging for the character's significance before.But as far as movies where artistic integrity takes place over dumb-loud action and is able to weave visual fx with the practical side of sets and costumes and things with the CGI is very commendable. It's no wonder that Guillermo del-Toro came close to directing this movie, as it appeals to a sensibility that reads the fantastical and supernatural as part of the world, even if one can't see it quite at first. Oh, and the other downside I almost neglected... it's the first part of a two-part finale. It's like getting a half slice of a BIG epic movie, so it's still big, but half-big. But as far as half-slice epics go, it's one of the best in the franchise."", ""After the slightly below par 5th and 6th instalments of this saga I was pleasantly surprised with this entry.All the Hogwart aspects of these films are stripped away making this film feel more like a road movie as Harry and his friends search for objects that will destroy the evil Voldemort.It's not without its slow moments but overall this film maintains the ever growing darkness that this series has been brewing towards while also allowing the three principle performers to play some scenes with depth. The cut off point for this film feels rightly placed while also leaving the audience wanting more. All of the normal faces from previous films return albeit briefly but this film much like the last two feel like a drawn out build up for the final film."", 'This film is the adventure of Harry Potter, who is on the quest to find the Horcruxes of Lord Vordemont.I find the newest instalment of Harry Potter a little confusing, as I have only very vague recollections of what happened in previous books or films. The fast pace and the assumed knowledge of previous stories make it hard to follow at times. Putting that aside, ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1"" is entertaining as it is action packed and thrilling. The special effects are quite impressive too. There are so many moments that scared me out of my chair, with the sound effects successfully augmenting the scary visuals. I look forward to the next film, where they round up the whole series.', 'As the ultimate wizarding battle between good and evil draws ever closer, Harry, Hermione and Ron bunk off from Hogwarts to go search for the ""Horcruxes"" with which to halt the ever stronger Voldermort and his army, on the way they learn the importance of the Deathly Hallows artifacts.So this is the one that sees the comfort confines of Hogwarts left behind as our intrepid trio of best pals hit the mountains and forests in search of the tools to stop old snake face in his tracks. In what is ultimately a chase/escape movie, one where the characters have to fight not only a number of challenges that come their way, but also their new found in-fighting capabilities, Deathly Hallows 1 wonderfully dangles the carrot for the final series entry to come. But the overriding thoughts you come away with from it is that firstly it\'s not really that much fun, and secondly that it shouldn\'t have been a stand alone movie. Too much of it plods where exposition and padding strains to get the film through its near two and half hour running time. Without the hustle and bustle of Hogwarts, and the myriad of characters that reside within, film struggles to escape the over reliance on just three central characters and a ream of MacGuffins. While some of the comedy and tender moments fall flat because tone is firmly pitched at dark clouds a gathering. However, where it does reward is with the action sequences, with David Yates once again proving he\'s a considerable talent when it comes to directing such passages.New additions to the cast list feature Rhys Ifans, Peter Mulan and Bill Nighy, all welcome, and all sadly underused. As is the return of some older characters from earlier series entries (do you remember John Hurt was in the first film?!). While the thread involving the Ministry of Magic, and its nasty transformation into a Nazi like call for non-magical folk ethnic cleansing, is supremely adult and hits the nerves as it should do. Of the three principal young adult actors, it\'s still Emma Watson leading the way on ability, but alongside her, Radcliffe and Grint have earned our love and respect over the years for having to carry the weight of such expectation that has come with these roles. Fact is, is that now, having grown up with them and their characters for over ten years, we surely can accept them for not being multi ranged child actors. They have had to embody one character each for a decade, the range as such is the naturalism of aging through childhood like they have. Job done!Tension is high and the magical moments engage big time, but the draggy nature of the beast makes this a film purely working as an appetiser to something sure to be far bigger and better. 6/10', 'Pretty decent movie but I think the book is better', 'These hallows are not only ""deathy,"" they\'re ""darker than dark."" Your enjoyment of this fascinating installment in the Potter series will depend largely on how much you don\'t mind that the screen becomes darker than dark for many of the night scenes. It\'s the only flaw in the transfer of the film to DVD. Whether this is the fault of the original theatrical film, I don\'t know but the lighting technicians didn\'t account for correct light exposure, that\'s for sure.Other than that, the performances are all first-rate, especially those of DANIEL RADCLIFFE, EMMA WATSON and RUPERT GRINT, this time getting their main share of the spotlight in a story where the supporting players are strictly ""in support."" All three of them prove themselves capable of carrying the film on the strength of their own talent.Even names like MICHAEL GAMBON, BRENDAN GLEESON, ALAN RICKMAN, HELENA BONHAM CARTER and IMELDA STAUNTON have little to do as far as actual screen time is concerned. Carter\'s most impressive moments are obscured by the dark lighting employed in most of her scenes so that she is scarcely even recognizable.The story involves the quest of the three young Wizards to track down and destroy Voldemort\'s secret of immortality and destruction by finding the Horcruxes that threaten their survival. On the way, they leave the confines of Hogwarts and have to fend for themselves among all the forces Voldemort has sent to destroy them. We only get a few glimpses of RALPH FIENNES as the terrifying Volemort, but it\'s enough to make you want to see the grand finale in Part 2 of this series.Summing up: Many of the ""dark"" scenes are too dark for eye comfort, but then the whole story has a dark atmosphere of brooding and impending evil about to erupt. Hopefully, the final installment will provide a satisfying conclusion to Harry\'s odyssey. The special effects are as clever as ever, particularly for the segment involving the seven Harry Potters.', 'These Harry Potter movies are starting to make me grumpy.Coming out of ""Half-Blood Prince,"" I felt that the filmmakers didn\'t even try to make the film coherent to people who hadn\'t already read the book, and that trend continues with the first half of ""Deathly Hallows."" To make matters worse, all fun and whimsy have been drained out of this story, so not only was I confused, I was also depressed. The who\'s who of adult British actors that have been the only reason to stick with this series in the first place are mostly absent, save for an initial action sequence that stands as this film\'s highlight. It all goes downhill from there, and most of the movie consists of Harry, Hermione and Ron (and mostly just Harry and Hermione), sitting around in barren, rocky places looking gloomy. (If the kids can whisk themselves away anywhere, why don\'t they at least go into hiding someplace warm and sunny?) These characters simply aren\'t interesting enough to carry an entire film, and the absence of Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, Brendan Gleeson (who bites it off screen early on but whose death is treated so casually by the script that you might not even know he died), David Thewlis, etc. is sorely missed.The film\'s production values and sheer technical skill are enough to mask the fact that the script doesn\'t make any sense, and it\'s not until after the movie is over and you\'ve had a chance to ruminate on it that you begin to feel like you\'ve been snowed.I will see the final installment because I might as well now, but it damn well better be good.Grade: C', ""While I don't intend to spoiler plot, I daresay I may spoiler a number of bits and pieces. So beware.The final HP book becomes a two-part movie, the first part of which is notable for the fact that not a single bit of it takes part at Hogwarts. The overall tone is full of foreboding, and rightly so - Voldemort is winning, well and truly, and Harry, the only hope for the forces of good, is forced on the run. This sense of foreboding is cemented right at the start by a short scene where Hermione wipes every trace of her own existence from her parents' life for their protection - a moment of such desperate sadness that it tells you how high the stakes are before anything else happens (just in case you had forgotten Dumbledore's death at the end of Half-Blood Prince).There is a lot of action in this film, but not much story actually happens, and it doesn't have much of a plot of its own. This was one of the joys of the earlier books/films - each had a solid story and it wasn't until several volumes in that you came to appreciate that you were seeing episodes in a much larger story. Well, that larger story is approaching its climax, but rather slowly.Having said that, the film always holds your attention, perhaps because there is some long overdue depth offered to the developing relationships between the three principals. Given that the three are thrown together for an extended sequence simply staying out of sight of Voldemort's faction, this perhaps inevitable. This sequence, which dragged quite badly in the novel, actually works well on screen, and Radcliffe, Watson and Grint all acquit themselves well. Again, one can hardly take one's eyes off Watson, and it is good to see Grint given a bit more to do than his usual comedy double takes while looking gormless.In among the general darkness there are some genuinely creepy and upsetting moments, as well as a couple of moments which make you realise that these kids are now young adults.Almost all previous surviving character cast members (with the notable exception of Maggie Smith) put in appearances, and I was struck by how perfectly cast these movies have been.For a film which has, probably, less story than any of its predecessors, I enjoyed it more than most of them."", ""It's ironic that many have hailed this movie as boring, a waste of time, and a shameless moneymaker, when I actually enjoyed it for two of those reasons. In the recently dramatic Hogwarts years, with beloved characters dropping like flies, isn't it nice to be able to catch your breath and watch two teenagers wander around in the forest without anything bad happening to them? And really, who cares that you spent an extra seven dollars at the movie theaters-which was the ticket price in 2010-since you got to see characters you grew up with in a world you immersed yourself in the past nine years up on the big screen? It doesn't seem like that big of a deal to me, and since the movies preceding and following Part One are so heavy, a respite is welcome.In this movie, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson decide to leave school and pursue the destruction of the great villain destroying all the good in the wizarding world. They're on the lookout for several magical objects that house part of Ralph Fiennes's power, but since the final book got split into two movies, it's a fair assumption that they don't accomplish their goal in this one. For most of the movie, the trio wanders around near the ocean, by the forest, and in their friends' houses. If that sounds incredibly boring, have no fear. Rupert becomes enormously moody and jealous, and he leaves their party of three. Dan and Emma continue to wander around by themselves, and as they're in very close quarters, they bond. Plenty of fans include their spontaneous dance as one of their favorite moments of the entire franchise. It's sweet, casual, and their chemistry lights up the screen like fireflies.The movie isn't completely without drama, tears, or violence. After all, the teenagers are trying to save the wizarding world and take down an incredibly powerful and evil bad guy with no nose! I liked this one better than Part Two because many people make it out of this movie alive, and even though there are some sad bits, it's not overwhelmingly depressing. Also included in this one is a pretty cool animated sequence explaining the meaning of the title that feels simultaneously realistic and stylized."", ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1 (2010): Dir: David Yates / Cast: Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, Ralph Fiennes, Helena Bonham Carter: First part of an exciting franchise conclusion. There is an interesting back story regarding what the Deathly Hallows refers too but symbolically is makes no real claims. The young heroes are older and the evil lord Voldemort wants young wizard Harry Potter dead so to avoid this Potter is put under protection. Eventually they are on a quest to destroy a locket that contains part of Voldemort's soul. Director David Yates is a veteran in these films and here he nears the characters closer to doom. The ending is a cliffhanger but a satisfactory one where self sacrifice becomes the norm. Daniel Radcliffe as Potter is at his most responsible as he takes charge of his life to face the inevitable. Rupert Grint as Ron Weasily struggles with emotions that cause friction but he renders his biggest victory when faced with deception. Emma Watson as Hermione Granger is invaluable with her intelligence and well placed magic. Finally there is Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort whose presence is ominous in his search for a powerful wand that can out match Potter's. His final scene opens the door nicely for part 2. It also should be noted that Helena Bonham Carter plays one hell of a superb psychotic bitch. These films were always entertaining but young children need discernment before viewing. Fantastic special effects abound include an exciting motorcycle chase through the skies, looming large serpents, and an enchanting world full of surprises. Score: 7 / 10"", ""Voldemort's power is growing stronger. He now has control over the Ministry of Magic and Hogwarts. Harry, Ron, and Hermione decide to finish Dumbledore's work and find the rest of the Horcruxes to defeat the Dark Lord. But little hope remains for the Trio, and the rest of the Wizarding World, so everything they do must go as planned..after seeing the Half blood Prince, i was not looking forward to this entry in the series one bit. They have cut the film into two to make more money (even though the makers say it's to elaborate the story, i can't remember a dance sequence in the book), and Yates was back to direct the film again.Yates has usurped himself this time and brought ut a fast paced, witty and sometimes downright frightening (I hate snakes) entry into the long running series.even thought the majority of the film is the trio camping and trying o find a way to destroy an amulet, the action really never lets up in the films lengthy run times.okay, the film can feel a little like a quest for a certain ring sometimes with the three of them walking along the countryside and sometimes arguing and letting certain things influence their minds, but this is a minor quibble in what has to be the best Potter film since 'Prisoner'.The three leads do not look like they are reading straight from the books now, and they even get a little bit saucy throughout, in fact the script is packed with innuendo'it's ten inches but nothing special''thats a strange thing to wear in your sock'but this only adds to the entertainment factor.The only real problem with the film is the slew of Brit actors who were quite famous when the first film was released, now, just standing in the background not really doing anything but looking thankful for being in the film (Mark Williams come forward) and this happens quite regularly that it can become distracting.But the real treat is the animated segment of the deathly hallows, very surreal and very eerie, perhaps the most involving bit of the film.Feinnes oozes menace whenever he is onscreem and easily steals the film from under everyone involved, closely followed by Watson.If you look a little closer in the connotations of the film, it's all going a little bit Star Wars, but that should not hinder such a well made movie and such a good step up from the dirge of the last film.See it now and then moan for eight months until part 2.But it's nice to have that feeling again, so long after the end of the two towers finished."", ""This is not a run of the mill series, but something which has been intricately planned for from almost the very beginning. With the last few films crafting the level of suspense into a crescendo, where each film augments the impending doom and gloom culminating in the finale seen in The Half Blood Prince, things get a lot worst here from the start, where The Deathly Hallows begins with a grim reminder from the Minister of Magic, before we see Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) and his ghastly lieutenants plot to take over both realms Muggle or not in quite Fascist terms.Yes you read that right, and what I thought was quite the brilliant stroke of genius to transmit that level of fear and dread into the Potter world through something quite familiar in our world, where there's a takeover of ministries and the installation of past villains who are puppets of the regime, the continued discrimination and probable extermination of the ordinary, non magical Muggles and even the half-breeds against those who are of pure magical blood, and a curious scene where a disguised Potter head inside the undergrounds of the Ministry only to see propaganda being created by the masses in creepy, clockwork like fashion.Everything is doom and gloom with copious amounts of shades, shadows, black and grey (save for Hermione's red dress in one scene), where our heroic trio are quite clueless without their guardian headmaster Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) always ready to pull some strings from behind the scenes. His absence is largely felt, and they are left mostly to their own devices and smarts to try and figure out a way to get to the remaining Horcruxes and to destroy them. They become the hunted with little allies to rely on, where betrayal seem the norm, almost from within their own circle of trust as well where a major subplot continues to dwell on the suggested romantic/platonic dynamics between Hermione with Harry and Ron, the former sharing a curious dance sequence while on the run, and the latter, well having his worst fear confront his lack of courage to tell Hermione just how he feels for her, well, from how many films ago.So the verdict is whether The Deathly Hallows warranted two films. My answer is a resounding, definite yes, because there's so much going on in the story, of the relationships and friendships forged over the years, of the closure both good and bad that has to come to the myriad of characters introduced (J.K. Rowling doesn't show a lot of mercy by the way), and not to mention the inherent quest that Harry, Ron and Hermione chose to embark on that has gone beyond just the survival of Harry Potter, and what's more, introduces to us what those Deathly Hallows actually are, which goes just beyond the destruction of the Horcuxes. Danger lurks at every corner and the narrative spins at breakneck speed, harrowing most times with the frequent close shaves the rookies encounter against their enemies who are growing more powerful by the minute.While the previous films have boasted special effects extravaganzas be it little things to pepper the scene or large battles between wizards and witches, this is kept surprisingly muted in the film since it's swaying on one end of the spectrum with Evil gaining an upper hand, and most of the effects not already something seen before in the earlier Potter films. But what ultimately leads this film into being the more powerful one, is the strength of the story and how it leads you along the way, building anticipation as we root for positive outcomes as much as possible, with slight comedy punctuating appropriate moments to lift the spirits.Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson all share that perfect camaraderie that's been built over the years, it's no wonder that they add that convincing depth and natural realism to their friendship, with an audience that has largely grew up with them as well. There's no ensemble cast like the one assembled for the Potter franchise, though most of them - Ralph Fiennes, Alan Rickman, Helena Bonham Carter, Bill Nighy, Tom Felton and a long list more - come and go too frequent and too soon, but one hopes the evil Death Eaters do get their spotlight by the time the second installment rolls over.Chris Columbus may have begun the film franchise and made it a large welcome for the young (especially) and old to embrace J.K Rowling's magical world, but I am of the opinion that David Yates inherited the franchise at the right point from The Order of the Phoenix where things required a consistent hand rather than a rotating director's chair, and developed the franchise into what it is today in quite unassuming terms. Credit also has to go to Steve Kloves who has adapted from Rowling's books (save for the point where Yates came onboard), knowing what best to adapt into the film, and what to leave behind, steering clear of the more cutesy tales and plunging us headlong into Voldemort's return and ascension to power.You know that this will end in a cliffhanger, and what a cliffhanger it is, whetting your appetite to devour Part 2 as soon as it's released, just so to witness how the film franchise of our generation will fittingly conclude. I can't wait, and I'm sure the hundreds of thousands of fans around the world cannot wait for the next too."", 'Unlike the other six novels in the Harry Potter series ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"" is being filmed in two parts of which this is the first, Part Two being slated for release in July 2011. The reason for this is that J. K. Rowling\'s last Potter novel is a long and complex one and that to film it all in one go would either result in a movie of insane length or involve omitting many scenes and details from the book, something which Potter anoraks would never forgive. (The film-makers took plenty of flak for altering some of Rowling\'s plot details in the earlier instalments).It has become a commonplace to remark that the Potter series has been getting progressively ""darker"", both literally and metaphorically, ever since the third episode, ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"", and ""Deathly Hallows"" continues this trend. The plot is a complex one, concentrating on the efforts of Harry, Ron and Hermione to I will not attempt to summarise it here2010/2011 two-part epic fantasy film to find and destroy the Horcruxes, magical objects which hold Voldemort\'s secret of immortality. The Deathly Hallows of the title are three other magical objects which play an important part in the plot.This film is the first in the series not to be set in Hogwarts School (although we learn that Severus Snape is the new headmaster). Since the death of Albus Dumbledore at the end of the sixth film, there has been a revolution in the wizarding world. Lord Voldemort and his supporters, the Death Eaters, have taken control of the Ministry of Magic and are using their new-found power to impose a quasi-Nazi dictatorship and to persecute Muggle-born or mixed-blood wizards. Whereas the atmosphere of the earlier instalments, especially those directed by Chris Columbus, resembled that of the traditional British boarding school story with added magical elements, parts of ""Deathly Hallows"" are closer to Orwell\'s ""1984"" or similar dystopian satires.""Deathly Hallows Part 1"" is not my favourite of the Harry Potter series; I certainly did not enjoy it as much as the previous entry, ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"". The acting is as good as ever, well up to the normal standards of the series, but the character of Albus Dumbledore was sadly missed. (He died at the end of ""Half-Blood Prince""). Whether played by Richard Harris or Michael Gambon, Dumbledore functioned as a source of wisdom and authority, the moral anchor of the series, and his absence from this film means that something feels lacking. The decision to film the novel in two parts does not seem to have come off, at least as far as Part 1 is concerned. Whereas all the earlier films ended with a satisfying resolution, this one comes to a rather abrupt close, leaving the plot hanging in mid-air. For all its length (nearly 2 1/2 hours), ""Deathly Hallows Part 1"" feels less like a film in its own right than an introduction to another film which will not be released for another few months. We can only hope that part 2 will be better. 6/10', ""For the first part of the seventh film about Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows, potheads might feel a little smarter as the intrepid trio is getting older and a tad wiser themselves. For me, a cynic about any series going beyond three, I was pleased to see Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Hermione (Emma Wattson), and Ron (Rupert Grint) pursuing death with a vengeance and doing some philosophical reflecting. In fact, it is as much an affirmation of life as it is obsessed with death. Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) is so strong now that Hogwarts and the Ministry of Magic are under his power. The trio tries to find and destroy Horcruxes, which are shards of his soul, so as to destroy him. The usual explosions, magic horses, and all sorts of wild things inhabit the landscape as they have in the past six episodes.What's slightly different here is that sex and death are major players, and not necessarily in that order. Sex to the extent that the stirrings of the three teens are a constant challenge with Ron on the losing side (at least the pubescent longings of the sixth have passed, a virtue unknown to the Twilight series). Death to the extent that they seek the Dark Lord's death and acknowledge parents' passing as well as those who die so Harry may live.Director David Yates still stretches scenes beyond what even Rowling may have envisioned, and he still fails to enliven Harry beyond his constantly benign befuddlement. But this time he has given depth to characters commensurate with their growth and intelligence. No magic there, just living."", 'The film begins with Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) starting their search for Voldemort\'s Horcruxes. Meanwhile, Severus Snape arrives at Malfoy Manor to tell Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) and the rest of his council that he\'s been appointed the new Headmaster of Hogwarts. He also tells them that the Order of the Phoenix will be moving Harry Potter from Privet Drive to a safe house. Voldemort uses Lucius Malfoy\'s (Jason Isaacs) wand to avoid using twin wands in a dueling battle.After Harry\'s \'family\' The Dursleys flee their home, the Order of the Phoenix arrive to meet Harry along with six others: Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), Hermione, Fred (James Phelps) and George Weasley (Oliver Phelps), Fleur Delacour (Clémence Poésy) and Mundungus Fletcher (Andy Linden). They all take Polyjuice Potion to become Harry\'s doppelganger\'s.\nHarry and the six copies leave Privet Drive accompanied by a protector whilst the real Harry flies alongside Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) on his flying motorbike.

All but Mad-Eye Moody (Brendan Gleeson), who was killed by Voldemort and Mundungus, who disapparated when he saw Voldemort arrive. George has a bad head wound from a curse Snape conjured during the battle. Ron convinces Harry to remain at the Burrow until after Bill (Domhnall Gleeson) and Fleur\'s wedding before going to find more horcruxes. Minister of Magic, Rufus Scrimgeour (Bill Nighy), arrives at the Burrow and distributes the items from Dumbledore\'s last will and testament to Ron, Hermione and Harry. Ron receives the Deluminator, Harry gets the missing sword of Gryffindor and the first Snitch he ever caught and Hermione gets a personal copy of ""The Tales of Beetle the Bard"". During the wedding, Harry sees Xenophilius Lovegood (Rhys Ifans) and notices a strange symbol on his necklace. Harry speaks to Elphius Doge (David Ryall), one of Dumbledore\'s oldest friends and Ron\'s Aunt Muriel (Matyelok Gibbs) and learns that Dumbledore used to live in Harry\'s hometown, Godric\'s Hollow. A Patronus message sent by Kingsley Shacklebolt (George Harris) appears and warns that the Ministry has fallen, Scrimgeour is dead and that \'they are coming\'. Death Eaters appear and trash the ceremony, leading Ron, Harry and Hermione to apparate to London.Taking refuge in a cafe, they discuss their immediate plans but before they can leave two Death Eaters arrive and begin dueling. The trio win the battle and disapparate to Grimmauld Place where they discover that Regulus Arcturus Black (Sirius\'s younger brother) is the R.A.B in the false locket found at the end of Half-Blood Prince. Kreacher reveals that the real locket was in the house but Mundungus stole it when he looted Grimmauld Place. Harry sends Kreacher to get Mundungus who in turn explains that Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) took it from him in return for not revoking his peddler\'s licence. The trio decide to break into the Ministry, now under the eyes of Death Eaters to retrieve the locket.Harry, Ron and Hermione capture three Ministry workers and impersonate them to enter the secret Ministry offices but are quickly split up. Hermione ends up in a courtroom with Umbridge to witness a false trial, Ron is in Head of Magical Law Enforcement (Death Eater Yaxley\'s) office and Harry is free to wander the corridors since he unwittingly copied a Death Eater Runcorn. Harry eventually finds his way to Umbridge\'s office but doesn\'t find the locket so he makes his way to the courtroom alongside Ron. They reunite with Hermione and stun Umbridge to take the locket and attempt to leave the Ministry. However, their Polyjuice Potion begins to wear off and during the battle to Floo away, Yaxley catches them as they reach Grimmauld Place.\nSince they cannot safely stay at Grimmauld Place now Yaxley is a secret-keeper, Hermione apparates them to a forest. Ron gets splinched in the process, meaning the group can\'t apparate until he has recovered. They attempt to destroy the locket but their magic proves useless on it so they take turns wearing it despite its negative effects on their morale. While wearing it, Harry sees a vision of Voldemort interrogating and killing Gregorovitch (Rade Serbedzija) the wand-maker and going off in search of a mysterious wizard said to have robbed his shop many years ago.As they apparate around the countryside to camp in secluded areas, Ron becomes increasingly suspicious that Harry and Hermione are becoming more than friends. While wearing the locket, Ron overhears Hermione discover that if they can find the sword of Gryffindor, they can destroy all of the Horcruxes. This realisation that they must find another thing in a location they don\'t know, coupled with his rising suspicion and resentment, drives Ron to leave the group and return home. Harry and Hermione are forced to teleport away, leaving Ron no way to return even if he wanted to. Hermione takes his exit badly so Harry dances to a radio with her to try and cheer her up but the romantic situation is too much for Hermione, making her revert back to sadness. Harry decides to visit Godric\'s Hollow, both because it would be the first time since Voldemort attacked him and because he wishes to meet Bethilda Bagshot (Hazel Douglas), a magical historian who claimed to \'know the Dumbledores better than anyone\'. They find the church graveyard and Hermione notices that a grave bearing the name \'Ignotus Peverell\' has the same symbol on it as the one on Mr. Lovegood\'s necklace and in the book left for her by Dumbledore. Harry finds his parents\' gravestones and an old woman approaches them as they pay their respects. Harry guesses that she is Bethilda and they follow her home. Harry sees a picture of the teenager from Gregorovitch\'s memory as Bethilda leads him to the attic of the house. Hermione wanders around downstairs. She finds signs of a bloody attack whilst the woman in front of Harry decomposes before his eyes into Voldemort\'s snake, Nagini. After a fight, Harry and Hermione escape with the only casualty being Harry\'s wand. Hermione says that the teen from the memory was Gellert Grindelwald.In the forest where they spend the night, Harry sees a Patronus doe watching over them and follows it to a frozen pond. He discovers the sword of Gryffindor at the bottom and as he swims down to get it, the locket goes crazy and attempts to drown him. Ron appears and saves him with Harry convincing Ron to destroy the locket with the sword. Harry opens it using Parseltongue. As it opens, a ghostly black cloud erupts from it whilst it shows Ron horrific images including spiders. A ghostly Harry tells Ron that Mrs. Weasley wanted him as a son whilst a ghostly Hermione mocks him, asking him why she\'d choose him over the Chosen One before they begin kissing. Ron angrily attacks the locket, destroying it with the sword before he returns to the tent with Harry. Hermione is furious at Ron for leaving and returning as if nothing happened but the trio decide to visit Mr. Lovegood to find out about the mysterious symbol.At the Lovegood house, Mr. Lovegood teaches them about the Deathly Hallows - an invincible Elder Wand, a Resurrecting Stone and the invisibility cloak - and tells them the story of the three Peverell brothers who owned them all. When the group attempts to leave, Mr Lovegood reveals that Death Eaters have taken his daughter, Luna (Evanna Lynch) and that he must keep them there before they give her back. They escape the ensuing attack but apparate to a previous camping ground where a group of Snatchers are waiting to capture them and take them to the Ministry. Hermione uses a Stinging Hex on Harry\'s face to disfigure it but the Snatchers see the scar under the swelling. Instead, they take the trio to Malfoy Manor to collect the reward for Harry\'s capture.Since the Malfoys and Bellatrix Lestrange (Helena Bonham Carter) can\'t be sure the disfigured wizard is Harry, despite the fact he\'s travelling with Ron and Hermione, they refrain from summoning Voldemort until the swelling has gone down. However, Bellatrix sees the sword and believes it to be in her vault at Gringott\'s Bank. She imprisons Harry and Ron in a cellar where they find Luna, Ollivander (John Hurt), and a goblin. Bellatrix meanwhile brutally tortures Hermione to try to find out how they stole the sword. Wormtail takes the goblin upstairs to be interrogated, and Harry summons Dobby (Toby Jones), who frees Luna and Ollivander before breaking Harry and Ron out. They go to rescue Hermione and the goblin, but despite winning the duels with Dobby\'s help - Harry manages to win Draco\'s wand and picks up Bellatrix\' wand - Bellatrix throws a knife that stabs and kills Dobby as they disapparate. Harry gives Dobby a proper burial on the beach where they appear.The movie ends with Voldemort opening Dumbledore\'s tomb and taking the Elder Wand.']"
61,Wizarding World,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2,1201607,"[""What can I say... This was by far the most amazing finale any fan could have asked for. I cried, I laughed, I was short of breath in many instances, I was disturbed, but overall I was thoroughly satisfied with the conclusion of this series. I felt something amazing after the movie ended, something I didn't feel after reading the book. Being able to watch the end of Harry Potter on the big screen really brought the impact of just how much this series has touched not only my life, but the lives of everyone around me. Deathly Hallows Part 2 is by far (in my opinion) the best movie of 2011 and quite possibly one of the best movies of all time. I don't want to give any spoilers I just want to express how happy I am with this film. It picks up where Part 1 left off, all of the characters get the closure they deserve, and the story just comes full circle!BRAVO!!! That is all I have to say. Thank you to everyone involved in these movies for taking the world on such an amazing journey. J.K Rowling, thank you for writing such a masterpiece that will truly live on in my heart, and so many others hearts for years to come.Go see this movie!"", ""At the start of J.K. Rowling, thank you for this wonderful series of books forever. I can tell you this current state of my childhood and my future. Sign up everywhere it has always been a part of Harry Potter's name. I'd say the most important series of my life. I owe my childhood such wonderful pass to the books and movies of this series. In this series, even though I know better than the series it has always been a special place for me in this series and it will always continue. This movie is definitely the best in the series. And the players is the most mature film. You feel throughout the film until the end of the final air and this is an amazing thing for fans like me. Book series as well as certainly never did. However, in each film it was pretty cool. And with incredible finale made this film. Harry certainly kept the best for last. Put all the music from the beginning to the end of the movie you are very successful and internal chills. You feel deeply cool is really going on. When the film ended up being a very big gap within you. Of course, you are a part of this world..."", ""I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter books, they're all so great and magical. But I didn't think the film series were perfect at all, but they were still great movies. With that, I was extremely excited to see the end of the film franchise, and impressed with the trailers. So I had high expectations. And thankfully it did not disappoint, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II, blew past my already high expectations and I was enthralled!The whole movie looked spectacular! The cinematography extremely well done, the art direction was incredible. The movie was beautiful to look at, the visuals were spectacular and truly Oscar worthy! The set designers, cinematographers really need to be awarded for their work, because it looks like they spend of time and money on the look of the film. The cast of the film was pretty much perfect, they should all be applauded too. Emma Watson, as usual is and great and she'll have a bright career ahead of her. Rupert Grint is pretty much great also, he is a fine actor indeed. Daniel Radcliffe did an amazing job and was very memorable as Harry Potter. Although I think Ralph Fiennes was the star of the film, he did unbelievable job as the evil, crazy Lord Voldemort, I think he deserves an Oscar Nomination for his role. The rest of the cast were also great too.We all grew up overtime with the series, we followed the adventures of Harry Potter for around 10 years, I think. It seems very weird that there will be no more Harry Potter films to look forward too. I will miss the franchise very much! However I am happy the series got an amazing ending. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II is not only the best film in the series, but it will probably be one of the best films of 2011. Everyone should see this film, even if they don't like past Harry Potter films."", ""This movie could not do any better, it ended the Harry Potter series with a bang. It is a good balance from the first part of The Deathly Hallows. The first part was more of a drama, while part two was action packed left and right. This may be my favorite movie of the series, though all of them are equally amazing. I have read the books, and there are definitely major changes in the movie, but I find they fit perfectly well with the story, even if it isn't the original plot. Even for those who haven't read the books (why wouldn't you?!), it is equally enjoyable. This movie, along with the rest in the series, will be loved for years and years to come."", ""I saw this at a preview screening in London.Deathly Hallows part 2 ends this incredibly well produced saga with tremendous grace and a beautifully orchestrated climax that I am sure will satisfy both lovers of the books and films.If you have read the books as I have you will be glad to know major key moments are intact. Much is missing but I won't dwell on that, no point, its how well this movie plays out and for me it rolls wonderfully between excitement, thrills and emotional drama towards a satisfactory (though a slightly rushed) conclusion. There are at least 2 sequences so powerful that I defy anyone not to at least stifle a tear or choke a little. One of those sequence is an exquisitely executed flashback that is pivotal to the whole story. I have to say, that despite the woes we book readers have when elements (big chunks of it too) are omitted from the movies, much credit still has to go to Steve Kloves for adapting the books for the big screen, cleverly weaving, changing and even adding new big elements to give a kinetic flow to the narrative and here it all comes together superbly.David Yates assured direction has nurtured our young actors in the last 4 films to blossom into even more adept actors who convey their characters with natural tones without overacting. Daniel Radcliffe had to carry this movie more than any other and has done so brilliantly complemented with great support from his two companions, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint.Pretty much all the characters we have met in all the movies have made an appearance in this finale but one actor stands out, Alan Rickman. His portrayal of Professor Snape has always been a joy to watch (if a little novel) but here his scenes will leave a dramatic engraving in my memory. Here he elevates his portrayal of one of the most complex character in young adult literature to an unforgettable piercingly emotional one.Another actor who really shines in the few scenes that he has, is Matthew Lewis as Neville Longbottom who we see gradually transforming over the past films from the clumsy bullied boy to a brave warrior in this final film. Many other British thespians of the series also have their few moments to shine especially Maggie Smith's Professor McGonagal who was a delight to watch as she takes charge of the defence of Hogwarth School.As for the spectacle of the battle and showdowns, while not at the scale of Lord of the Rings, I honestly cant think how it could have been done better as the film makers have intertwined heart stopping action with dramatic progressions in the narrative. Its actually more visceral and dynamic than the rather smaller scale battle of the brilliant novels (not to take anything away from Rowling's writing). Do I have any gripes? Yes I do. Although I applaud Steve Kloves for a difficult screenplay adaption...I think he could still have done better at explaining some odd anomalies that only readers of the book will understand. This might annoy you if you haven't read the books. But its a small gripe because what we get is delightful.What an amazing achievement to faithfully bring Rowling's epic saga to the big screen with the same cast and largely the same crew, maintaining the brilliant quality right to the end.Oh my god, its only just sinking in, this was the end....but what a great great end."", ""Even though I consider myself to be a huge HP fan I never thought I would actually give a movie from this series straight 10 out of 10. Just saw the movie today and the word epic is almost an understatement. This movie really lives up to the promises that have been made. Further more it is (in my opinion at least) the movie that stays most loyal to the book. I did miss some scenes from the book yet nothing relevant was left out. I don't want to give out any spoilers 'cause I don't want to ruin it for you but if you have read the book it will be very easy to follow and if not - well I think it still makes sense most of the time. I highly recommend you to watch it whether you're a fan or not. 10/10"", ""Overall, it may be said that the movie was good. The direction, cinematography & the special effects were brilliantly executed. The acting was good too. The children have grown so much.But, this isn't the way The Harry Potter saga was meant to end. A movie which is supposed to mark the End of an Era could have been much better. With the expectations I had, I was a little disappointed. It DID NOT have the depth and the emotional impact WASN'T nearly as good as the book. I was pleased with Part 1 because it stuck very well to the book. That's what I was expecting with this too. But no... they had to spoil it. What's the use of making the movie in two parts if they can't do justice to the book? They should have made it a Trilogy (as all great movies are made, like 'The Godfather Trilogy', 'The LOTR Trilogy', original 'Star Wars Trilogy', The Bourne Trilogy', etc.) or they should have increased the length of the 2 parts. Who forced them to fit the whole thing within 2hrs.15mins. each. ??(Every part of LOTR is over 3&1/2 hrs. long. No one had an issue with it). . *** SPOILERS **THE GOOD :Snape's and Voldemort's characters were played quite well.Throughout the series, Snape has been rather emotionless and monotonous. But, in the pensieve, we see a refreshingly new emotional side of him.Gringott's scene was nicely shown.They added the scene where Hermione & Ron destroy Hufflepuff's cup.They show the future (19 years later) scene. I thought it would be cut.THE BAD : (I have to mention these because I was disappointed as hell)My Biggest Disappointment - Snape's Memories. They showed the whole thing within a minute. They're some of the most interesting & touching scenes of the story. They just rushed through it, even excluding many of the memories. Fred's death. They don't even show it. Then later it was ridiculous to see Mrs. Weasley angry at Bellatrix when the latter was fighting Ginny.The battle was too short and didn't the magnitude and impact as in the book, with Centaurs, Goblins/Kreecher, Hagrid/Spiders, Ghosts, etc.They don't show the Common Rooms. I always imagined it while reading the books. But I badly wanted to see them in the movie.They don't show Harry using the Cruciatus Curse on the one of the Carrows.They wasted time in Nagini's chase.They don't mention about Teddy Lupin and that Harry was his Godfather. They don't mention the names of Harry's other two kids.No mention about the significance of the horcruxes.No mention of Bloody Baron and his link with Ravenclaw's diadem.No mention about how the Invisibility Cloak came into the possession of the Potters, how Harry and Voldemort are related through the Peverell brothers.They don't show how Dumbledore communicated with Snape after he died.Harry doesn't even mend is wand. He directly snaps the Elder Wand into two pieces...In the future scene, all the funny and cheerful dialogues are excluded. Everyone's just smiling and staring at each other. And moreover, none of the them seemed in their late thirties. Didn't the film-makers have enough money to hire good make-up artists.THE UGLY :Dumbledore's Story. He's my most favourite character in the book. There's nothing about him in the movie. They just say he had secrets (what secrets??). They don't even tell the story of Dumbledore sister, Ariana. They don't show him getting emotional at King's Cross.The use of ridiculous one-liners and humourless jokes when the situation is so intense and sad.Harry & Voldemort had their final fight in the middle of nowhere. No one was even around to watch it. (In the book, they were in the middle of the whole crowd.)Bellatrix and Voldemort die bursting into confetti!ALL IN ALL, it wasn't the send-off the series deserved. Someone who has grown up reading the books and watching the movies in the series will understand my woes..."", ""The conclusion to the series hits some of the strongest emotional beats, mainly due to our long-standing connection with the characters, and provides some grand visual treats in the form of extended magical battles. While 'Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows: Part 2 (2011)' may be the biggest in scale and it is entertaining, it does feel lacking in depth - since some things are left oddly unexplained - and instead comes across as an extended third act for its duration. It actually plays out like one long climax, with little of the build-up required to further invest the audience, but at least it's well paced and doesn't hang about. A strong note on which to end a phenomenal series. 8/10"", ""Endings are usually the problems of most movie series. They usually end up being mediocre & unsatisfying or they are made to cash in people. The great thing about Harry Potter movies, the filmmakers are taking their job seriously. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is a great ending of the series. It's more than throwing a lot of action and exposition. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is one of those conclusion that actually care about the series.Deathly Hallows part 1 is just the first and the half of the second act of the story. Deathly Hallows part 2 begins straight forward to its continuation of the last Harry Potter film. And of course, if you haven't seen Deathly Hallows Part 1 or any of the Harry Potter movies, you'll be confused to death. Obvious isn't it? It's pretty clever to make the whole Deathly Hallows story like a slow burn. It started from silent thrills, plans, and escapes to big and loud battles.The series doesn't only end with big and loud action. It also gives us some nostalgia from the old Harry Potter films. And we still get to see more of the characters. The movie itself is pretty exciting. It's a good choice to let David Yates direct the rest of the Potter films because he made this series darker and bolder. Aside from that the film still has its compelling moments like the Prince's Tale scene.No need to tell about the performances of Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson and the rest of the cast because they are obviously good to their characters but there is one actor here is worth mention and that is Alan Rickman. We already knew him as Snape but there is one scene where we see more of his character and his performance was excellent. The filmmaking, the special effects is obviously good. The music score really made the battle scenes epic and perfect for a final film.For me it's really hard to write a review about Harry Potter. Is it because I never read the books or I'm not really a huge fan but in my opinion Harry Potter is a successful series. If I rank all the movie conclusions, this could be number three because nothing beats Lord of the Rings and Star Wars. Either you're a fan or not, you'll love this series. And yes, this is another remarkable movie series."", 'I predict this will be the movie of the year.I was thoroughly immersed in this movie from start to finish and when leaving the cinema (twice in the last 24hours) I could only hear the endless chatter of comments like ""That was great"" and ""Brilliant way to end the series"".Though, in my opinion, some key factors were missing or needed more exploration I think you\'ll find it\'s easy to clue on whether you\'ve read the novels or not. Some previously main characters were lucky to slip in a line or two whilst some of the more minor characters sneaked their way up to the top.The film was brilliantly directed. Music, lighting, script; everything was flawless. Some scenes had my skin crawling and heart racing for absolutely no reason other then the fact that it was utterly eerie, it was hard not to grip the armrests in anticipation.Dramatic musical build up mixed perfectly with lingering silences in all the right places. Spots that would usually host a soft violin were left with the honest and real quiet so that you could wrap your head around everything.My emotions were chewed up and spit out over and over, I didn\'t know whether to grieve, cheer, laugh or scream and neither did the audience I was with.By the end I couldn\'t even think of the fact that it was the end of an era, I couldn\'t even grasp everything that had happened which is why I\'ll be going to see it for the third time within this next week.You wont regret paying for the full experience with this one.', ""OVerall it was okay, and will make a bunch of money. But David Yates was not the best to direct the Potter films. His method always seems to be to just get through the movie as quick as possible. This has been true since OOTP. The problem is that such a quick pace leaves out many key scenes and doesn't allow the viewer to make more of an emotional investment in the story and the characters. Deathly Hallows 2 was no different. It was enjoyable enough, I suppose. But could have been so much better with just an additional 10 minutes of movie. A few additional scenes and extending a few of them just a little more could have added greater depth and emotion.Spoiler alert: Just some scenes that could have been added or extended: Snapes memories- a few more scenes to greater establish his closeness with Lilly and his role in fighting Voldemort. It would have helped to explain why Harry named one of his kids after a man he had hated for 7 years. And a few more lines to show his reluctance to have to be the one to kill Dumbledore. This would have shown Snapes greater respect and love for him.Slightly extend the scene leading up to Mrs. Weasley fighting Belatrix. A few more seconds to establish Jinny's peril in the fight before Mrs. Weasly stepping in and uttering her great line. IT happened so fast, you could miss that Jinny was even fighting Belatrix if you blink at the wrong time.SHould have shown the death of Fred and Percy's reuniting with the family. This wouldn't have taken very long and Fred deserved to have his death scene, rather than just being an afterthought body on a stretcher.SHould have shown a few more individual fight sequences, especially with Hagrid. I was beginning to wonder if Hagrid was even going to appear. And there was no emotion from him when he thought Harry was dead.Extend the scene of Mrs. Malfoy and Harry to better explain why she lied to Voldemort about Harry being dead.Should have shown more entities involved in the fight, like parents, Hogsmead residence, the elves as lead by Kreacher - rather than showing mainly an army of kids fighting the Death Eaters.MOre of the school's teachers in the fight.The final confrontation between Harry and Voldemort could have been done better and stayed truer to the book.OVer all, Yates' Harry Potter movies have been rather emotionless and anti-climatic. DH2, sadly, was no different."", ""I watched Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 and was very pleased with how well it stuck to the book. Because of this, I had high expectations for Part 2. I mean, if you did so well in the first half, you have to do just as well in the second half, right? Right? Wrong.The movie started off very well, starting from exactly where it left off in Part 1 and staying faithful to the book all the way to when Harry and co break into Hogwarts. That's where it starts to go down hill.*Spoilers!* The good: Neville. He was perfectly perfect. I really wish they gave him more screen time because he was adorable.The Gringott's scene. Very well done.The emotion we are shown from Snape. Throughout the series, he's been rather monotonous and emotionless. In the pensieve, we see a different side of him and it is a refreshing change.The battle at Hogwarts. It was intense and wonderfully done.Helena Ravenclaw. It was very emotional and creepy. Although they did not tell us her back story with the Bloody Baron.Rupert Grint and Dan Radcliffe shirtless. That's certainly a plus.OK you know it's bad when I resort to writing about that.The bad: They completely took out the scene where Harry and Luna go into the Ravenclaw Common Room, where they are ambushed by one of the Carrows. It appeared as if they would show it, as I hope they would (I've always wanted to see the other common rooms), but then they don't. Hm.Fred's death scene. Gone. Yup. They show his body once at the end and don't even give you time to grieve before moving on to the next scene. This was an insult to his character's memory.Crabbe's disappeared. Gets replaced by Zabini, and replaced in a different way by Goyle.Snape's memories are rushed and they take out some of the most interesting memories. They just go through a few of them quickly. I've always enjoyed the memories, because you get to see life at Hogwarts through the eyes of someone else for a change, in a different time era.Hermione and Ron battle Nagini, and eventually Neville slays the snake. Eventually. It takes some time getting to that scene.There is not a single mention of Teddy Lupin. That is, until the end when Harry suddenly knows about Lupin's son. Weird, considering Harry was camping in a forest and hadn't heard of any of this.Collin Creevey is replaced by that random Nigel kid.The students are not sent home. No, the teachers think it's OK to just lock the Slytherins in the dungeons and let everybody else stay and fight.Still no mention of the significance of the horcruxes. Hufflepuff's cup is just a plain old cup that Voldy turned into a horcrux.Not enough interaction with characters other than the trio. Too much Harry. It's as if everybody else just have cameos.Random scene where they blow up one of the bridges (ignoring the fact that there are like 2 other bridges that would take them into the school).Voldemort's and Bellatrix's death = explosion into confetti!Percy's on the good side all of a sudden. No explanation at all (a reoccurring theme with Yates, don't you think?).Harry does not fix his old wand with the Elder Wand. No, instead he takes the Elder Wand and SNAPS IT IN HALF. Is that even possible? I didn't think so. So Harry breaks the wand and then chucks it into the abyss. Really Yates, really?All of the fun and cheerful dialogue from the future scene has been resorted to everybody staring and smiling at each other. No explanation once again. They don't even say who's who! Plus there is absolutely no chemistry between Dan and Albus Severus. And it was really awkward to see them all with old make up on.Goodbye Dumbledore's back story! Too many attempts at one-liners and humorless jokes.*End of Spoilers* All in all, all of the personality and charm of the series was zapped away in an attempts to make this final movie is action-packed as possible. It's a shame to see something that you've grown up with, learned to love, taken and twisted into somebody's 'vision.' I mean, why bother adding your own unimportant scenes to the movie, when there are perfectly good ones in the book that you did not bother using at all? There's no...bonding with the characters, no connection with them you felt in Part 1. I did not feel the love for this movie like I had with the book. There was just so much significance that was left out of that movie, and it is such a shame. It had such potential to be a fantastic movie, and it fell short all because of the changes that were unnecessarily made.See the movie, and I'm sure you'll form your own opinion of it. It's not a bad movie, just disappointing and unsatisfying for a die-hard fan who's been following the books for 10 years of their life."", 'An incredible journey that began a decade ago finally arrives at its close with David Yates\' ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II"", as \'The Boy Who Lived\' comes face to face with \'He Who Shall Not Be Named\' in an epic showdown between good and evil. And what a showdown it is- tense, thrilling, breathtaking, and fitting of just about any superlative you can think of. Whereas the first instalment of the \'Deathly Hallows\' emphasised the profound sense of loss and isolation among Harry, Ron and Hermoine, screenwriter Steve Kloves and director Yates leaves behind the moody atmosphere of the previous movie for newfound immediacy and urgency. This is all about that final battle where only one can live, and from start to finish- for once in a Harry Potter movie- the action is swift and relentless.Part II picks up right where the previous film left off- the dark Lord Voldemort smiles in evil triumph as he steals the most powerful wand in the world, i.e. the Elder Wand, from the tomb of beloved Hogwarts headmaster Professor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon). The next shot is equally ominous- students are marched rank-and-file through a Hogwarts courtyard, watched closely by cloaked Dementors hovering over the school grounds. If there was any need of a reminder of the danger facing our three protagonists, these opening sequences should just about refresh one\'s memory of what is at stake.There is precious little time to waste, and the first we get to see Harry, Ron and Hermione, they are already hatching a plan to break into Gringotts to retrieve a Horcrux. Their break-in settles upon a plan of deception that allows for some rare moments of levity in the film, as Helena Bonham Carter gets to ham it up as a polyjuice-disguised Hermoine impersonating Bellatrix Lestrange. This being the first \'Harry Potter\' movie in 3D, Yates caters for some distinctive thrills in the additional dimension with a roller-coaster ride through the vault, culminating in a daring escape on the back of a dragon.But as readers of the book will tell you, the last stand happens back at Hogwarts, and true enough, after this thrilling early set-piece at Gringotts, the trio head back to the School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to confront their foes. It is also where the last Horcruxes are supposed to be, and Harry\'s return to the once sunny and cheery grounds now besieged by darkness and doom becomes a true test of allegiance. Fans will be glad that Kloves gives room for otherwise supporting characters to step into the limelight- in particular, Neville Longbottom (Matthew Lewis) emerges as one of the unlikeliest but also truest heroes on the side of good. The Hogwarts stalwarts also get a chance to show off their magic, and Yates gives each largely enough screen time for the heroic send-off they deserve.Yet he reserves the most emotional moment in the film for Severus Snape\'s (Alan Rickman) vindication, long thought to be the Judas Iscariot-equivalent in the Order and the one who pushed Dumbledore to his death. Yates delivers a truly poignant and deeply heartfelt revelation of Snape\'s true colours, and it is a farewell that even those who have read the book and can expect what is to come will be overwhelmed by its sheer emotional muscle. While Part II was always meant to be an action-packed spectacle, it is to Yates\' credit that there is still as much heart as before in the storytelling.Though brief, this revelation also works brilliantly as a catalyst that propels Harry to come to terms with the sacrifice he has to make. Harry\'s realization of this leads up perfectly to the ultimate duel between him and Voldemort, one that is fierce, ferocious and- thanks to Yates\' imagination- more exhilarating than reading it off the page. The outcome of that battle shouldn\'t be a secret by now, and when the \'happily-ever-after\' coda in Rowling\'s book set 19 years later is also faithfully adapted here, you can\'t quite help but be moved by how it so properly gives the series closure.They are of course no longer kids here- Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson now young adults who have through the film series grown up right under our eyes. While Part I had greater emphasis on Ron and Hermoine, the focus here is squarely on Harry and Radcliffe truly shines in this instalment- his usual understated performance allowing his audience to appreciate the enormities of the challenge before Harry.That we can be so fully immersed in Harry\'s world is testament to the craft of each and every one of the technical team. Production designer Stuart Craig does a masterful job portraying the devastation around Hogwarts, complimented nicely by Eduardo Serra\'s beautiful cinematography and Mark Day\'s skillful editing. Alexandre Desplat\'s evocative score, which combines his own elegiac work with both the John Williams theme as well as Nicholas Hooper\'s mournful composition for the sixth movie, works magic with the visuals. And most deserving of credit is none other than director Yates himself, who has matured movie after movie to deliver a crowning achievement for the series.Pardon us if we have also taken this opportunity to extol the merits of the \'Harry Potter\' franchise- it\'s really hard not to considering how this is the last time we will see the Potter-world in its current incarnation. It is this to which the movie is a farewell to, and it is as beautiful a farewell as it can be, packed with visual spectacle on a scale never before seen in any of the other films and fused with the same powerful emotion as Part I and the Yates films before. All good- even great- things have to come to an end, so there is really no better way to bid adieu than with this grand and glorious final chapter.', 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, part 2 also known as the movie that tore my heart and soul into oblivion. If you thought goosebumps was the criteria for a good scene, then mix those goosebumps with emotional upheaval, coupled with your hands almost shaking and this is Deathly Hallows part 2 in its entirety.Harry, Ron and Hermione are still on the pursuit to collect and destroy Voldemort\'s horcruxes. They believe the next one is hidden away in Bellatrix Lestrange\'s vault in Gringotts, the wizarding bank. But going into the bank is near impossible – unless you know a goblin who worked there, which they do. And so a deal is stricken. At Gringotts, they are discovered to be impostors. Hearts will race as they try to escape with the horcrux and as Harry soon finds out the next one is hidden inside Hogwarts and it\'s something that belongs to another founder of the school. And it is to Hogwarts that he goes. But Hogwarts has changed. Snape is the new headmaster.But there are many things that Harry doesn\'t know, the ultimate secret being one that revolves around his every being. Things are never as it seems. People will show their true colors and they will come out as triumphant even after years of hatred.Dan Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson have done the impossible here. They are possibly the only set of actors that you have seen grow up on the big screen and as the actors grew up on a personal level, they added their maturity to their characters. It\'s very fascinating to watch them interact. Their acting is relentless, captivating and charming as it should be now that they have mastered the characters they\'re playing. You cannot imagine other actors portraying Harry and Ron or another actress to portray Hermione. Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith as Snape and Professor McGonagall respectively gave their all in this movie. You cannot help but be on the edge of your seat whenever any of these two actors are doing their thing. Rickman has a part of the movie entirely dedicated to his character\'s personal story. It is also one of my favorite parts of the book. The Prince\'s Tale is transferred so magnificently on screen that it WILL bring you to tears.Professor McGonagall takes a stand – several, actually – in Deathly Hallows as well. She stands up for a Harry and when she does, the whole theater will explode in applause. Maggie Smith fortifying Hogwarts and then cracking a joke to lighten up the mood\x85 Just the way I like it. You cannot but share the pain in Smith\'s eyes as she sees her beloved school crumbling around her, as she sees all the work that they\'ve done go to waste\x85 And what better actor to portray this generation\'s most bad-ass villain than Ralph Fiennes. He gives his character an extra dimension in this movie now that he has the room to spread his wings so to speak, seeing as he\'s one of the movie\'s main pillars. Lord Voldemort is all evil. But in this movie, another side of him shows up: anguish and misery. And yet, there\'s this subtlety to the nuances of the portrayal that make up the overall result to be very epic, indeed.Steve Kloves is the movie\'s screenwriter. He captured the movie\'s essence perfectly. He presented J.K. Rowling\'s work in such a brilliant way that even the slight deviations from the book (and they are very few) do not even matter anymore. He portrays the gravity of the situation to the letter: the deaths, the destruction, the revelations, the build-up\x85. His version of the story is so well done that it would be incredible not to see an Oscar nod (and a win!) for him in the Screenplay category. He added his touch while keeping Rowling\'s magic. Some of the lines from the book are transferred to the movie as they are and for someone who has read the book over and over again, I was ecstatic to hear them on screen. ""Look\x85 at\x85me."" Enough said.Director David Yates has helmed the last four Potter movies and while I had my doubts about him at first (Order of the Phoenix was not exactly great), he more than surpassed my wildest expectations in this. The pace he sets for the movie never dies down. It keeps on building up and up like a beautiful orchestral crescendo. He guides his actors and actresses with confidence. He\'s working with a marvelous script based on a terrific book. And he has the green light to give it all out. What do you expect from a very talented director with those options? Something not less than magical.Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2 provides you with a sense of catharsis as it ends. It lets your senses go. It lowers your inhibitions more than alcohol. You cannot help but see your hands automatically clap at some points in the movie. You shout in desperation without even controlling your voice and you root for your characters like they\'re really in front of you. Tears flow down your face without any power of you to stop them. There isn\'t any better way to end the epic series that was Harry Potter. If only it weren\'t ending', 'I don\'t know what I was expecting... To be honest apart from the first HP movie... every single one of the following movies has left out major plot points, characters and story lines. I guess I figured that was mainly because the movies only have a certain length of time to tell the story. Thus it was natural for me to assume that with 5+ hours they would be able to include everything in the one book... I assumed wrongly.First off - Do not see this in 3D... The 3D is an after thought and literally added nothing to the experience. The only scene that was 3D that stands out in memory was the death of Voldemort and his confetti explosion.What did they get right? Well its hard to say really.. I was really disappointed with the pacing for the first half of the 2nd part. It felt slow and weird and anti-climatic the entire way. The bank scene and special effects seems average and low budget for a franchise with such high profits. The acting from everyone doesn\'t quite do the job. Snapes ""redemption"" scene was acted out really poorly by Alan Rickman.. which is a shame because I was really looking forward to it as it\'s one of the more moving parts in the series. The only scene that felt like it mirrored the book accurately was the Kings Cross section (apart from Harry having clothes on...) My main gripe with the movie is that they left out so much considering they had two movies to cover it. Harry telling Neville to kill the snake and thus Neville having and important role in the ending of the war <- This part was the ONE part I was looking forward to when Neville pulls the sword out of the hat and cuts Nagini in two... Yet they changed it to Hermione and Ron battling the snake and Neville coming in as an afterthought... The entire war at the end was missing - Centaurs, Goblins/Kreecher, Hagrid/Aragog and just felt very anti-climatic and also have very poor CGI. The entire point of the Deathly Hallows is missed out with Harry not claiming ownership of the wand and reflecting Voldemorts death spell back onto him, and is replaced with a VERY tame action scene that went for about 10 minutes (its then mentioned as an afterthought by Harry post battle). The scene when Harry confronts Snape was also bizarre and seemed unnecessary... Overall the changes and missing scenes left me feeling very empty.My girlfriend hasn\'t read the books and she enjoyed it.. So I\'m sitting here wondering if the knowledge of the books hampered my enjoyment of it. I have no doubt this film will be hailed a success and will make bazillon dollars, but I can\'t help but feel that another director/team could\'ve handled this a lot truer to the books.', ""Moments after I saw the very first trailer for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, I was crawling with goosebumps and plagued with anxiety. After almost a decade, the franchise was coming to an end. I had already read the book, knew the plotting, and remembered the fates of all the characters, but the trailer left me in a near unfathomable state -- the end was coming, and there was nothing I could do to stop it.Picking up practically the exact moment where the first half of the left off, the film begins with Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) still on the trail for the elusive Horcruxes that make up Voldemort's (Ralph Fiennes) soul. Rather quickly, it becomes apparent that the group will need to travel back to Hogwarts, and it is there that the final battle to determine the fate of the wizarding community, and the world at large, begins.Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is a fitting finale for one of the best and most consistent series of the past decade. It is a simply wondrous spectacle that extends and concludes the story wonderfully. While the story and effects are just as great as always, it is the final battle we have all been waiting for that delivers in spades. It is everything you imagined it would be and more. Splitting the films may still be a debatable decision, but the film is able to stand on its own much the same way the previous part did. It is that good, and that gripping. It may be the shortest Harry Potter film, but it is also the only one that feels like it knows exactly where it wants to navigate itself to with each new scene. Grint, Watson and especially Radcliffe are simply stunning in their performances. They have grown up with these characters, and have gotten progressively stronger as actors with each new film. But here, they have totally immersed themselves into their roles, and the results are nothing short of magical. They are exactly how you remember them written in the book, and move from sadness, to courageous, to fearful, and more, with such passion and conviction that you forget they are simply acting. Their styles are that strong, and help provide the emotional crux the film leans on and never from. Even with their varying screen times, the supporting cast is impeccable as always. Alan Rickman is spectacular and simply devastating as the devious Professor Snape. Maggie Smith finally gets some real time to shine as Professor McGonagall, as does Julie Walters as Molly Weasley (who gets the greatest line in the film). Jason Isaacs, Helena Bonham Carter, George Harris, Tom Felton, Michael Gambon and Matthew Lewis also perfect their characters, and help deliver awesome performances all around.But the supporting screen time is dominated by Fiennes as Voldemort. When Harry and his friends are not the focal point, Fiennes simply owns everyone. His performance always ranked amongst the best of the series, and he does not let the finale slow him down. He is horrifically evil in his interpretation, and frequently compares to his absolutely and terrifyingly brilliant performance as Amon Goeth in Schindler's List. The fear that courses through the characters' veins at the very sight or mention of his name, courses equally through the audience. Even when he is being darkly hilarious, Fiennes is downright petrifying. He is the stuff that nightmares are made of. His work is just that close to perfect in the role that it gives an almost genuine authenticity that should not come so effortlessly.But like all Harry Potter films however, the cohesive product is not without its faults.My main gripe with the film come out of the sheer fact that because it was split off into two parts, it allowed some of the more useless and careless sections of prose to make it into the film. Much like the extended and excruciatingly long camping trip from the first half, the second half gets dragged down by the addition of standout moments from the book that felt awful the first time you read them, and come off even worse on the screen. I know they are pandering to the audience, and adding just as much as they possibly could to make the film feel complete, but there was a reason so much was cut out of the other books when they made the leap to the big screen. This is the shortest of the saga by a long shot, and the chaotic pace makes it feel like it could have been even shorter had they chopped more out.My other gripe is the 3D. The filmmakers said they did not have the right amount of time to convert the first half properly, so they just scrapped the plans. The movie looked amazing anyway, and I found myself puzzled at what exactly would have been three-dimensional about it about the second part. Save for a scene early on involving a rather badly rendered dragon, there is not much else that takes advantage of the added 3D. The majority of the film just looks and acts normal, never exploring the format, and never giving the audience a reason to care or change their minds on the quickly dying trend. In what feels like a blink of the eye, the Harry Potter film series is over. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 has arrived, and with it, an incredible end to the franchise. It stumbles in some places because of the inane and disappointing prose of the book, but the filmmakers have stayed true to their book and film fans, and delivered a tremendously worthy finale. It is one of the strongest films of the year, and one of the best film finales ever conceived. 8.5/10.(An extended review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com)."", 'Harry Potter\'s saga had many directors; I will not go back again to who was the best (hint; a Mexican guy), but by far Mr. Yates was the worst. Mr. Yates was only interested in make an easy sell PRODUCT. The only reason the first was paced was to fill out two movies with only one book. Now, we are at the end so WHO CARES, let\'s just finish it, get the money and keep going. Clocking barely two hours, it feel rush and incomplete; missing lots of interesting (and even important) parts on one of the richer book of the series. Hermione and Ron do almost nothing; the others even less. Harry gets a lot of screen time but not necessary good scenes. Even the battle at Hogwarts (the only part Mr. Yates seems to be interested ) is a lame copy of ""The Two Towers"" without any kind of emotion. His direction so bad and unimaginative that when most of the characters die; we do not feel anything. In brief; worth seeing to understand how better the book is and because it is the last one; but AVOID any further movies with David Yates as director.', ""I quite luckily got the chance to see this at an early screening on July 7th.First impressions of the film? Brilliant.Director David Yates, who also directed the 5th, 6th and 7th films is back to direct the final. This pleases me because these 3 films are my personal favourites out of the 7 that have come out so far so I think it's fair to say that I was expecting big things from this. I'm very pleased to say that he's pulled it off ending the series in a fast paced, well written final act.The film (in case you're wondering) picks up straight after where Part 1 ended, Voldemort (Ralph Finnes) has the most powerful wand in his possession and he's finally ready to succeed in what he tried to do over 15 years ago. He finally has the power to kill Harry Potter. I won't go into much more detail in what happens as most people will have read the book and I don't want to drop spoilers! Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) need to seek out and destroy Voldemort's remaining Horcruxes. This is the only way that will give them a chance of stopping He Who Must Not Be Named.Their final journey takes them to places we may not have seen recently or remembered, places such as Gringotts Bank in Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade. Along the way they encounter a variety of creatures, both friend and foe from dragons to spiders, death eaters to old friends and of course, the Dark Lord himself. Will Voldemort Succeed? Or will good trump evil? For those who haven't read the book this is your chance to find out.What I especially love about this film and Part 1 is the direction in which they've taken, adding more cheesy lines and (for example in Part 1) that dance sequence. I feel that these small touches bring the films closer to our hearts and help us to connect with the film a lot more. Sure they leave out a lot of information that the books provide but that's the same with all film adaptations! They've got the main story down and where they've deviated from the book it has been for the best. Not everything written down on paper will translate into visually appealing footage.Part 1 to me also felt unfinished (well it was only half the book I suppose!), I mean in the way that it was long and never seemed to climax. Sure at the end of Part 1 Voldemort gets the want he so badly seeks for and leaves then the films ends on a giant cliffhanger. Part 2 definitely adds the rest of that epicness that so many other films have towards the end. It's full of action! I definitely believe that both Part 1 and 2 are best viewed with a short as possible gap in between them. Otherwise it's like watching the first disc from one of the extended editions of The Lord of the Rings and not watching the second disc for another 6 months!This paragraph is about the visuals and 3D. Skip to the final paragraph for final thoughts.Visually the film is stunning from an effects point of view. From the trailer alone you can see that this film has quite a lot of action in it, crumbling buildings, hundreds of spells and lots of fire. Everything looks great, from the wand duals to the dragons it all is fantastic. Also this time around it is being showed in 3D and is the first (and (probably) last!) potter film to be shown in this way. Now I was very sceptical about this, especially since they announced that the films (originally both parts) would be converted from 2D to 3D instead of being natively filmed in 3D. I believe that what they should have done was what they did with Part 1, scrap the 3D. I'm going to say that it's not great, at times it's pretty good, but never great. For the most part it's okay. I'm going to compare it with the last blockbuster film to come out in 3D, Transformers: Dark of the Moon. The 3D effect is not even close to looking as good as what that film (shot in 3D) had. So I'm going to tell you now, 2D is the best dimension to watch this film in. Having said that if you still want to (or have to) see it in 3D by all means do, the 3D doesn't take away anything from the film, but it doesn't add much.I will end by saying that I definitely recommend this film for everyone, especially Potter fans. The ending that many thought could easily be done wrongly has been done right. Then when you think of Part 1 and 2 as the same film I believe that they are easily the best Potter films. This truly is a fitting ending for the boy who lived."", 'SERIOUS SPOILERS INCLUDED ***************************** David Heyman, the Producer of the Harry Potter films, made the single biggest mistake of his career when he decided that the Director of each film would be offered the opportunity to direct the next. Chris Columbus did a great job working with the young inexperienced actors and actresses in the first 2 films. Alfonso Cuarón and Mike Newell did good jobs with the next 2 (I wish Goblet of Fire had been split into 2 films to include many more subplots, but the primary emotional content was maintained). For various reason, each of these three directors stopped.Then David Yates entered the scene and proceeded to dramatically change the feel of the films. For lack of a better word, the ""magic"" was expunged and everything took on a more ""realistic"" look. Films 5 and 6 were terrible compared with the books. I initially blamed 5 on the fact that Steve Kloves did not write the screenplay, but I now know I was wrong.The film of Deathly Hallows, Part I was OK, but it was simply the setup for the emotional second half.I just saw Deathly Hallows, Part II this evening and I was speechless. In addition to adding useless parts to the narrative, critical emotional scenes were eliminated (e.g. final conversation with Dumbledore and the final conversation between Harry and Voldemort/Tom Riddle where Harry gave Voldemort on last chance to find remorse).Yates even managed to suck the life out of one of the most exciting moments in the book, where Molly Weasley intervenes to save Ginny from Bellatrix and yells ""Not my daughter, you bitch!"" In the film, Molly calmly makes this statement as if she is some western gunfighter.The final scene between the 3 main characters (not including the epilogue) had NO life at all.David Yates - shame on you.Thank goodness we will always have the books.', 'Yeah. I came out of the film disappointed. Not feeling like I had a good time.Don\'t get me wrong, it was a good movie. But there are things that brought it down and too many of them for it to be forgivable.1) Dumbledore\'s brother and sister. You know what I mean. Referred to and never followed upon.2) The kiss. Didn\'t happen in the Chamber of Secrets. In fact, did the Chamber scene happen at all? In the book, it happens after Ron expresses concern for the welfare of the elves (in light of Dobby\'s heroic death) in the outbreak of a fire at Hogwarts. Here, it is given to you as a variation of the ""We\'re alive! Let\'s kiss!"" movie cliché\'.3) Fred\'s death should have been on screen. Period.4) The Avada Kedavra curse didn\'t make bodies disintergrate. Until Voldemort (and perhaps Bellatrix, too?). What? 5) The roles of Matthew Lewis and Evanna Lynch (Neville and Luna respectively) were enough to warrant their names as part of the supporting cast. To only see their names in the full cast is scandalous to say the least.(And, yes, I am aware two-time Oscar winner Emma Thompson gets the same treatment. I know she makes two small appearances, but again, she has two bloody Oscars! Either she is very humble or she needs a better agent.) 6) They really should have stuck with the CGI aging. Except for maybe Ginny and Draco, none of them looked like they were 36.', ""We've been to the first session (virtually) of each Harry Potter movie. You expect the movie to never be exactly like a book (when is it EVER?!) but this one really did change a few things that shouldn't have been touched.There was a lot of good work in this movie. Lily, James, Sirius and Remus joining Harry to go into the Forbidden Forest was well kept. The acting was impressive as usual, something one has come to expect from this group. The visual effects were also excellent, and the storyline was well followed up to a point (this is why the movie got 7/10 from the writer); however, when major changes to this occurred, disappointment set in.The lack of use of the Invisibility Cloak (which we all know is one of the most important hallows to possess) by Harry throughout the movie (except for when they are at Gringotts) is puzzling, as he used it extensively to get around Hogwarts so he could manage to obtain the diadem horcrux as well as make his way to Voldemort within the Forbidden Forest. Also, when Harry 'falls' out of Hagrid's arms out in Hogwart's grounds (when all Hell breaks loose due to Nagini's demise) he uses the Cloak to escape and cause panic amongst the Death Eaters.Also, the fact Harry didn't tell Neville it was imperative Nagini needed to be killed, but Hermione instead, diminishes Neville's importance! In the book, it is completely up to Neville to destroy Nagini as he is the only one left who it is thought to be able to. Also, it can be tied into the prophecy that Trelawney made all those years before as Neville killing the final horcrux, causes Voldemorts vulnerability. Thankfully, Neville is the one that kills Nagini, but more by luck than good management.Harry telling Dumbledore that he had nothing to kill Voldemort with (at Kings Cross Station) was not correct, as well, as he went into the Forest with both the Cloak and a wand, which was what made him so special as he did not raise that wand against Voldemort. He instead died willingly, again showing his great strength and love of those important to him - his friends/family at Hogwarts.The adaptation by the screen writer, Steve Kloves, of the final scene between Voldemort and Harry of the novel - well...THAT'S A DISAPPOINTMENT!!! What J.K Rowling wrote was good enough and whenever I've read it I've always loved it and pictured it so clearly in my mind, so the whole battle scene between Harry and Voldemort was ridiculous, and could only occur because they ruined the sequence of events. VERY UNNECESSARY! The wands locking in battle – what the???? That should not have occurred, as they had different cores, different timbers and were nothing like the Twin Core Phenomenon that occurred in book four (Goblet of Fire). You don't even hear Harry say Expelliarmus which had become his 'trademark spell'.Harry, Ron and Hermione not going to the Headmaster's Office after defeating Voldemort, and there getting a standing ovation from all previous Headmasters and Headmistresses, and Harry not mending his phoenix feather core wand through using the Elder Wand (Death Stick) was very much an anticlimax. Instead, Harry (in the company of Ron and Hermione) snaps the Elder Wand (the possibility of which I would think is questionable in the first place!) and chucks it off the bridge (never to be seen again?).It would have been nice to have had the connection between the Dumbledore's and Grindelwald explained, especially Adriana's death. This actually moulded Dumbledore into the man he became - a professor and later Headmaster of Hogwarts; never Minister of Magic; and a supporter of Muggle-born witches and wizards. It also explained how he came into possession of the Elder Wand.I was so glad, and there was applause in the theatre when the epilogue occurred as its lovely to see Albus Severus Potter and the short conversation between him and his father, Harry.Overall, probably not one I will see again at the movies, which is something I have done with the others (though they were disappointments in ways as well!)."", ""I gotta chance to see this movie in 2D (Luckily) since i read the reviews of the 3D being bad . . but after seeing the movie even in 2D and witnessing the end of such an Enormous Mega Series . . i felt this was a very very disappointing end . . the HP Fans Have Been Robbed off their immense trust and money in seeing some modified illogical end to the story ..than what everyone had pictured in the mind after reading the Final Book of deathly hallows(SPOILERS) HP Deathly hallows part 2 was very shallow.

The acting, as usual is sensational and very convincing. Ralph Fiennes does a really amazing job at playing Lord Voldemort as he has done in all the previous movies.Lord Voldemort gets a lot of screen time and you should be please because he is really great.Also as usual, Daniel Radcliffe, Ruper Grint and Emma Watson are great as Harry,Ron and Hermione.Alan Rickman as Severus Snape is the best choice that could be done for the character as he is nearly exactly what i was imagining what he would be like when i read the book. I really do not need to tell you about his acting because its Alan Rickman and as usual he is fabulous. Michael Gambon is, as usual, a great Albus Dumbledore.Maggie Smith does a very very good Prof McGonagall...well you will have to see the movie to know what i mean but i am pretty sure you will like everything she does ! The film takes quite a few liberties from the book but to be honest, thats fine with me..one of the prime examples is the scene in the trailer where Harry and Lord Voldemort seem to hug and jump of a roof. In the trailer it looked odd and out of place but in the movie it looks pretty good and a lot less odd.The Battle for Hogwarts takes up about half the movie and is pretty spectacular and on a pretty large scale..well as spectacular as a PG-13 can be..there are so many explosions and things going on at the same time and it is just pure chaos,as the book intended i am sure, and its plain old fun to watch.Quite a few things happen in the battle that do not happen in the book but to be honest thats fine...doing a 100 percent adaptation would be a tough task and might not be as fun to watch.The movie does a great job, as the others did, at being funny seconds after a emotionally charged scene..and there are a lot of them ! I heard quite a bit of crying in all the moments you can imagine (if you have read the books) and also a lot of laughing.The special effects where very impressive, and well made if not a little over used.My only main problem with the movie is it did not need to be 3D.quite a few of the effects where clearly just to say look at me i am 3D !! It just did not feel needed. The sense of danger that Harry and crew face is very real and the director did a great job at making sure you are kept on your toes.The film is definitely the darkest in the saga so far and has quite a few intense scenes..Knowing how uptight censors can be its good that it gets away with a PG-13..I am trying to do the review without giving away too much because i am not keen on giving spoilers away at all but if you have any questions just ask and i will do my best to answer them. If you are a hardcore Harry Potter fan, you will most likely love it and it will be a whole bunch of fun.if you hate changes being made to the book chances are you will not love it so much...It may have a couple of flaws, which i am going to address below, but other than that its what it should be; a whole bunch of fun and a pretty good send of (or is it the end?) for the saga.The final scene is sweet and in all a good ending. When i left the theater it felt quite surreal as i have been nearly growing up with the Harry Potter saga, and it made me sad to know it was over..or as David Hayman said in the speech he gave before the movie, The end is just the beginning.My final thoughts on it are that its a pretty amazing end to a pretty amazing saga. (i am trying to improve my reviews little by little)', ""There are an awful lot of reviews talking about how this film is 'the best yet' and how it 'ticks all the boxes' or is 'a must for fans'. It is none of these!7 years ago I walked out of watching the 3rd film cursing and swearing out loud about how poor the conversion of book to film had been done. Scenes dropped and changed for 'time considerations' whilst others were invented and thrust in- all creating plot holes that did not exist in the novel. This time I walked out praying that I live long enough to see someone take the books and redo the ENTIRE series properly, using the obvious failures done in the films to date as a road map for improvement.**SPOILERS**It is, unfortunately, near impossible to give a proper review of this film without including at least some spoilers. Whilst one can make generic statements such as 'divergence from source material is too great', 'plot holes cause a lack of integrity' and 'over editing leads to a lack of connection to the characters' none of it means too much without going into at least a little detail.Simple things such as not showing the death of Fred, despite having gone into George's injury so well in part 1, or the massively powerful and indestructible Elder Wand being snapped in half with little to no effort whatsoever are good examples. Bellatrix's wand was more durable for god's sake!Meanwhile, having just spent an entire previous film searching for Horcruxes they suddenly jump from finding one in the form of a cup based on logical deduction to guessing where the next one is on what appears to be a whim. For the sake of taking 90 seconds of screen time to mention that the ring was Slytherin's and the goblet was Hufflepuff's, and it would seem logical for Voldemort's ego to have a desire to stamp his dark magic on a legendary item for each of the 4 founders- therefore Ravenclaw would be a good place to look next- instead Yate's goes and has the characters make a crazy leap of logic for which they need to endanger their lives with no apparent reason behind it whatsoever. This is storytelling of the lowest calibre!These things aren't just failures to adapt the book correctly when to do so would have been better than making alteration, they are basic failures of storytelling that any student on a film or writing course would have lost marks on if it were an assignment. These plot holes, discontinuities, omissions and alienations are in such great number that if it were an assignment it would, in fact, have been lucky to scrape through with a D as a result!No doubt we will see the score of this film drop over time as more and more people- particularly on 2nd watching, or seeing it for the first time on an average size TV or ten years from now when special effects technology has moved on- find the imagery far less awe inspiring than the films flaws. At that point the realisation will kick in that this is actually a very poor rendition of the source material that almost any hack director could have put out just as well if not better with the budget and cast/crew available to hand."", 'Elder Wand works despite cracking??? What is going on in this film??? Humor was placed at inappropriate times. It was supposed to be a hard, intense, fast-paced, all-out action, battle-hard, World War 2-kind of film, but this is anything but. Those who are in need of a good laugh might enjoy this film. Rowling\'s wizarding laws are completely decimated. Since when did Harry start \'sensing\' horcruxes? Did Harry even possess this ability to \'sense\' horcruxes to begin with? In that case, why didn\'t he realize that the diary in \'Chamber of Secrets\' is a horcrux, and Slytherin\'s locket and Nagini in \'Deathly Hallows Part 1\' are also horcruxes? In such as a situation, the trio would\'ve been totally spared the trouble of wandering around like nomads (searching for the remaining horcruxes) like they did in Part 1. It doesn\'t even work that way. But then the previous adaptations were so horribly created (if you can call them adaptations, that is) that the film-makers had to tie up the loose ends somehow, and the end result is there for everybody to see. Oh yeah, Bellatrix and Voldemort burst and erupt like confetti when they die. And after Harry kills Voldemort, no one even cares two hoots about what has happened. They are all behaving as if Voldemort never even existed in the first place, drinking tea in the Great Hall (not even a ""Well done, Harry""). In that case, why did they even fear to speak his name for all these years?I am a fan of Rowling\'s writing. But the films have never lived up to that standard. And this one, I\'m afraid, is no different.', 'After burying Dobby at the garden of the Shell cottage, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) convinces\nGriphook (Warwick Davis) to help them get to Lestrange\'s vault in Gringotts, to retrieve\none of Voldemort\'s Horcruxes in exchange for Godric Gryffindor\'s Sword.\nMeanwhile, Ollivander (John Hurt), the Wandmaker warns Harry that he won\'t stand a chance\nwith Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) who has the Elder Wand. They arrived in Gringotts, Hermione (Emma Watson) disguised as Bellatrix (Helena Bonham Carter), using a Polyjuice Potion, Ron (Rupert Grint) disguised as a random wizard while Harry and Griphook go under the Invisibility Cloak. With the help of Imperius curse, they manage to get to the carts that take them down to the vaults, but when\ntheir cover is blown, Gringotts security attacks them. They manage to get to Lestrange\'s vault and find the Horcrux, Helga Hufflepuff\'s Cup, at which Griphook betrays them and flees with the sword yelling ""Thieves! Thieves!"" Harry grabs the Horcrux and the trio escape using a captive dragon. As they swim ashore of a lake, after jumping off the dragon, Harry has a vision about Voldemort receiving the news that the Horcrux was stolen. Harry sees that Voldemort is angry and scared. Voldemort kills the goblins, including Griphook, that bring him the news. Harry also sees that the next Horcrux is related to Rowena Ravenclaw, and is in Hogwarts castle.The three Apparate to Hogsmeade in hopes of sneaking into the school but a Caterwauling charm is set off that warns the Death Eaters of the trio\'s arrival. They are saved by Aberforth Dumbledore (Ciarán Hinds),\nAlbus\'s brother, who Harry has seen through the mirror that he has. The trio use a passageway to Hogwarts\nprovided by Aberforth, with Neville Longbottom (Matthew Lewis) leading the way. The group arrives\nat the Room of Requirement where Dumbledore\'s Army made a resistance from Snape\'s regime. As headmaster, Snape (Alan Rickman) has turned Hogwarts into a lifeless prison. Harry confronts him in front of the entire school by saying, ""How dare you stand where he stood. Tell them how it happened that night. How you looked him in the eye, a man who trusted you, and killed him"" (referring to Albus Dumbledore). Minerva McGonagall (Maggie Smith) intervenes and fights Severus, who flees to his master. Meanwhile, Voldemort has summoned his army and surrounds Hogwarts.McGonagall and the other Hogwarts staff made a barrier to keep the school safe from any attack. Hermione and Ron go to the Chamber of Secrets to get a basilisk fang (which can destroy Horcruxes), destroy Hufflepuff\'s Cup, and abruptly kiss. Harry, with the help of Rowena Ravenclaw\'s ghost daughter, Helena, finds out that the Ravenclaw Diadem was hidden, by Voldemort, in the Room of Requirement. He goes there, but is confronted by Malfoy and friends. When one of Malfoy\'s cohorts creates an unstoppable fire (and perishes due to it), Harry, Ron and Hermione rush to escape on brooms. They save Malfoy (Tom Felton) and his other friend on the way. They destroy the diadem using a basilisk fang. Voldemort uses the Elder Wand to destroy the shield around Hogwarts.Voldemort and Snape then meet in the boat house, where Voldemort tells Snape that the Elder Wand is not truly his, because he is not the master of it; that Snape is the master of the wand because Snape killed Dumbledore, the previous master. So, Voldemort attacks Snape, and then orders Nagini to kill him.Meanwhile, Harry had been looking into Voldemort\'s mind to see where he was, and so knew that he was in the boathouse. Harry, Ron and Hermione witness all of this, and when Voldemort disapparates, go into the boathouse. Snape cries a tear of memories, and comments on how Harry has his mother\'s eyes, and dies.Voldemort then speaks into the minds of every person in the area. He commands his forces to retreat so that the fighters at Hogwarts can dispose of their dead with dignity. He then tells Harry that, unless he gives himself up in the Forbidden Forest, Voldemort will kill everyone who stands in his way.Harry, Ron, and Hermione go back to the castle and find that Lupin (David Thewlis), Tonks (Natalia Tena), and Fred (James Phelps) have all died. Harry goes to the Headmaster\'s office, where he uses the Pensieve to view Snape\'s memories. Harry learns that Snape has been on the good side ever since Voldemort decided to kill Lily Potter (Harry\'s mother). Snape loved Lily almost his entire life, and promised to do anything for Dumbledore as long as he protected her. Then, when she was murdered, Snape promised to protect Harry in her place. We learn that Dumbledore had told Snape to kill him, as he would die soon anyway. We then learn that Harry is a Horcrux. Voldemort accidentally created one that fateful night at Godric\'s Hollow. For this reason, Harry must die.Harry then goes to the Forbidden Forest and opens the snitch (by saying I am ready to die). The\nResurrection Stone appears inside the snitch, and Harry uses it to bring back his deceased loved ones. Harry faces Voldemort who uses the killing curse to kill Harry.Harry wakes up and talks with Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) in a \'heaven-like"" place. They talk a little, and Dumbledore says that Voldemort actually killed the bit of his soul that was in Harry, and not Harry himself. So, Harry decides to go back to the Forbidden Forest (his body was always there, but his consciousness was not).Voldemort has Narcissa Malfoy (Helen McCrory) check if Harry is alive. When she reaches Harry, she finds that he is alive, and asks Harry quietly if Draco is still alive. Harry nods, and she pronounces him dead.Believing that he is truly dead, Voldemort\'s army marches down to the defenseless Hogwarts while Harry is being carried by the tied Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane). Voldemort torments the students and staff as they are now vulnerable and he\'s ready for anyone who wants to join him. Neville then gives a moving speech in which he says that although Harry is dead, the fight is not over. He then gets the sword of Gryffindor from the sorting hat. Harry reveals himself to be alive and casts a spell to Voldemort and his army. Many of the other Death Eaters flee, including the Malfoy family. Battle ensues inside the castle, and Harry and Voldemort face off and continuously cast spells at each other. On the other hand, Hermione and Ron try to kill the last Horcrux, Nagini. However, they fail to do so. However, when the snake is about to kill them, Neville kills it by decapitating its head using the sword of Gryffindor.Harry and Voldemort cast spells at each other, and Voldemort\'s killing curse backfires, and kills him, as the Elder wand flies to Harry. Harry explains to Ron and Hermione that Draco was master of the wand, not Snape, because Draco disarmed Dumbledore before Snape killed him. Then, at Malfoy Manor, Harry disarmed Draco, making Harry the true master of the wand. Harry then snaps the wand in two, and throws it away forever.19 years later, Harry and Ginny (Bonnie Wright) are now parents and are guiding Albus Severus Potter and their other children into platform 9 3/4. When Albus is nervous about being sorted into Slytherin, Harry reveals to him that the sorting hat will take your opinion into account. The Potters meet up with Ron and Hermione (who are married) who then watch as their kids ride away on Hogwarts express.']"
62,Wizarding World,Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,3183660,"[""It's a letdown. The fun and charming bits of Harry Potter were left out of this film. I like J.K. Rowling's work immensely, so that's hard to say.Plot-wise, things are a mess. Newt and his luggage full of magical creatures are a side plot to the important things going on. The real story is that an auror in New York is searching for a powerful and dangerous magical force that manifests within a teenager. His plan: turn the destructive energy the teenager carries into a weapon, I assume. Enter Newt Scamander, who is trying to transport a thunderbird(?) to Arizona for release back into the wild. Some of Newt's other creatures escape in New York, and he has to round them up, all while becoming entangled with the auror and his teenage target.The plot sounds sort of okay, but it's not well integrated. The characters don't add up to much of anything, either. The sidekick baker is fairly likable, though, along with his brewing romance with Queenie. Newt's a bit thin as a character. Eddie Redmayne's dialog also tended to come out mumbled, which made him hard to understand at times. Throw in a few acronyms and oddball words like MACUSA, and that makes for more confusion.Altogether, the film needed more work to tighten the story lines and make Fantastic Beasts a story focused on Newt and his menagerie, instead of what we ended up with."", ""I really want to draw attention to the title of the review above. I'm sure many die-hard potterheads would want every review on this site to score this movie 10/10 and say it is a masterpiece. Well I can't do that, since that isn't my honest opinion. What I can say though is that Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a thoroughly entertaining affair that is well worth a watch, especially if you're a fan of J.K. Rowling's magical world. For starters the cast was great. Eddie Redmayne feels perfectly cast in main role as Newt Scamander. A very awkward and introverted person who prefers the company of animals rather than humans. He has the quirkyness down to a tee. I also really liked the muggle (or no-maj as the Americans call him) played by Dan Fogler. How he reacts to the whole wizarding world and the events that happen around him is actually really funny. I also thought Katherine Waterstone and Alison Sodul did great playing two sisters who wind up roped in to the whole adventure. The creatures are the best part of the entire movie by far. They CGI on them looks kind of fake, but it's more than made up for by the concepts alone. Almost all of them have some clever twerk that keep them from feeling generic and they're all filled with personality. The sequences when they're catching these creatures are all really fun to watch. However there are some problems with this movie. For one it has way too many side characters. A lot of them feel completely underdeveloped and add basically nothing to the overall story (*cough* Jon Voight *cough*). There's also a magical threat that becomes more central towards the end but it honestly kind of left me scratching my head. I just wasn't that engaged in that part of the story to be honest. Still these problems are not enough to ruin the movie by any means. It's filled with wonder and creativity and being back in the world of witchcraft and wizardry is worth the price of admission alone. I enjoyed the characters, the humour and the creatures a whole lot. I also want to give J.K. Rowling huge credit for not just rehashing the Harry Potter story again. This is fresh and new and while it isn't flawless by any means it's certainly entertaining!"", 'I have to say that I am really disappointed of the movie as a whole. The Harry Potter movies are easily one of the best and most rewatchable movie franchises so far. And this movie is sadly nothing like the original HP movies. The only thing that is has in common are the special effects (for the apparitions). There was no real dialogue between the characters. Just silly one-liners and the occasional humorous remark. I am also very angered by the fact that they just introduced a new concept (obscurials) to the HP franchise that would literally change everything (if obscurials exist why hasn\'t Harry Potter become one? After all he fits the criteria).There was also way too much CGI in the movie. It became a real nuisance after a while. Especially because it wasn\'t even ""up to today\'s standards"".My final critique concerns the overall flair of the movie. It just didn\'t feel like it belongs to the magnum opus that is the HP movie franchise. And righteously so; why did they film it in NYC? The HP franchise is the most British thing since James Bond and Doctor Who. I never really realized it before but now that I watched this movie it became very clear to me. You can\'t just change the location like this and expect the audience to embrace it. Sorry. What\'s next? Fantastic Beasts in Japan? No thanks. We already have that, it\'s called Kaiju.', 'Not being a fan of the universe that Rowling created and not much of a fan of ""Harry Potter"" as such, then I had very little interest in watching ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" actually, but I had the chance and went to watch it with my wife.And while she found it to be a good movie and enjoyed it, then I was in the opposite side. I didn\'t enjoy ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" one bit.Sure this movie was amazingly great and astounding to look at visually. And believe you me that there was not spared on the special effects and the visuals in this movie. The CGI effects in ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" was off the charts. And that alone is almost enough to make it worthwhile to watch the movie, almost...What deterred me was how the was the amazingly boring storyline. It took forever for nothing to happen, and that was a massive anchor around the movie, dragging it down to the point where it became unbearable to witness.It seemed like the entire movie was just a stream of random scenes put together, in no particular order, for making a complete movie. There was a disturbing lack of a red thread throughout the course of this movie.As for the acting, well they surely had managed to get some great names and talents along for the ride, but the pick for the lead role was a bit beyond my comprehension, because Eddie Redmayne seemed to be as lost in the story as the rest of the audience. He stuck out like a sore thumb among the likes of Colin Farrell and Dan Fogler.I walked out on the movie shortly after 50 minutes into the movie, when the main character started to do a mating dance. That was just the pinnacle of ridiculousness and I tossed the towel in the ring at that point. It was just too much.I am sure that there definitely is a massive fan flock for this movie, given the success of the ""Harry Potter"" movies (and books), however it was just a swing and a miss for my part.', ""How do you make a 'Harry Potter' movie without Harry Potter? Before the last of the eight films of J.K. Rowling's staggeringly popular universe five years ago, that must have been the conundrum facing Warner Brothers executives as they stared at the end of the line of their most lucrative franchise. And yet thanks to Rowling herself as well as series stalwart David Yates, there is once again new life to be found in the world of witchcraft and wizardry that she had dreamt up in the seven books of the boy wonder. The inspiration is one of Harry's textbooks at Hogwarts, an essential text which served as a guide to magical animals written by one Newt Scamander. Rowling had written it into a companion piece in 2001, but as those who had read the 128- page book will tell you, there is a lot more that Rowling must have had to add to her first movie script even as an adaptation of that earlier book.That explains why the film's narrative feels like two parallel story lines, both of which are set in the 1920s in New York City. The first (and the one more obviously drawn from her text) concerns the magizoologist and former Hogwarts student's (Eddie Redmayne) arrival with a suitcase of magical creatures in tow. He's here to do field work for the titular book that he's writing, but no thanks to a mix- up involving a klutzy working-class 'no-maj' (meaning 'muggle' or ordinary, non-magical human) named Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler), some of the beasts Newt keeps hidden in his suitcase – which is really a magical device enclosing a massive nature preserve – have escaped. Together with two comely female wizards, the struggling investigator Porpentina Goldstein (Katherine Waterson) and her mind-reading sister Queenie (Alison Sudol), Newt and Jacob set out to chase down these creatures before they wreak more havoc on the city.And yet their blithe adventure could not have taken place in a more complicated time – not only has the Magical Congress of the United States (or MACUSA in short) set out strict rules against the revelation of the existence of wizards and/or the wizarding world, its meticulously cautious Madam President (Carmen Ejojo) has outlawed the possession of all beasts. There is perhaps good reason though – the city is torn by a mysterious force purportedly to be that of an Obscurus, a dark and uncontrollable power manifested by wizards who have repressed (rather than being taught to control) their innate powers. Rounding out the second, and much darker, story is a missing dark wizard called Gellert Grindelward (Johnny Depp), which the opening prologue via numerous newspaper reels informs us has gone underground since his dark doings in Europe. It's no secret that Grindelward and by extension, Depp, whom we see only briefly at the end of the movie, will take up much of the acreage of the four other 'Fantastic Beasts' films that Yates and Rowling have planned. Given how this needs to set the stage for the beginning of a new franchise, there is understandably yards of exposition and a lot of introductions to do within the just-over two hours it has. It also means that, aside from its city-shaking cataclysm of a climax, this is pretty much like an origin story, such that like the first 'Harry Potter' movie, one gets the distinct sense that it is holding back for bigger and hopefully even more intriguing things down the road.Not to say that this first of a quintet isn't charming in and of itself; oh no, in fact, we are confident that Potter fans and newcomers alike will find much to love and beguile of the rich and fascinating fictional world that Rowling has created. Indeed, there is sheer delight in discovering the menagerie of creatures that Newt has hidden in his briefcase – among them a scene-stealing platypus with a penchant for stealing shiny things, a majestic avian which changes shape and size to fill any available space, and a tiny stick-like green insect that can pick locks. Before things get serious, the early scenes with Newt and his unlikely companions pop with escapist fun, not least when he and Jacob get caught in incriminating situations by law enforcement while pursuing their small, furry and oh-so-cute kleptomaniac around bank vaults and jewelry stores. It is also here that we get to savour more fully the effortlessly endearing Redmayne and Fogler, one quirkily adorable as the shy and slightly awkward boy-man and the other an unassuming bumbler whose wide-eyed wonder upon the world previously hidden from his eyes channels our very own.Like how she did with Harry, Ron and Hermoine, Rowling gets a strong character dynamic going around the four cohorts, including a budding attraction between Newt and his Auror-turned-ally Tina as well as a gentle romance between Jacob and Queenie. It is these characters that anchor the busy plotting in the second hour with heartfelt emotion. Even so, the beautifully ornate production design shines through every frame, whether a seedy underground jazz club with all manner of peculiar (if slightly grotesque) creatures to Manhattan's old City Hall subway station where the climax unfolds. The special effects are equally stellar, particularly the transition from our world to that inside the suitcase and a breathtaking scene where the Obscurus wrecks destruction across several of New York's skyscrapers before plunging into the City Hall station. And of course, the close-ups of the various beasts are just as visually stunning, some scary, some cuddly, some ethereal and some just downright goofy. Even without the appeal of adorable young children, 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them' is pure enchantment, perfectly setting the stage for a whole new chapter of the wizarding world we've come to embrace through the 'Harry Potter' films. To call it fantastic may be slightly hyperbolic, but you'll be glad to know it doesn't fall too far short."", 'Perhaps the biggest dilemma you will have before going into this, is whether or not it will live up to the legend of Harry Potter. As someone who loved the series and was skeptical about Yates undertaking this endeavor, I am pleased to say that I\'m relieved, As Yates delivers a refreshing and whimsical film. Sure, it doesn\'t have the characters we\'ve come to love, but with the creatures you encounter and with the added humor of J.K Rowling, you will come to grip with the fact that this movie will leave an impression.Newt is a scientist who has an uncanny resemblance to Doctor Who, as his strange and cunning outlook bares the trademarks of the epic character. Newt is searching for unorthodox creatures. As he stuffs them into his suitcase which is an accident waiting to happen. The suitcase seems to be unhinged and dire need of a proper lock. As he arrives in New York he mixes his bag with Jacob Kowalski, who lets loose beasts that start to run rampant in the streets. J.K. Rowling\'s first outing as a screenwriter is a wild success, with her keen eye for detail and whimsical taste. ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" becomes a fine addition to her epic saga. I\'m glad that there are four more awaiting us because if Rowling proved anything, it\'s that she has a lot more to offer.', 'When they have nothing to say and no message to deliver, but they still want to make a movie, they are resorting to special effects. Special effects over special effects. Nothing matters anymore, the story, the actors, the direction, nothing at all. The music in this kind of films is always the same, it seems to be a carbon copy. Poor Jon Voight, what a huge distance from ""Midnight Cowboy"", ""Coming Home"", and ""Runaway Train"" (all three absolute masterpieces), and his next films (culminating with this s..t). Poor Colin Farrell, also a very good actor himself (but not here, here everything is bad). Poor cinematographer Philippe Rousselot, what he came to do... (he\'s the one who signed in the past the cinematography to masterpieces like ""Diva"", ""The Moon in the Gutter"", ""The Emerald Forest"", ""The Bear"", ""Dangerous Liaisons"", ""Henry & June""). Mr. Director David Yates is an expert in stupidity, he\'s making only poop-movies. Only one thing I liked in this huge mess: the pastries in the shape of fantastic beasts offered by Kowalski (Dan Fogler) in his shop at the end of the film.', 'David Yates has done it again - what a terrible movie. Boring from beginning to end. J.K. Rowling just wasn\'t able to write a script that could live up to the Harry Potter books and universe. Fantastic? Not so much. Beasts? Sure, lots of them, but uninteresting. Where to find them? All inside a magical bag. There\'s absolutely no character development: we get to know very little about Newt Scamander, his personal quest, his thoughts or what drives him; Tina is just bland; and Kowalski is a comic relief that just wasn\'t necessary. Throughout the movie, you never understand why Newt has a ""Noah complex"" or why he was driven to build his own Ark of magical creatures; there\'s no tension, no drama involved - muggles don\'t know about those creatures, so they can\'t hate them or understand how dangerous they might be, and wizards just don\'t seem to care enough about them. Why exactly was Newt expelled from Hogwarts? What exactly was his relation to Leta Lestrange? We just don\'t know. Graves was an interesting character, but very poorly developed. Sure, he is revealed to be something more and we couldn\'t know too much, but we never get to understand the context in which he professes his ideology. For a movie that revolves around magic, there\'s actually not that much magic being used during the movie. Maybe next time they should try a movie with less special effects and a little bit more acting. The Harry Potter books were always about the narrative - well written, enticing, thrilling, focused on big existential issues, such as death, the quest for immortality, friendship. This movie was about the visual power of cinema, and that just isn\'t enough. Besides, a whole generation grew up with Harry Potter, a generation that actually ""grew up"", so a PG movie won\'t work.', ""FANTASTIC BEASTS AND WHERE TO FIND THEM is the latest instalment in the cash cow HARRY POTTER franchise and a total disappointment as a movie. I didn't expect much when I saw that artificial director David Yates, responsible for the shallowest movies in the Harry Potter film series as well as the awful LEGEND OF TARZAN, was at the helm, but Rowling's first-ever script promised something; it turns out she's a far worse scriptwriter than she is a novelist.This plays out as a prequel to Potter, with Eddie Redmayne - adopting a single gormless expression of wonder from beginning to end - on the hunt for various escaping magical creatures in 1920s New York. There's no plot at all, just endless chase scenes involving poorly animated CGI beasties, so the supporting cast have nothing to do expect add perfunctory romance/comedy/drama, none of which works. The CGI is blatant and used to drive the narrative, which it can't do, so by the time of the umpteenth magical battle you simply don't care. And they're making another four of these? Give me strength!"", ""It's OK, I suppose.Good parts: Period costumes & sets were beautiful. Special effects were (mostly) very good, and the Fantastic Beasts were individually great fun.So-so parts: The acting was only OK. Newt (Eddie Redmayne) in particular left me dissatisfied. Yes he's playing an introverted character, but I saw no reason for the bond he seemed to build with Tina. The MACUSA wizards & witches were extremely underdeveloped, including the President. Their hot-and-cold treatment of Tina for her interruptions made no sense to me either.Poor: The editing seemed off to me, in a way I haven't noticed since The Chamber of Secrets. --- awkward pauses littered the film, robbing it of its momentum. Newt's interaction with some of the larger beasts didn't look realistic (e.g. his stroking the Thunderbird's neck). And I personally dislike FX-heavy movies where the Big Bad is some amorphous cloud (not as bad as Green Lantern, but pretty bad).Final thought: why do so many large beasts have bird's heads? This seems to be a thing with Rowling ..."", ""I admit walking into the theater, I was very excited but also a little apprehensive. I should not have worried at all though, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them was incredibly enjoyable! Rowling's magical world is as alluring and fun as ever! For me, the best thing about this movie is exactly that. Exploring this world.In the Harry Potter saga, with the exception of Deathly Hallows, most of the action was confined in Hogwarts. When we were taken out of the school, the main characters, being underage, were not allowed to do magic. The novelty in this movie is that we get to follow a fully fledged adult wizard in an entirely new environment and observe the dynamics and workings of the magical society.Said wizard is Newt Scamander, a magical zoologist that traveled the world in order to find and document rare creatures, which he carries in his magical suitcase. When this suitcase gets mixed up with one that belongs to muggle Jacob, some of Newt's creatures escape and cause problems in New York.Eddie Redmayne shines in this movie. He plays a very clearly British, endearing and slightly awkward Newt, but the character's kindness is obvious by the loving and friendly way that he treats his magical creatures. Dan Fogler does a great job as Jacob Kowalski, the muggle who is suddenly thrown into a world of wonder that existed beside him all along. He is the one the audience can best relate to, since he mirrors our sense of marvel. Katherine Waterstone and Alison Sudol also do a good job as the two vastly different magical sisters, who aid Newt in his adventure. If I had a small gripe, it would be that the excellent Colin Farell was in my opinion under used.All in all, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a solid and visually stunning movie that manages to achieve three things.First, although it takes place in the Harry Potter universe, it stands apart and has its very own story, which can be enjoyed separately from that of the famous young wizard. Second, it drops quite a few hints and names, which not only tie in nicely with the stories that we know, but also serve to set up the next installments, which are rumored to document Dumbledore's past and connection with Grindelwald. Finally, the movie features a bustling 1926 New York, which coupled with the intriguing character dynamics, offers a brand new insight into Rowling magical world and leaves us poor muggles asking for more.After following Harry's adventures, many of us were left wanting to see much more of the story and luckily for us, it seems Rowling has that much more to offer. Personally, I can't wait for the next movie, great job!"", ""The magical community in Britain has been fleshed out rather well through the seven Harry Potter books and the eight films that followed, but America's magic users have been pretty much overlooked.Until now.The year is 1926. In the midst of the dark wizard Grindelwald wreaking havoc in Europe, an unassuming man travels to New York City with a case full of, well, fantastic beasts ( a case which goes full TARDIS, as well). There's also an unknown magical threat tearing up streets and striking fear in the hearts of the nomaj (non-magical, US term for muggle) community. The Magical Congress of the United States is searching for the culprit, and who do they blame? The unassuming man, Newt Scamander, a role that Eddie Redmayne fits into perfectly.With the help of Tina Goldstein, a disgraced Auror, and Jacob Kowalski, a nomaj who gets caught up in Scamander's creature exploits, they must clear Scamander's name and find out who is behind the attacks in New York and stop them.This film has a lot going for it, but it really holds up as an installment of the Harry Potter franchise in the way that it showcases the allure of the universe without the old story of The Boy Who Lived. It is also buoyed by great visual effects and witty banter throughout.This will prove to be just the first of possibly many films in the Harry Potter universe (and yes, Johnny Depp does show up as Grindelwald), and if this film is any indicator of the wonder this universe instills, I can't wait for more."", ""Meh. Just meh. This film looks like a 50 dollar steak but tastes like a turkey sandwich you forgot about in the refrigerator for a day. It isn't bad but doesn't make you want anymore. And I think that is why they had to shoehorn Johnny Depp in at the end of this, because otherwise no one would care enough to watch a sequel. The dude playing the wizard looking for his pets is meh. The story felt like filler. I honestly have no idea why people consider this film anything other than mediocre. I guess die-hard Harry Potter fans are so desperate for more Harry Potter stuff on the big screen that they are willing to pretend this film is something special when it really isn't."", ""It's always tough for a reboot or a reimagining of a franchise to win over the hearts of all viewers. The Harry Potter films were this generation's Star Wars. It was always going to be an uphill battle for Fantastic Beasts and in my opinion, the film never even got off the ground. With no heart, weak visual effects, and surprisingly little imagination, Fantastic Beasts and How to Get Bored turns out the most disappointing film going experience of this year.I'm going to try and not compare the film too much to its predecessors, because that's ultimately unfair. This was a new thing. There are only a few little references here and there to characters we knew. After all, this film takes place 70 years before Harry entered Hogwarts. With that said, I'm not sure what the appeal here is without an attachment to the series. Sure, J.K. Rowling comes back and makes her screen writing debut, but the script felt so basic and unimaginative. Aside from some nicely time physical humor, this was a sloppily paced missed opportunity.Our new wizard team comprised of talented actors Eddie Redmayne, Katherine Waterson, Dan Fogler, and Alison Sudol. I'm not sure if it was because the youth and innocence is no longer there (like with the original team at Hogwarts), but I didn't care at all for the team. Fogler, who plays Kowalski, has some great (and I mean great) comedic moments, but I didn't find anything compelling or charismatic about this particular group. Unfortunately, Redmayne gets lost in his obscure quirkiness (as does Ezra Miller for that matter), and Colin Farrell's Graves' character was criminally underused.Speaking of Farrell, I have no idea why he would want to take on such a role. The third act reveals that Farrell is actually the dangerous wizard, Grindelwald undercover. Of course, none other than Johnny Depp himself was officially cast as Grindelwald a few weeks ago for the upcoming films. Why in the world get such a talented actor in Farrell if you're just going to switch him to another famous actor the next second? It just seemed like a waste to me.I hope other people found enjoyment in this film, because I certainly did not. But hey, I still have faith that a sequel could be good. 5 movies? I'm not so sure about, but I wouldn't mind seeing another one of these films. Coming from a big Potter film fan, this was a massive disappointment.+Kowalski provided some entertainment-Farrell wasted-No real heart-The new team is uninteresting and lacks charisma-Surprisingly mediocre CGI4.0/10"", 'Since when movies like this one took over? No plot, no characters development, no substance, cheap jokes here and there and CGI filling up space. Just another film that tries to squeeze bucks out of franchise without genuine effort.Nothing happens throughout the whole movie, literally. For the most of it, Eddie Redmayne searches for his beasts and tries to imprison them in his suitcase. We are supposed to be amazed by them, but we have seen alike a long time ago in previous HP, Avatar or even LOTR movies, so they alone simply don\'t cut it. Then there is a brief fight with ""the bad slash confused guys"" and that\'s it.I had a hard time to find out who is the main villain almost the entire movie, and I definitely didn\'t discover his motives. The revelation of the villain was stupid and embarrassing and everybody except for hardcore HP fans doesn\'t have a chance to know what the hell is going on with him. Showing this dark matter damaging streets like each 15 minutes didn\'t help and got quickly boring, because it didn\'t pose any actual threat to our heroes, and its only purpose was to fill the holes with CGI and banging sound anyway (I guess).I felt no connection to any of the characters whatsoever. Redmayne acts like a crazy nerdo who has feelings only for his monsters, Katherine Waterston is uninteresting bureaucratic mouse and her sister behaves like a slut. The baker was OK, but each one of them was acting unnaturally. This is completely different from HP, where I could feel for Harry (or others for that matter) struggling with his substitute family, adaptation to a foreign environment, love, hate and at last burden of great responsibility, and even though Daniel Radcliffe hasn\'t shown that great performance at least in the first movies, I could relate to him and understand him.Fantastic Beasts has not brought anything new, we have seen all the wizard stuff before - all the ""automated"" tools working by themselves, habitable suitcase instead of a tent, creation of this defensive bubble etc. New York didn\'t help either, gone is the magical atmosphere from UK and Hogwarts. The magic as such is treated just too casually here.I hadn\'t expected much, but still was disappointed. The thing is, that this movie isn\'t nowadays an exception any more, and it strongly reminds me of the last Star Wars movies, whose sole purpose is to grab your money and let you wait for next one in a trilogy to at least get an explanation and some satisfaction. Can\'t we produce solid standalone movies anymore? What a letdown !', 'I will keep this brief....No significant story to speak of...the film just drones on and on with the ""gotta catch the creatures that escaped from the suitcase"" crap. That is basically it.Poor/inadequate character development. There are just ""characters"" in the movie....we know little to nothing about them or their motivations....and care little to nothing about what happens to any of them.The essence of the film is ""look at the weird and charming CGI creatures we created"". I cannot believe that after all the years of CGI...the producers of this movie still believed that effects alone can make a movie....but apparently they do. The CGI is not new or refreshing in any way that I could see...just CGI.I am sure this movie will get some audience in the first few days, just by tapping into the ""Harry Potter"" world. But it won\'t last. Word will get out, and the (currently ridiculously inflated) IMDb ratings will drop like a stone.Take my word on this. This is a boring and bland failure of a movie. I slept through about a third of it, and those moments of unconsciousness were the best part.', 'Having grown up with the Harry Potter books, and as someone who found a lot to like with all the films (though admittedly some were better than others), expectations were high for \'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\'. Especially also with such good word of mouth.Those high expectations were met, and more. \'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\' serves as an introduction to the new era of the wizarding world, and not succeeds brilliantly doing that but also works as a magical slice of entertainment in its own. A long film it is, but a vast majority of the time it doesn\'t feel like it, so engrossing is the world that the film creates.Not all\'s perfect. \'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\' takes a bit of time to get going, with a slow and overlong introduction that tended to also be confusingly written. Jon Voight is wasted as a character with not much personality or development and with a subplot that practically is forgotten about, both by the viewer and by the film. It is too early to tell how well Grindelwald will fare as a villain, but first impressions weren\'t that promising with Johnny Depp\'s performance not really igniting my fire, for somebody who specialises in oddball roles he just seemed too lightweight for such an evil character. This said, the future films I\'m sure will turn this around if they keep going forward rather than backward.\'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\' lives up to its name visually. The look of the film is spellbinding, from the wonderful use of colour, with perfectly contrasting shades of light and dark, to cinematography that is never garish and too simple or murky and convoluted, a standout of the latter being that long shot of Credence and Graves in the alley. The standout is easily for the interiors of the suitcase, our looks of awe matching the characters\'. Even better are the special effects for the creatures, all of which are technical marvels. This said they are more than that, they are also creatures with their own distinct identity and purpose, as great as Demiguise, Occamy and Thunderbird the standout is the adorable Niffler who also provides some of the biggest and best laughs.James Newton Howard\'s music score has the right amount of the haunting, the whimsical, the ethereal and the rousing, always dynamic with the action and what\'s going on in the film. The script has some grim social-commentary and suspense, which gives the film its darkness, while also bringing some perfectly pitched humour (mostly from Jacob and the Niffler), poignant emotion and sense of wonder, while balancing these different tones in a way that never makes one think ""it\'s trying to be too many things"" or ""it doesn\'t know what it wants to be"". The references to details from Harry Potter will make die-hard fans squeal with delight, they certainly gave me a sense of nostalgia. There is a lot going on in the story, but all in a way that is told with charm, exuberant and offbeat wit, enchanting imagination and nail-biting suspense. Loved the little details as well, such as the wand-shining house elfs, the bake-offs, the office-cleaning and the magically translucent umbrellas.David Yates was more than ideal as director, having the firm ground from having directed the last four Harry Potter films. There are no complaints to be had visually and technically, and, other than the slow start, could find little to fault with the way the story was told. The characters are well drawn and their personalities well established, with the only real glaring exception being with Voight\'s character. Found myself really caring for the heroes and the creatures, and got a real sense of threat from the villains (excepting Grindelwald).Acting was top notch, apart from Depp (and Voight doesn\'t really have much to work with to make any distinction), with Eddie Redmayne on superbly eccentric and endearingly quirky form. He is ideally matched by an affecting Alison Sudol, a charming Katherine Waterson and a highly amusing and amiable Dan Folger. On villain duty is Colin Farrell playing his dastardly role with smarmy relish and a chilling and heart-breakingly repressed Ezra Miller, though the latter is more ambiguous as a character whereas the former is full-on villainous. Samantha Morton also impresses.On the whole, a magical introduction to the new era wizarding world, and mostly it is fantastic. 8/10 Bethany Cox', 'J. K. Rowling added a new dimension to the Harry Potter universe with a story about the author of one of Harry\'s textbooks. ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" depicts eccentric wizard Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) in New York City in 1926. A mishap gives Newt a few unplanned adventures amid the supernatural occurrences plaguing the city. And there are a few references that should catch people\'s attention. Overall, from what I could tell, the movie makes a point about discrimination and witch-hunting (and the laws against wizards marrying non-wizards is probably an allusion to the infamous anti-miscegenation laws).But most importantly, it\'s a fun movie. As in the original series, each of the characters has something to contribute. David Yates, who directed a couple of the Harry Potter movies, does a good job here.', ""I really enjoyed watching this film. It is visually astounding with some amazing creatures which inhabit a world that is familiar to us, New York of the 1920's. Eddie Redmain comes to the big city from London to find a weird creature. It is quite destructive and his task is difficult because laws have been passed against magic. There are several factions in the city, the strength of whom is difficult to pinpoint. We have no trouble realizing who the heroes are, but the infighting within the administration is not totally clear (although I'm probably too inept to get it the first time). There is a delicate balance between the edgy, dire blackness of Harry Potter and its humor. Some of the creatures are hilarious, but when push comes to shove, there is nothing funny about what is happening. Lives are being lost and religious fanatics are seizing power. Life in the city is crippled by poverty and despair. I understand there are several films yet to be made that bank on the unanswered questions in this one. I am hoping to watch this again to get more of an understanding of it. Oh! The special effects are beyond belief."", 'I kept waiting to engage with either the characters or with one of the beasts. Such an engagement was not forthcoming. I like Eddie Redmayne, so it is nothing to do with him. So much emphasis on creating this alternate world that the basics of filmmaking appear to have been sacrificed. Never does anyone look into you, the screen, and speak. There is never any eye contact. You do not feel attached to Eddie\'s character. Even my children were squirming in the seats and looking around bored. They wanted food and said they were hungry. The movie therefore appears to fail both children and adults like me. My 12yo son who is a mega Harry Potter fan could not engage with the movie. ""I like reading J K Rowling\'s books but I am not sure about this one"" is what he said. What he means is that, after having watched the movie, it has put him off the book as well. I got up to get food for the kids, they followed me and were more keen on ice creams and sweets rather than getting back to the screen to what happened next. So much for fantastic pointless beasts. If you liked Harry Potter then that is not a guarantee that you will like this one. That is for sure. If you liked The Lord of Rings and sat through the trilogy, then you may have what it takes to sit through this one. Perhaps looking at this as a movie nothing to do with Harry Potter might help. If your children do not get attached to the movie then don\'t be surprised.', 'Borderline Charmless with a Lead Character (Eddie Redmayne) that Mumbles, Withdraws, and is Virtually Lifeless. The Female Lead (Katherine Waterston) is a Good Pairing because Her Character is Lifeless too. Then there\'s Jon Voight, who is Absent Anything to do with a Sub-Plot that goes Nowhere. Colin Farrell (as a main antagonist) seems Depressed to be there.It doesn\'t Bode Well when the most Engaging Characters are Secondary, Dan Fogler and Samantha Morton and Their Flirtatious Frolicking Occasionally Lifts the Movie from its Doldrums, as do a few of the Titular Beasts.But the Look of the Movie is Drab Brown and the Film is Drab in other ways. There is Very Little Energy when a Beast isn\'t On Screen and the Production seems Static and Stiff.The CGI is Generic and the ""X-Men Mutant vs Human"" Story is a Lazy Recycling. In the End the Main Antagonist is a Reveal that is Not-Surprising and is Rendered as a Whirling Spiral of a Dark Liquid Mist (talk about a let-down).It\'s an OK Time-Waster but Overall it\'s such a Waste of Budget, Writing Talent, and when Imagination is Lacking in a Film that IS Imagination, it becomes a Missed Opportunity at Best and at Worst, a Disappointing Development in a Franchise that Deserves Better.', ""J.K Rowling, not content with having milked 'Harry Potter' for all it was worth (quite a lot as it turned out) has now decided to expand her 'wizarding world' with this sort of spin-off series.Sadly this first instalment isn't that fantastic, in fact it's lots of special effects holding together a paper thin plot that seems largely to involve poor Eddie Redmayne running here, there and everywhere trying to catch whichever creature has escaped from his suitcase next.There are moments, yes, when this film actually lives up to its billing, and I'll be interested to see where the franchise goes, but this was a load of old nothing really."", ""21 November 2016 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. For those of you who are missing the adventures of Harry Potter and his wizarding world, Fantastic Beasts plugs that gap with alacrity. With a cast headed by the supremely talented Eddie Redmayne, as Newt Scamander, this film immerses us once more into a place where the world of wizard and No-Maj (American for Muggle) collide. We are again treated to an insight of the machinations of J K Rowling's brain, and I for one am always happy that she shares it with our world. You absolutely do not have to watch any of the Harry Potter films to understand any of the references to Muggles, Hogwarts and the like, this film is story on its own and we are introduced to a whole new collection of characters.......and magical beasts, some of which are cute and some downright weird. Excellent visual effects, and a screenplay which includes more than a few lighthearted moments. Another smash from the wizarding world and I eagerly await the next instalment."", ""A lot has changed since the first Harry Potter film was released in 2001. Heck, a lot has changed since the LAST Harry Potter film was released in 2011. The franchise helped change our modern interpretation of what a film series can be. And this prequel spin-off is proof of that. While this isn't a Harry Potter movie, it's part of the same world.In the 15 years since Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, blockbuster films have become consistently good. Critically acclaimed. It's not just popcorn entertainment anymore--we have higher expectations. And as the blockbusters strive for the quality of the more highbrow indie offerings being nominated for Oscars, they begin resembling them in a way.The Harry Potter films, especially the first few, had a sort of snappy storytelling to them. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them does not. It's much slower like the later films in the previous series. Yet, the difference is, this is the setup to the next four films. By the time we got to the last few Harry Potter movies, we weren't exactly looking for a brisk narrative. And I was hoping for this in Fantastic Beasts--albeit, probably unrealistically.Set in 1926, an English wizard, Newt (Eddie Redmayne), comes to America for McGuffin-like reasons (and unclear, at that). He gets into some trouble as some of the fantastic beasts escape from the suitcase where he's keeping them. As this is happening, he gets mixed in with a normal non-magical human, Jacob (Dan Fogler).Other assorted things happen that are appealing to the audience. We get to go inside this magical suitcase and see dozens of unique creatures in this new expanded universe. It's really cool and aesthetically pleasing.The movie is long and not enough happens to truly justify it. Instead of using the time to thoroughly explain some of the overarching story lines, the filmmakers spend it drawing things out. Perhaps because they feel like they have to.Don't get me wrong, the film is great. It's thoroughly enjoyable. It does most of the things a good film should do. While the storytelling isn't quick, it's still very even.This is what director David Yates is good at, as evident in the last four Harry Potter films he directed. Though Fantastic Beasts is missing the magical world that is Hogwarts, Yates knows how to bring alive New York City in the '20s and make it feel magical.You will most likely enjoy Fantastic Beasts. If for no other reason than the fact that it's the ingress back into the beloved world of Harry Potter.And Easter eggs are scattered all around. Just don't go into it with the same expectations as its predecessors.Twizard Rating: 93"", ""It is unbelievable that JK Rowling's name is even attached to this film.The discipline and thought that went into the Harry Potter characters and story certainly wasn't applied to this catastrophe, which, like the Hobbit and so many other Hollywood regurgitation(s), merely seeks massive profits by piggybacking on a successful franchise while being utterly devoid of substance.It isn't even worth going into detail. There is only one truly likable character, though you can't relate to ANY character as we know absolutely nothing about them, nor do they have any developed relationships with each other. The entire script is built around the magical creatures doing damage to NYC, again, a ridiculous premise, as the damage is massive and there is no backlash. The complicated boundaries between the magical and non-magical worlds and people, so well laid out in HP, are completely absent. The most ridiculous example of idiotic, careless detail is that for most of the scenes on the streets of NYC, it is practically a ghost town, whereas in reality, NYC in the 1920s was nearly as densely populated as it is now. Perhaps more so, not worth it to fact check this. And Eddie Redmayne as the lead was totally inaccessible, not engaging and half of his speech literally unintelligible. Fully one third into the movie it is finally established that he, the lead character, is closer to magical creatures than humans, but by then, not only do we not care about him or like him, but really the script gives him not ONE real relationship wherein to show forth his character. Who is he? Where does he come from? We don't know. Anyway, a horrible choice for a lead character, someone who has no emotional connection to any characters. Even his relations to the animals is explored surface level, there is no one relationship with anyone or anything that develops throughout the story and makes the audience care about the character. Only superficial plot-related details are given and there is no emotional or human life at all.This is the same way all the characters, every single one, is treated. They are merely 2 dimensional props, there to perpetuate a plot that is mostly centered around special effects and hubris action, magical creatures rampaging here and there, and, as I said, unrealistically, going on undetected.Literally, not one shining point to this film. Another disgrace to storytelling, devoid of all substance and creativity, pumped out of the Warner Bros fecal-making factory. Utterly disappointed."", ""In the year 1926 in the Harry Potter universe, the dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald is terrorizing the magical community. Witches and wizards from all over the world are on high alert as he prepares to launch his next attack.Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) travels from London to New York City with a briefcase full of magical creatures, or fantastic beasts. When he arrives, his case is inspected by a customs official, but Newt is able to hide the magic from muggle eyes.Some men are inspecting a building downtown that has been torn through. The auror Percival Graves (Colin Farrell) comes by to see the damage. An unseen force runs underground and destroys part of the street.As he walks through the city, Newt comes across Mary Lou Barebone (Samantha Morton), a fundamentalist and leader of the Second Salemers, an anti-magic group. With her adopted children -- Credence (Ezra Miller), Modesty (Faith Wood-Blagrove), and Chastity (Jenn Murray) -- she spreads a hateful message about magic folk and how they need to be exterminated. As she tries to get Newt to join her, a niffler escapes from his case when it sees a shiny silver coin. It makes its way into the bank, forcing Newt to go after it.Inside the bank, Newt meets Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler), a factory worker who is there to apply for a loan so he can open a bakery. Newt runs off when he sees the niffler, leaving behind an occamy egg that Jacob picks up. Newt tries to catch the niffler while Jacob meets with a bank employee to get the loan, but since he uses baked goods as collateral instead of something valuable, he is denied. Before Newt can grab the niffler, Jacob notes that the egg is hatching. Newt uses his wand to pull Jacob toward him, which is seen by Porpentina Goldstein (Katherine Waterston), an American witch. Newt and Jacob find the niffler in the bank vault just as a bank employee catches them. Newt petrifies him and gets the niffler to drop all the things it stole before he apparates himself and Jacob out of the bank. Newt prepares to obliviate Jacob and wipe his memories, but Jacob grabs his case and hits Newt in the face before running off. Tina catches Newt and takes him with her after seeing what he's been carrying.Tina brings Newt to the headquarters of the Magical Congress of the United States of America (MACUSA) because he was using magic in front of no-majes (the American term for muggles). The MACUSA president, Seraphina Picquery (Carmen Ejogo), is not happy to see Tina there since she was once an auror but was dismissed due to a previous incident. Tina takes Newt to her old office and is confronted by Graves and other aurors. When Graves demands to see what's in the suitcase, they find that Newt grabbed Jacob's case full of pastries.Jacob brings Newt's case to his apartment and accidentally opens it, setting loose a few of the creatures, including the niffler.Mary Lou is seen operating an orphanage where she teaches children about the evils of the magical community. Modesty sings songs about killing witches, while Credence suffers physical and emotional abuse from Mary Lou. She takes the children to meet Langdon Shaw (Ronan Raftery), brother of Senator Henry Shaw, Jr. (Josh Cowdery). Langdon brings Mary Lou and the kids to meet Henry and their father, Henry Sr. (Jon Voight), but both he and the senator dismiss the Barebones as freaks, which appears to irk Credence.Credence meets in secrecy with Graves, who needs Credence's help in locating a child with immense powers. In return, Graves promises that he'll help Credence get away from the abusive Mary Lou.Newt and Tina find Jacob's building, which has been partially destroyed. Jacob has been attacked by a murtlap, which has scratched his neck. Newt grabs the creature and throws him back into his case, while repairing the apartment. He and Tina take Jacob with them away from the apartment.The three go to Tina's apartment, which she shares with her younger sister Queenie (Alison Sudol), an expert legilimens (she can read minds). Jacob is immediately smitten with her, and Queenie can see it but she doesn't mind. Newt and Jacob go to rest in their room, but Newt hops inside his briefcase and invites Jacob to join him. Newt gives Jacob a treatment for his neck wound and then shows him the various habitats made for the creatures that dwell in there. Newt shows Jacob a thunderbird named Frank, which Newt claims is the main reason he traveled to America: he wants to return Frank to his natural habitat in Arizona. Jacob comes across a particularly dark entity encased in a bubble, called an obscurial, which Newt orders Jacob to stay away from. He then asks for Jacob's help in retrieving the missing creatures. Jacob agrees.Newt and Jacob go on the town and find the niffler trying to rob a jewelry store. Newt chases the niffler through the store, causing significant damage to the whole place. The cops arrive as Newt catches it. The cops are distracted when they see a lion walking through the streets, giving Newt a chance to apparate himself and Jacob out of there.The guys continue walking through the city and see other zoo animals running loose. They see another creature, a huge erumpent, wandering around. Newt gives Jacob a helmet in preparation for catching the beast, then does a bizarre mating dance to lure it toward him. The erumpent sees Jacob and goes after him instead, but Newt manages to pull it back into the briefcase. Tina, who has gone looking for the guys after seeing they weren't in their room, sees them catching the erumpent.A conference is held for Senator Shaw as part of his bid for presidency. A rumbling shakes the entire building before an unseen and powerful force sweeps through the place, grabs Shaw, and slams him to the floor, killing him. Henry Sr. goes over to his son's body while Langdon knows it's the work of witches.Tina brings Newt's briefcase to the MACUSA as they are gathered with other witches and wizards from around the world in the wake of Shaw's death. Tina opens the briefcase to let Newt and Jacob out. When the aurors learn that an obscurial was responsible for Shaw's death, and that Newt and Tina have let Jacob, a no-maj, become aware of their world, Graves confiscates the briefcase and has the three arrested.Graves interrogates Newt about the obscurial in his briefcase. Believing him to be a fanatic of Grindelwald's in his agenda to put the magical community above the non-magic community through murderous means, Graves sentences Newt and Tina to death. Queenie overhears this as she reads Tina's mind.While locked up, Newt explains to Tina and Jacob that an obscurial is a dark force created out of a magical child's suppression of their powers. The children who conjure up obscurials don't live past the age of 10.Newt and Tina are brought into a room where they are to be placed into a pool that will kill them. One of the witches extracts some of Tina's memories. One shows her as a child; in another she attacks Mary Lou and tries to comfort Credence. Before Tina is killed, Newt unleashes one of the creatures in the room to escape with Tina. When Queenie shows up, they get Jacob and she sneaks them out in the briefcase.At the Barebone home, Credence is growing more and more unstable. He finds a wand in Modesty's room, which Mary Lou sees and thinks belongs to him. She gets ready to beat him again until Modesty admits the wand was hers. The obscurial gets loose and kills Mary Lou before destroying the rest of the house, leaving only Credence and Modesty alive. Graves later finds Credence and urges him to find Modesty, since Graves now believes she is the child that he foresaw.Newt, Tina, Jacob, and Queenie go to a magic speakeasy in Harlem called the Blind Pig. They ask the owner, a goblin gangster named Gnarlack (Ron Perlman), for information on finding the last missing beast, a demiguise that Newt named Dougal. Gnarlack wants something in trade, and he has his eyes set on a little bowtruckle resting in Newt's jacket pocket. Newt reluctantly hands over the bowtruckle, which reaches out for Newt. Gnarlack tells them to go searching in a Macy's. Almost immediately, Gnarlack reveals that he sold the heroes out to the MACUSA, who come in and go after the heroes. Jacob punches Gnarlack in the face before they have to escape.The heroes go to the Macy's and find Dougal, who is looking after an occamy (a large, winged, serpentine creature) hiding up on the ceiling. It causes trouble in the store for the heroes, but Newt tells Jacob and Tina to get an insect and a teapot. Jacob gets a roach and Tina grabs a teapot; Jacob tosses the roach into the teapot, allowing them to catch the occamy as it shrinks and is caught in the teapot.Inside the briefcase, Queenie sees a picture of a girl named Leta Lestrange (Zoë Kravitz), who has an old connection to Newt. He doesn't want to talk about it as their relationship seems to have ended unhappily.Graves and Credence find Modesty in her old family home. When Graves makes it clear that he will not help Credence despite his promises, Credence's rage intensifies, and it turns out that he is the one who has been possessed by the obscurial. His advanced age has allowed him to build up his power, making him the most powerful obscurial alive. Credence sets off through the city streets, leaving a trail of destruction behind him.Newt goes after Credence since he knows the aurors will kill him without knowing the truth about him. He tracks Credence to an underground subway station and soothes him back into his normal form. But when Graves, Tina, and the aurors all arrive, Credence returns to his obscurial form. Although Newt and Tina urge the aurors to let them handle Credence, Picquery orders them to kill Credence. They fire their wands at Credence and destroy him. Graves then berates the aurors for their rules and handling of the magical and non-magical communities. Picquery orders Graves to hand over his wand and surrender, but he defies her and fights the other aurors. He is able to protect himself against their blasts, but he is subdued by Newt and is bound. Newt uses the Revelio charm on Graves, revealing him to be none other than Grindelwald (Johnny Depp). He is promptly arrested.Newt uses Frank to take a potion into the sky so that it can rain over all the no-majes nearby and obliviate them. Picquery thanks Newt for what he did, but reminds him that Jacob has to be obliviated as well, since there are no exceptions. Jacob tearfully says goodbye to Newt, Tina, and Queenie, then asks Newt why he let him stick around. Newt says he likes Jacob and thinks of him as a friend. Jacob stands in the rain, but Queenie steps in with her wand to create an umbrella to kiss Jacob. When he opens his eyes, the three are gone.Jacob returns to his old factory job, still unhappy with where he is. Newt bumps into him and drops a briefcase full of occamy egg shells, which are made of silver, and a note explaining this so that Jacob can use it as collateral to open his bakery.Newt is going back to London and says goodbye to Tina at the ship terminal. He promises to return with a manuscript of his book, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, so he can personally give it to Tina.A while later, Jacob's bakery business is booming, as he has fashioned his pastries to look like some of the beasts he vaguely remembers encountering. Queenie visits the shop. Jacob sees her and appears to remember her a little.""]"
63,Wizarding World,Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,4123430,"[""Am something of a fan of Harry Potter, books and films. Having grown up with the franchise and cherishing the fond memories being engrossed in the books, the midnight shopping trips to get the latest one and watching the films in the cinema being entertained, dazzled and at times even scared. Found myself really enjoying the first 'Fantastic Beasts' film, though not all my friends and family did for understandable reasons.Had high hopes for 'Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald'. It became one of my most anticipated films of the year after being captivated by the trailer. Although the critical reception was mixed, the high hopes were not shattered because word of mouth from friends, whose opinions this reviewer always trusts, was positive and am someone aiming to see all the film for franchise completest sake. My thoughts after watching 'Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald' were mostly positive though with a few fairly serious misgivings.'Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald' is a sequel that is bigger in spectacle, darker in content and bolder in its basic story. Yet, compared to some sequels that have earned that distinction by me, it is an example of a follow-up that fell short of being better. It wasn't for me vastly inferior and the drop in quality was not large, although visually this film looked better and preferred the cast here too the previous film had more focus and cohesion and the creatures were used better. Can totally see where critics are coming from while also seeing what those who liked it saw in it.Will get the not so good things out of the way. Do agree with those who have described 'Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald' as over-stuffed. There are too many characters and not all of them are necessary and the others given too short shrift, the inclusion of Nicolas Flamel for instance was pointless with him having literally nothing to do and felt merely there as a thrown in Harry Potter reference. It was great to see life at Hogwarts and feel nostalgic with the references, but that was also hurt by that what was shown didn't seem to fit continuity-wise.There were too many story strands too, variably explored. Making the story feel cluttered and not always focused, which affects the cohesion. The big revelation(s) in the last act, especially for what seemed to be the conclusion of the main story strand, did confuse me and needed much more breathing space for the viewer to take it all in, one is left in a whirlwind that gets bigger.Some of the pace could have been tighter, with some of the middle act meandering and not always involving. The ending came over as a bit rushed to me, well-staged but a slowing down pace-wise would have made the crucial revelations much clearer.However, 'Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald' has a lot of fantastic elements. Once again, it does look great and looks even better perhaps than the previous film. The production design is wondrous, especially once in Paris though loved the look of Hogwarts as well, and it is beautifully shot, with tighter editing and slightly more polished effects (though both were great in the previous film). Loved the little details too. The return of James Newton-Howard was a more than welcome one, with a score that is even more haunting, more whimsical, more ethereal and more rousing, one standout being in the beginning with the phantom carriage.Enjoyed enough of the script, with enough thoughtful, emotional (did feel for Credence) and amusing parts, the last one being provided by Jacob and the Niffler. Though there are parts that don't make the script here as focused as before and die-hard Harry Potter fans won't be squealing with delight as much and feeling as nostalgic over the references because the continuity fitted much more before. Although the story execution is flawed, there is charm, offbeat wit, imagination and nail-biting suspense, so the magic is there. Another improvement over the previous film is that the beginning gets to the point more and is better paced.David Yates' direction shows experience and he handles the set pieces very well. The phantom carriage escape and Ministry Library scenes really stand out, while the circus freak show part is suspenseful and intriguing. Would have loved to have seen far more of the creatures and more variety but when they do appear they are delightful and each serve purpose to the story. Again not only are they technical marvels they also have personality, the most used is the Zouwu, while the one that serves most point to the story is Pickett. My favourite will always be Niffler though. The characters are worth caring for generally and the cast are on great form. Eddie Redmayne has even more nuance and charm here and Johnny Depp's evil personified Grindelwald is vastly improved here. Ezra Miller's repression and Zoe Kravitz's empathy are moving to watch while Dan Fogler is amiable and very funny. Genius casting too is provided by Jude Law as Dumbledore, a fine example of creating enormous impression in relatively minor screen time. Katherine Waterston, while still commanding the screen beautifully, is on the underused side and Alison Sudol is not as charming.Overall, an enjoyable film with many fantastic elements. Just wanted it to be more fantastic than it turned out to be. 7/10 Bethany Cox"", ""THE CRIMES OF GRINDELWALD is the FANTASTIC BEASTS follow-up that nobody asked for, but I guess there's more money yet to be made from the wizarding world. This turns out to be of the same quality as the first film, i.e. quite dreadful, and it doesn't help that Rowling herself turned in the screenplay. It's unfocused, meandering, almost plotless at times, with way too many uninteresting characters, none of whom appeal. As usual, the emphasis is on delivering snazzy CGI effect after snazzy CGI effect, but this gives the whole thing a real detachment from reality that makes it vapid to watch. Cast-wise, Redmayne is the worst he's ever been, while Johnny Depp's stock villain feels sleazy rather than menacing. It's also one of those mid-series films that has no real beginning, middle or end, and as such feels completely pointless."", ""In 1927 New York City, evil wizard Grindelwald (Johnny Depp) escapes a prison transport and heads to Paris with his supporters. In London, Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) refuses British Ministry of Magic's command to hunt Grindelwald. It's revealed that it was Albus Dumbledore (Jude Law) who sent Newt to NYC and this time he sends him to Paris. Newt is joined by Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler). Tina Goldstein (Katherine Waterston) is already there searching for lost pure-blood wizard Credence Barebone (Ezra Miller) along with everyone else. Her sister Queenie (Alison Sudol) falls under the persuasion of Grindelwald.This has plenty of wizarding whiz bangs. It has too much twisting back-bending back stories. Some of the characters are acting in strange ways. This is overloaded. J. K. Rowling should consider not writing for the novel but concentrate on writing for the movie. There is too much of everything. I don't understand Queenie's dark turn. I hoped that she was playing along but that seems extremely unlikely. For some reason, Tina has turned a lot colder. I didn't understand the significance of Credence at the start which makes his reveal less compelling. This movie follows a dozen main characters which is about six too many. For Potter fans, this is a must but this prequel franchise is not a necessity for casual fans."", '...maybe too many. From cast to special effects, to Victorian stories to the clash between words. The only problem- the story. Or, more precise, The Real Story. Because the stories of the characters are only pieces but the puzzle seems ignored. And , like a prestidigitation, you ignore that. But, sure, a nice film. With many virtues, maybe too many.', 'Let me start this review by saying that you should skip the watch here if you haven\'t seen the first or second movie. Now, here we go: ""The Crimes of Grindelwald"" is the second film from the ""Fantastic Beasts"" movie series. This one here is a new 2018 release from this year and of course director David Yates is on board again here and the screen writer is J.K. Rowling, both from the Harry Potter series eventually. I did not like the first FB movie if I remember correctly, but rewatched it recently before seeing this second film and it grew a bit on me I must admit. This second one is fine too, but it never reaches greatness. I have read people say that they were disappointed how the character of Newt Scamander loses a great deal of screen time to the supporting players here. Well, I do agree, but I don\'t think it is a problem and I am writing this as a fan of the Oscar-winning actor Eddie Redmayne. After all, the title includes the beasts and it includes the main antagonist as well, played by Johnny Depp as we found out at the very end of the first film. But it does not include Newt Scamander, so you should not expect him to be a force as dominant as Radcliffe in the Potter films. And there is a certain irony that not one of them (eight in total I think) managed to win the Oscar, but the very first FB did. We\'ll see next year how this one fares awards-wise. I think it will maybe be nominated in two visual categories, costumes and sets or so. We\'ll see.But now about the film itself. I must say one very memorable aspect here was the presence of Jude Law playing the young Albus Dumbledore. Perhaps the best casting decision of the year and he really won me over and the actor is steadily growing on me too. I am genuinely curious what he will have in store for us for the next three movies. But not just him of course. The closing credits rolled in once again as a cliffhanger and we shall see especially what is going to happen with Johnny Depp\'s character. I am naturally not the very biggest Depp fan, but after some early struggles I liked him more and more and I was glad he and his character are included in the movie. The big spectacular scene towards the end with the circle and the powers around it is an absolute highlight here that makes this film probably infinitely better to watch on the big screen than on the small screen. Go pay these bucks. And yes there are once again quite a few memorable beasts included here too. Some new, some old. I will never be as much of a fan as Scamander is of this little locust creature, but I do love the little furry platipus lookalike. Really want one of these as my pet too.Cast-wise the film brings back many of the actors from the first film. More than I expected for sure. For example I thought the story with the funny guy who becomes the baker and his (potential) girlfriend was finished at the end of the first film, but no, they are both back, especially the female and her role is far more significant than in the first movie where she was basically just the other sister. Another character I was surprised to see back and that he hadn\'t died as implied in the first was Credence. I never thought his part in the second film would be so big. On the one hand, you could say they lacked ideas for new crucial characters as aside from young Dumbledore there isn\'t really anybody new, on the other you must say in Rowling\'s favor that she wrote everybody in a way where nobody feels for the sake of it and bringing so many old characters back with new and fresh story lines was quite the challenge I\'m sure. And she mastered it and proves she is not just a talented author, but also a gifted screen wright, even if the subject all works in her favor of course.So I think it was a good watch and you should give it a go, especially if you like fantasy films and if you liked the first Scamander outing 2 years ago. I am positive that they will keep delivering quality with the next 3 as well. The argument it is all cheap cashing in is not really valid in my opinion. If it is really all quantity over quality, then how come so many people are seeing these films in theaters. The answer is because they are interesting and bring a whole lot of creativity to the table, plus solid acting and magnificent visual production values, which is simply impossible to deny. I can see people struggling with the stories and yes it is not a masterpiece, but good enough for me. These over 2 hours flew by pretty quickly. It\'s a thumbs-up from me and I recommend seeing FB 2.', 'Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald shows that J K Rowling should not be writing screenplays although I am sure Steve Kloves who is credited as Executive Producer had a hand in the script.It is also evident that the directorial duties needs a new vision. David Yates has been too long in the Potter world.The film is a rehash of the early X-Men films. An allegory. Purebloods need to breakout and overcome the humans who are the true monsters. Grindelwald even shows them a vision of the man made future, World War 2 and the rise of Nazism. The trouble is Grindelwald has his own fascist foot soldiers.The plot consists of Grindelwald predictably escaping. Newt Scamander is sent by Albus Dumbledore to go look for him. The ministry of magic is stifling all dissent and free thinkers. In short they are driving wizards to the arms of someone like Grindelwald. Everyone is after a young man called Credence Barebone who just wants to find his mother and who he really is.The film has great spectacle but it is too long and the plot is too slim. Parts of the film is set in Hogwarts and actually makes you realise that these prequels are a cynical cash in by Warner Brothers.', ""May have plot spoilers.About the third Harry Potter movie, they made the books longer and the movies shorter creating plot holes and gaps that only the reader of the books would know, or it was glossed over. It has gotten worse. We are introduced to our bad guy, Grindelwald (Johnny Depp) who is treated like Hannibal Lechter in 1927. He is albino looking and speaks like Mordevolt. He wants to start a second war with the non-wizards and rule over them in order to prevent WWII. Apparently, the wizards somehow lost the previous war which is why they are in hiding. Go figure.He escapes as we are re-introduced to the characters in the first film. Albus Dumbledore (Jude Law) is the only wizard strong enough to stop him, but won't as it is strongly hinted that they were lovers. Newt (Eddie Redmayne) takes on the task with a gazillion subplots and backstories which took away from the overall entertainment value. Sometimes less is more. There is also a guy looking for his mommy, a fake news story, and a woman abducted and forced to have another man's child. We also see a young Minerva McGonagall.And the story doesn't end. It is left open for a sequel."", ""I know I'm not alone, but I have to state again, that at this point in time, I have not read (nor listened) to any of the (audio) books. And that includes Harry Potter of course. Having said all that, I'm only settting the stage so you know that I can't compare this to any of the source material. Now this has a few things in it, that are callbacks to the first movie and we do get familiar characters back with their quirks.There's also new characters of course and for some it may feel convoluted. But this is just a fun ride and I can see that this is just a side step or just a filler like another reviewer stated to get to the next movies. You know introduce a few things that probably will pay off along the road. Technically this really looks good. Story and character wise there is not much happening though. Not anything note- or new(s)-worthy that is. Still decent and entertaining and isn't that what this all is about? (No?)"", ""A preponderance of characters and a story line that seems intentionally confusing may hinder your viewing pleasure here. Part of my problem is that I'm not personally invested in the wizarding world of J.K Rowling, and ran out of steam near the end of the Harry Potter series of films. So I come to the Fantastic Beasts movies with an open mind and willingness to be entertained. There seemed to be some open ended, unresolved issues at the end of this story, not surprising as there are sequels yet to come. But for all the expectations for Grimmson (Ingvar Sigurdsson) to be a dominant character here, nothing really comes of his quest to kill Credence Barebone (Ezra Miller) and he disappears into the background. The character of Credence is revealed at the finale to be a Dumbledore, and the only one capable of killing his brother Albus (Jude Law), obviously necessary for the titled villain Grindelwald (Johnny Depp) to effect his plan to rule over both the wizard world and humans. That much is known, though the plot thread involving Leta Lestrange (Zoë Kravitz) and the accidental death of her infant brother Corvus is left unresolved, as we don't know the identity of the baby that Corvus was switched with. Who thinks Corvus might actually still be alive? Seems to me there's room in the mythology here to come up with something to make things even more convoluted down the road. I'll check in again, but quite honestly can't remember things from one film to the next, thereby suggesting I should watch a series like this all in a row to keep things straight. If that's even a possibility."", '""Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald"" was what I expected. A lot of CGI. So much, in fact, that it was sometimes hard to tell what I was looking at. I haven\'t read the Fantastic Beasts books - and probably never will, considering how long it takes me to get through a book - so this is my exposure to that franchise. The cast turns the characters into some cool individuals, but the movie can\'t get seen as anything deeply intellectual. Even so, it\'s neat to see the early days of the Harry Potter universe. Enjoyable for its run time, just don\'t expect anything profound.', ""The first in the prequel series to the wizarding world of Harry Potter was very good, I was looking forward to another movie and seeing where it would go next, screenplay by creator J.K. Rowling, directed by David Yates (Harry Potter: Order of the Phoenix, Half-Blood Prince, Deathly Hallows Parts 1 & 2; The Legend of Tarzan). Basically set in 1927, the powerful dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald (Johnny Depp) is being transferred by the Magical Congress of the United States of America (MACUSA) from their maximum security prison to New York City to be tried in London for his various crimes. While departing, Grindelwald is freed by Abernathy (Kevin Guthrie), his follower and a MACUSA employee, Grindelwald kills the guards and escapes using the transfer carriage. Three months later, Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) is appealing to restore his international travel rights to the Ministry of Magic, they were revoked following his visit to New York City. Whilst there, he meets with Leta Lestrange (Zoë Kravitz), an old Hogwarts classmate now engaged to his Auror brother, Theseus (Callum Turner). The Ministry offers to restore Newt's travel rights on one condition, if he will work for them, alongside Theseus, to locate the Obscurial Credence Barebone (Ezra Miller), who has been seen in Paris, France. There are suspicions that Credence is Leta's long-lost brother, Corvus Lestrange, the last of a long line of pure-blood wizards, and Grindelwald believes Credence is the only person who can kill Hogwarts Professor Albus Dumbledore (Jude Law). Newt doesn't want to choose sides and declines, so the Auror Grimmson (Ingvar Eggert Sigurðsson) is sent instead. Dumbledore meets with Newt after he leaves the Ministry, he asks him to locate Credence. Newt returns home to discover his American friends, Queenie Goldstein (Alison Sudol) and Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler) have unexpectedly arrived. The MACUSA's 1926 citywide Obliviation order erased Muggles' bad memories, most of Jacob's memories were good, so he remembers most previous events. Queenie says that she and Jacob have been following her sister Tina (Katherine Waterston) to Europe, Tina is in Paris searching for Credence. Queenie also mentions that Tina thinks Newt is to be married to Leta Lestrange after seeing reports in the newspaper, but Newt has been confused for Theseus. Jacobis brought out of an enchantment spell, put on him by Queenie, they squabble about the marriage ban between wizards and muggles. Queenie is upset and leaves to find Tina, Newt and Jacob decide to go together to Paris to reconcile with the women. In Paris, Tina searches for Credence at a wizarding freak show at the Circus Arcanus, he causes a distraction and escapes, along with circus attraction Nagini (Claudia Kim) who can transform herself into a snake. Credence and Nagini search for his birth mother, they find the servant who put him up for adoption, then Grimmson, revealed to be working for Grindelwald, arrives and kills her. Meanwhile, Tina meets Yusuf Kama (William Nadylam) who is also searching for Credence. Newt and Jacob catch up with Yusuf and Tina, Yusuf explains that he made an Unbreakable Vow to kill Credence, he believes he is his step-brother and the last of the Lestrange family. Newt and Tina enter the French Ministry of Magic searching for documents that confirm Credence's identity, but they are discovered by Leta and Theseus. Newt and Tina reconcile after he explains the false reports, their search for information about Credence leads them to the Lestrange family tomb. Yusuf explains to Leta that they have the same mother, and Leta reveals that she unintentionally killed her infant brother, the child was therefore not Credence. However, things have been fabricated to lead Credence to the tomb. Grindelwald is holding a rally for his followers, it is there that Jacob finds Queenie. At the rally, Grindelwald preaches freedom from laws forcing wizards to remain hidden from muggles, and he shows future images from the forthcoming World War II to call for worldwide wizard supremacy and domination. Theseus leads Aurors to surround the rally, but Grindelwald turns his followers against them and sends them across Europe to spread his message. Grindelwald casts a circle of blue flame to divide followers from enemies, those who oppose are vaporised. Despite protests from Nagini and Jacob, Credence and Queenie cross the line to join him. Leta appears to swear allegiance, but sacrifices herself to attack Grindelwald, giving Newt, Tina, Jacob, Yusuf, Nagini, and Theseus the chance to escape. Grindelwald escapes, while the remaining heroes, alongside the immortal alchemist Nicolas Flamel (Brontis Jodorowsky), stop the blue flame and save Paris. Newt realises he must join the fight against Grindelwald, he and the others travel to Hogwarts where Newt presents Dumbledore with a vial he secretly stole from Grindelwald. The vial contains a blood pact made between Dumbledore and Grindelwald, the two wizards were friends many years before, Newt surmises that this prevents them from duelling each other, Dumbledore believes it may be possible to destroy the pact. In Austria, at his Nurmengard base, Grindelwald tells Credence his true identity as Aurelius Dumbledore, Albus' long-lost brother and the only person powerful enough to kill him. Also starring Ólafur Darri Ólafsson as Skender and Fiona Glascott as Minerva McGonagall. Redmayne is still good as the eccentric magizoologist, Fogler is still likeable as the good-natured Muggle, Depp gets more time (looking a bit like David Bowie) as the villain, Miller is fine, and Law is well cast as the younger wise wizard (not yet headmaster). I will admit the story and pacing is a little uneven at times, but you get swept in the action with terrific chase and fight sequences, the magical special effects are great, and it is wonderful to have a return to Hogwarts castle, this certainly sets you up for what's to come next, a fun fantasy adventure. Very good!"", 'I watched this at home on DVD from my public library. My wife started with me but left midway, she never got immersed in the story.In fact a ""story"" is not easy to find. The movie contains lots of ""magic"" and various fantasy beasts, some flying, some swimming. Grindelwald seems to be an untrustworthy magician, and a real rascal, and Johnny Depp plays him very well. It seems they want him dead but he is not easy to get rid of and the final scenes leave clues to the next installment.In my review 2 years ago of ""Fantastic beasts"" I wrote, ""I really enjoyed the various Harry Potter movies, their stories were more clearly presented, but this movie, while mostly entertaining, is not that special."" And I can say pretty much the same thing for this one. It was mostly fun to watch but not a movie that I would ever want to see again.', ""You can't blame JK Rowling for wanting to keep the 'Harry Potter' saga going, especially on film, but this sequel falls a bit flat.The first 'Fantastic Beasts' film, while not being great in any shape or form, at least told a good story, one that could have stood alone, and there were some good performances.This one however tries to do way too much - set up future instalments (do we really need 5 of these films as is anticipated??) introduce us to all the key players who may or may not be useful in these future films, while also providing enough links back to 'Harry Potter' to please the fans.In the end it does none of these convincingly, and ends up being an odd, quite dark film that doesn't live up to its billing."", ""The visuals are great, but there is no story. The film is just a collage of scenes with strange creatures appearing for no reason at all. The vast number of characters don't help to make the plot any easier to decipher. The only scenes that I enjoyed are the ones in Hogwarts. That's because at least I know what they are about."", 'A decent sequel and worthy addition to the wizarding world. The characters were well cast and decent acting. Storyline unfolded in a interesting way but was a bit disjointed.', '. . . a few movies back, she\'s seemed obsessed--at least on a subconscious level--with the Dire Days of America\'s Defection to the Dark Side. This is understandable, since the flicks emanate from the USA\'s always eponymous Warner Bros., who cannot help themselves from warning about America\'s upcoming Calamities, Catastrophes, Cataclysms, and Apocalypti. In Hogwart\'s version of Reality, as in Today\'s U.S., a titanic struggle persists between a strong Death Eater Party and a much weaker and more loosely organized band who fancy themselves to be the ""Good Guys."" Warner warns us that whether we call this latter force ""America\'s intelligence community"" or the ""Aurors of the Ministry of Magic,"" these ineffectual bozos will always show up a day late and a dollar short until they grow a pair. It does not make much difference how much movie make-up and hair styling is used to make ""Grindelwald"" a dead ringer for the U.S. Oval Office Occupant if no one is willing to step in when Aurors are being massacred or American resident journalists are being tortured and chopped into little pieces in Saudi embassies. With FANTASTIC BEASTS: THE CRIMES OF GRINDELWALD Warner Bros. is warning us to strip the rabid base of ""core supporters"" of their citizenship, wealth, and assets under the Benedict Arnold, RICO Organized Crime, and Civil Forfeiture laws and permanently deport them to an escape-proof holding center in Antarctica. If we wait for the Ministry of Magic to do this, Freedom flies out our window for the next 3,000 years.', 'Greetings again from the darkness. It\'s been seven years since the final Harry Potter movie, and this is the second entry in the planned series of 5 prequels entitled FANTASTIC BEASTS, based on a (fictional) Hogwarts\' textbook written by Magizoologist Newt Scamander (played by Eddie Redmayne). Of course the characters and stories are from the pen of J.K. Rowling, and who better to bring us the war pitting pure-blood wizards against Muggles?FANTASTIC BEASTS AND WHERE TO FIND THEM was released in 2016, and it was mostly an introduction to these characters and to some of the cutest and oddest creatures we\'d ever encountered on screen. This second entry is much darker and more sinister, and tries to develop quite a few characters ... perhaps too many. On top of the roster of players, romantic complications abound, and a search for one\'s roots/identity is yet another sub-plot. And then there\'s that whole Nazi element - leaving us all a bit bewildered at trying to keep up (although, it is fun trying).David Yates directed the last four Harry Potter movies, and now the first two Fantastic Beasts films. He kicks this one off with a spectacular action sequence featuring a black carriage being drawn by a team of majestic flying dragons during a driving rain storm ... all part of a daring 1927 prison escape by the titular Grindewald (Johnny Depp with a bleach punk do). It\'s a breathtaking sequence, and the best of many visual wonders throughout - including my favorite, a very cool statue effect and a fabulous kelp seahorse.Most of the key players return from the first film, though, as previously mentioned, their stories are more elaborate. Eddie Redmayne returns as Newt, our main guide through this universe. Katherine Waterston is back as auror and fringy love interest Tina, Alison Sudol returns as Tina\'s mind-reading sister Queenie, and Dan Fogler resumes his comic relief duties as Jacob. Jude Law is Albus Dumbledore (yes, the first name is needed), and he is prevented from fighting Gindewald (Depp) due to some youthful ""bonding"" that occurred years prior. Zoe Kravitz is Leta Lestrange, Carmen Ejogo is Seraphina Picquery, and Ezra Miller is the lost soul Credence Barebone. Newly introduced characters include Claudia Kim as shapeshifter Nagini, Callum Turner as Newt\'s brother Theseus, and Brontis Jodorowsky (son of renowned cult director Alejandro Jadorowsky, EL TOPO) as non-ghost Flamel. If that\'s not enough characters to track, you should know the story skips from New York to London to Paris and back around again.Expect some happy gasps from the audience as Hogwarts is revisited, but the darkness and similarities to Nazi beginnings may surprise those expecting two hours of cutesy creatures springing from Newt\'s coat ... although, those exist as well. We do learn that \'salamander eyes\' are not to be used while flirting, and it will be quite interesting to see how these stories close in to the Harry Potter world over the next 3 prequel-sequels (scheduled through 2024). It should be a fun ride - though not as fun as riding that seahorse.', 'For years I\'ve heard about how IMAX offers a high-quality option to see the latest blockbuster, but due to having only read about the one in London, I assumed none were near me. Making plans to go Christmas shopping in Manchester, I found out that there was an IMAX at the Vue in The Print Works, which was getting a major upgrade with the brand new ""IMAX Laser"" format, this led to me booking a ticket for the first film to be played in the screening room.View on the film:Toning down the Steam Punk appearance of the first film which allowed it to stand (somewhat) separate from its roots, returning director David Yates & cinematographer Philippe Rousselot replace it with more of a delve into Harry Potter style Fantasy Action set-pieces, which whilst offering moments of magical thrills (Yates makes excellent use of the IMAX format to give the beasts a huge, towering appearance) does end up becoming the cliché brash blue lights in the sky. Appearing to have a tighter grip on the series, the screenplay by J.K. Rowling surprisingly feels half-finished, with Rowling offering tantalising set-ups (from illegal globe-trotting in a bucket, to ""real life"" events of the sinking of the Titanic and WWII being the first time real events have appeared in the Potter franchise) only to leave them hanging unfinished.Pushing all else aside to fill in background of Potter mythology, Rowling does well at giving a heaviness from history in the blood bond between Grindelwald and Dumbledore, but in spending all this focus on characters from Potter, makes those from Fantastic Beasts have little impact on unfolding events. Returning with a dapper Eddie Redmayne, Katherine Waterston and Dan Fogler continue giving the best turns of the series as alluring Goldstein and gee wiz Kowalski, whilst Johnny Depp dabbles being a creep,as Grindlewald reveals his crimes.', ""This sequel is of the same level as the first movie. It's a bit of entertainment, for the whole family, with some good CGI moments. If you don't like fantasy movies with weird creatures and alot of CGI's then you shouldn't watch this one because that's basically the whole movie. The story is okay, just a bit more complicated than the first movie, but still a movie to watch with the whole family, kids included. The acting is okay from most of the actors excepted from the main character Newt Scamander played by Eddie Redmayne. To me he's just a mediocre actor but that's my opinion. Like in the first movie he's the weakest link and both movies could have been better with another actor."", ""For a movie called Fantastic Beasts, there are few of them and not relevant to the plot at all. Instead, a lot of characters fumbling in confusion in order to get to the bottom of Credence's identity. Magic is ubiquitous, but feels more like technology in this film that doesn't feel magic, only CGI. Meanwhile Grindelwald plays the role of a politician in a world of idiots and every other character acts completely different from their actual role.Why can't women cast anything serious? Men do everything and women are helpless. Why can't Aurors cast anything serious? I mean, they're supposed to be trained for it. Why must a lot of people die before the others consider casting a counter spell? Who can take seriously someone who spouts accusations of persecution from authorities then proceeds on destroying Paris? Who is everybody in this film? Where did they come from? Why should I care? All these are questions that you will find no answer to in this film.The special effects are great, the actors did a good job, even Depp, who seems to be half asleep most of the time, but the plot is a total mess and has no roots and goes nowhere. My suggestion is, if you want to watch the film, wait until the next one(s) are released and watch them in order, starting with the first Fantastic Beasts, otherwise you will understand nothing."", ""In some ways, 'Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes Of Grindelwald (2018)' is more cohesive - or, at least, consistent - than its predecessor, especially when it comes to tone. The issue is that it's just more consistently dull, both in terms of visuals (including dark, muddy cinematography and difficult-to-watch, CG-based action-scenes) and story. It's almost exactly as structurally unsound, to boot, with the entire affair focusing on the filler-feeling side-plot of the first without much thought given to the more successful, actual 'fantastic beast'-based stuff that this series is now, somewhat erroneously, forever named upon. It seems like a feature-length 'B story' with only mere moments of entertainment, a few fleeing glimpses of interesting character interactions and surprisingly dark back-stories, and a whole heap of fan-service filled, sequel-bait set-up that makes the entire affair feel, ultimately, entirely pointless. It's just a simple, essentially skippable stepping stone in a slow-paced and, in itself, inconsequential story that we already know the outcome of. It seems that the real magic is the way that it somehow leaves you with the bitter taste of disappointment even though you didn't expect it to be any good in the first place. 4/10"", 'It\'s hard for me to say this is that much worse than the first movie. but i went into it unenthusiastically, and i lost interest within the first 10 minutes. half-paid attention for the rest of the movie with most of it on fast speed. the ""cool"" magic stuff really isn\'t for me. i could tell some of the CGI was amazing, but it didn\'t please me like it does in so many other movies. this series is outside of my taste range. it may also be a bad movie, but i didn\'t give it enough of a chance to say that confidently (1 viewing)', ""I've been waiting for ages for this film. Literally loved it,those special effects,plot. The best movie of 2018."", 'I generally hate writing a review about a movie/tv episode that I hate. It feels like a waste of energy, especially knowing that there are plenty of people out there who genuinely enjoy this film series, but I\'m just not one of them. I LOVE the Harry Potter movies and grew up with those 8 films, but I\'ve never felt the connection to the Fantastic Beasts series that I did to Potter. It\'s not necessarily fair to make that comparison but alas, there\'s virtually nothing good about the Crimes of Grindelwald. Confusing, convoluted, and at times way too convenient for its own good, the film has nothing to grapple onto emotionally. In fact, the one decent thing about the first film (Queenie and Jacob) is entirely ruined in this film\'s third act. Disappointingly, the film has almost pushed aside the beasts side of the series completely, in exchange for a cliched villain with Grindelwald, who severely lacks in originality. Admittedly, I found myself lost for most of the runtime. Until they inevitably put out ""Cursed Child"" in 15 years, this may be it for me with this universe.2.3/10', 'For a film about magic, Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald is sure lacking it. This sequel to the spin-off features too many characters, an overly complicated plot and blurry, choppy action sequences that makes it impossibly difficult to follow. The dark and brooding tone made me miss the whimsy of the Harry Potter series. What has happened to the Wizarding World?', ""New York, 1927Notorious dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald (Johnny Depp) is being imprisoned by the American Ministry of Magic. MACUSA President Seraphina Picquery (Carmen Ejogo) oversees Grindelwald as he is being transferred to London with one of her employees, Abernathy (Kevin Guthrie). As they become airborne in a carriage pulled by Thestrals, it becomes apparent that Grindelwald and Abernathy have switched places, as Abernathy has always been loyal to Grindelwald. Abernathy fills the carriage with water while Grindelwald diverts the Thestrals' path. They kill two guards, while a third, Spielman (Wolf Roth), survives his fall. Grindelwald then proceeds to head out and find the rest of his followers.LondonNewt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) is being prepped for a hearing with the British Ministry of Magic. He meets with an old Hogwarts' friend, Leta Lestrange (Zoe Kravitz), who is engaged to Newt's brother Theseus (Callum Turner), with whom Newt has a bit of a strained relationship. Newt enters the meeting to have his right to travel reinstated after the events that took place in New York when Newt's beasts were loose and the Obscurial Credence Barebone (Ezra Miller) wreaked havoc. Although Newt believed Credence to be dead, he is told that Credence is alive and has resurfaced in Paris. Newt is given a chance to get his travel rights back under the condition that he works under Theseus at the Ministry to help find Credence since they know that Grindelwald is trying to find him and lure him to his side, but Newt refuses to work with his brother. An Auror named Grimmson (Ingvar Eggert Sigurosson) takes on the task, though he appears to have sinister intentions.Grindelwald and his followers meet in a private residence to discuss going off to find Credence. In another room next to them, they find a male toddler who can't yet comprehend what is going on. Grindelwald has one of his followers, Carrow (Maja Bloom), use the Killing Curse on him.Newt leaves the Minstry building and finds a glove tapping him and pointing at him to meet on top of a building. He grabs the glove and is apparated to meet with his former professor, the great Albus Dumbledore (Jude Law). They meet privately as Dumbledore also tasks Newt with going off to find Credence in Paris since he may be in danger or be a danger to others. He also leaves Newt with a card with an address for a safe house in Paris. Newt is reluctant to take on this mission, but Dumbledore informs him that it must be him since Dumbledore cannot move against Grindelwald.Newt returns home to his assistant Bunty (Victoria Yeates), who has scrapes on her arm after handling his Kelpie (like a giant magic seahorse). After dealing with baby Nifflers and the Kelpie, he hears a noise coming from his room. To Newt's surprise, he finds Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler) and Queenie Goldstein (Alison Sudol) in his room, having apparated all the way from New York. Newt is surprised that Jacob remembers him despite being Obliviated, but Jacob explains that Queenie filled him in on the bad things. Newt is also disappointed to hear that Tina (Katherine Waterston) is not there and has been seeing another Auror after a mistake in a magazine led her to believe that Newt was engaged to Leta instead of Theseus. Newt quickly discovers that Queenie has enchanted Jacob to make him love her, and she reluctantly allows Newt to remove the enchantment. Although a bit displeased at being bewitched, Jacob follows Queenie as she leaves Newt's place to tell her she didn't need to use magic on him because he already loved her. However, they get into an argument due to the laws against magical folk being in relationships with muggles/no-majes. Queenie reads Jacob's mind and hears him call her crazy, so she leaves him. He returns to Newt's place and joins him as they head to Paris.In Paris, we find Credence working at a freak show under the cruel ringmaster Skender (Olafur Dari Olafsson). Credence is close to Nagini (Claudia Kim), a young woman who is a Maledictus, meaning she is cursed to transform into a snake until one day when the transformation becomes permanent (she will later become Voldemort's pet snake). Skender puts on a show for people to have Nagini shapeshift for them, with Tina in attendance. Credence lets loose a bunch of small creatures that create sparks, leading to chaos in the tent. This allows Credence to get away with Nagini while Tina tries to contain the situation. Skender just takes everything with him and gets out. As Tina walks away, she is found by Yusuf Kama (William Nadylam), who was also in attendance at the show. He talks to Tina and tells her that he is looking for Credence. Yusuf tells Tina he is the last of a pure-blood line, as is Credence.Grindelwald knows where Credence is headed, to find his birth mother. He plans to use the boy in eliminating Dumbledore.Newt and Jacob take a Portkey to Paris since it's the only way Newt can travel out of the country discreetly. Once they get there, Newt uses a spell to detect Tina's last movements in the area so that he can trace her location, as well as Yusuf's. Meanwhile, Queenie is also in Paris to find Tina. She goes to the French Ministry of Magic for a lead, but gets no help. At the same time, Abernathy and another Grindelwald follower, Rosier (Poppy Corby-Tuech) are lurking in the same building. Queenie is outside the building and overhears Newt and Jacob walking by her. She attempts to follow them but is overwhelmed when she starts to hear everyone's thoughts. Queenie is then found by Rosier, who invites her to join her.Credence and Nagini arrive at the home of Irma Dugard (Danielle Hugues), the woman Credence was led to believe is his mother. She turns out to only be the nurse who delivered Credence and wrote her name on the documents. Irma embraces Credence moments before they are found by Grimmson. He fires a blast that kills Irma. Credence becomes enraged and takes on his Obscurial form, attempting to attack Grimmson, but he shields himself from Credence's moves, though Credence still manages to destroy most of the house. Credence and Nagini get away, and Grimmson goes to report on what he saw to Grindelwald.Newt and Jacob find Yusuf on the streets. They approach him and ask if he has seen Tina. Yusuf guides the two to a cell where he has imprisoned Tina, and does so with Newt and Jacob as well. Outside, a Zouwu (a large cat-like creature) is on the loose. The three manage to free themselves and subdue Yusuf so that Newt can go out and lure the Zouwu with a toy and keep him in his briefcase with the other fantastic beasts.At Hogwarts, Dumbledore's Defense Against The Dark Arts class is interrupted by Torquil Travers (Derek Riddell) from the British Ministry. Dumbledore sends his students out with Professor McGonnagall (Fiona Glascott). Travers tasks Dumbledore with taking down Grindelwald. He knows that the two of them were once close like brothers, though Dumbledore states they were closer than that. When Dumbledore says he cannot fight Grindelwald, Travers tells him he can no longer teach DATDA. Dumbledore later finds the Mirror of Erised and sees himself and Grindelwald as younger men making an Unbreakable Vow.We catch up with Leta and see a flashback from her days at Hogwarts (here played by Thea Lamb) where she was bullied by other students, so she in turn curses them in ways such as making a girl's mouth disappear. She and Newt (here played by Joshua Shea) were each other's only friends, and he would take the blame for her wrongdoings. While in Dumbledore's DATDA class, the students are handling a Boggart (the being that shows people what they fear most). It turns into a desk for Newt since his worst fear is working in an office, but for Leta, it turns into a white sheet holding something inside. Afterwards, Newt shows Leta a tree where he finds Bowtruckles that have come to trust him. Back in the present, Dumbledore finds Leta. She asks him if he considered her as bad as the others did. He says no, and she replies that he is the only one who didn't see her as such.Rosier brings Queenie to the hideout where she comes face-to-face with Grindelwald. Although Queenie is prepared to defend herself against him, he calmly speaks to her and entices her when bringing up the matter of loving who she wants to love.Newt, Tina, and Jacob take an unconscious Yusuf back to his place. Tina wants to question Yusuf since he might know the truth about Credence. They look into his eyes and see a parasite in there. Newt and Tina manage to pull it out. Tina plans to take back her information to the Ministry, appearing to still be agitated with Newt over not telling her about him and Leta. Newt explains the confusion from what she read. Just then, they look up at the sky and see what look like black drapes sweeping across the sky, indicating that Grindelwald is summoning his followers. Newt and Tina plan to go to the French Ministry to find a box that contains the truth about Credence, while Grindelwald finds Credence and Nagini to try and lure them to his side.Jacob is left alone in the house where he meets the famed alchemist Nicolas Flamel (Brontis Jodorowsky). He shows Jacob a crystal ball where he sees the whereabouts of Credence and Queenie. Flamel tells Jacob that Queenie is going to be at a cemetery in Paris. As Jacob is heading out to leave, he notices that Yusuf is gone. Flamel then goes into his closet (where he just so happens to be keeping the Sorcerer's Stone) and takes out a book to talk to a woman named Eulalie Hicks (Jessica Williams), as he knows that Grindelwald is rallying his followers at the cemetery, and he fears there will be death.Newt uses Polyjuice Potion to disguise himself as Theseus to get inside the Ministry. They enter the records room and also take a moment to almost express their mutual feelings for one another. Theseus spots Newt and goes after him and Tina. As they hide, they overhear Leta reading a note saying that Lestrange family records have been moved to their family tomb. Leta finds Newt and Tina, and the records keeper finds them and sics her Matagots (creepy panther-like beasts) after Leta tries to defend herself against them. Newt brings the Zouwu out and it helps them escape.Newt, Tina, and Leta come across Credence, Nagini, and Yusuf. Yusuf reveals that he has been looking for Credence because he wants to kill him, as Yusuf's mother Laurena (Isaura Barbe-Brown) was taken against her will by Corvus Lestrange Sr (Keith Chanter) under the Imperius curse, who impregnated her with a child before she ultimately died. That child was Leta. Corvus Sr remarried and had another child, Corvus Jr, Leta's half-brother, whom Yusuf believes Credence to be. However, Leta says that Corvus Jr is dead because she was the one who killed him. As a child, she was on a boat with Irma, and the baby Corvus would not stop crying. Leta switched him with a quiet, sleeping baby just before the ship started to sink. Leta was on one lifeboat with the other baby, while Corvus was on a different lifeboat that capsized, and he drowned as a result (this is the form that the Boggart took for Leta). Leta has lived with this guilt ever since.As part of his plan, everyone heads to the cemetery where Grindelwald has gathered his followers and set up for Credence to go to him. Jacob finds Queenie, who invites him to join and watch what Grindelwald has to say. The dark wizard preaches about their supremacy over non-magic folks. He shows them future images of World War II to show just how flawed the non-magic community is and how they will only bring their own world into ruins. Theseus leads Ministry Aurors there to stop them, along with Newt, Tina, Yusuf, Leta, Flamel, and Travers. Grindelwald's followers get away just as he creates a Protego Diabolica spell that spreads a powerful blue flame with a dragon-like form to spread across Paris. Several wizards are killed in the fire as the Aurors attempt to stop it. Grindelwald calls for new followers to join him. Credence decides to join, despite Nagini trying to pull him away. Queenie does so as well, even trying to get Jacob to go with her, but he cannot bring himself to do so and watches as Queenie leaves with him. Leta appears to try and join Grindelwald, but she instead makes an attempt to kill him. Grindelwald ends up burning her to ashes, to the horror of Newt and Theseus. Grindelwald disapparates with Credence and Queenie. The Aurors then manage to stop the fire from spreading. Newt then embraces Theseus as they mourn Leta.Newt takes a vial of blood that his Niffler nicked off of Grindelwald and brings it to Dumbledore at Hogwarts. This blood pact is the reason that Dumbledore cannot fight Grindelwald, as this is their Unbreakable Vow. Dumbledore tells Newt that he may be able to destroy it.Grindelwald brings Credence and Queenie to a new hideout. He tells Credence his true name: Aurelius Dumbledore, making him Albus' brother. Grindelwald tells Credence that only he can destroy Dumbledore. Credence then tests out the strength of his power by blasting the side of a mountain.""]"
