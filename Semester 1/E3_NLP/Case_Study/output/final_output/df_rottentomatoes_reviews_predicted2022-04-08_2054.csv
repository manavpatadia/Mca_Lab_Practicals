"2019's Godzilla: King of the Monsters, does prove that you can have too much of a good thing, however many people, myself included, love it simply because it's what we've wanted to see since we were children, and after the incredibly lifeless 2014 Godzilla, this was a massive improvement in terms of sheer entertainment.  Now, this is NOT a great movie by almost any other metric -- The CGI is good but uneven, the action solid but not quite spectacular, the story is fun but dumb, the dialogue fun but really dumb, the pacing quick but perhaps too quick, and the set-pieces so big that they clearly didn't have the budget to make them longer.  But as a lifelong Godzilla fan, this movie was the movie what I wanted to see with both the 1998 and 2014 movies, and was disappointed when both completely failed to even ATTEMPT it, let alone managed to achieve it.  Godzilla is actually a MUCH better character in this movie than he was in 2014 (where he was just a big and tough lizard), and it's amazing how they infused intelligence into Rodan, Mothra and King Ghidorah, the last of which is the most impressive, as each head is given a different personality, and one even being, more or less, ""the dumb one"".  Things did settle down with Godzilla vs Kong, a less-thrilling but objectively better-crafted film, but this was certainly a lot of fun while it lasted, and any fan of Showa and/or Heisei Godzilla NEEDS to see this movie!",godzilla_king_of_the_monsters_2019,MonsterVerse,MonsterVerse,2,2,MonsterVerse,2,MonsterVerse,2,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,MonsterVerse,2,MonsterVerse,2

"An entertaining film with a great villain and a new, different and creative take on Spider-Man's character. Tom Holland is good enough in the role.

"Captain America: Civil War goes a darker direction than previous Captain America films by introduing a political conflict between the members of The Avengers instead of an out of Earth menace or an evil genius, I think this movie could have been marketed under The Avengers name but for some reason they decided not to, maybe because it was too soon.

"King of the Monsters, for me, is a big letdown from it's two predecessors in the MonsterVerse and lacks the finesse in the writing, directing and acting that those two movies had and is the only movie to date in the MonsterVerse that I dislike. KotM doesn't have a great story, something that the characters in the movie actually recognize and act based upon. This entire movie is founded on one character causing a global catastrophe because their plan didn't go according to plan, meaning the entire movie was avoidable which makes it feel a bit pointless. In other words, the whole premise of the movie is founded in character stupidity, which really hurts the story and development of the plot. In essence, the fates that certain characters have could've been avoided and the global catastrophe that happens could've been averted. The way that a lot of the characters act based on all of this is actually pretty smart and they do the best they can to get the situation under control. The acting, however, isn't great and makes some moments and scenes feel really off and awkward. Certain lines feel exaggerated which hurts their delivery in the movie, as though they were said improperly or over acted. The kaiju action, however, is great just as it was in the first two movies, which is one redeeming quality of this movie. Watching the big monsters fight each other is entertaining enough to keep viewers somewhat engaged for the full runtime, but the lack of a cohesive story and plot really hampers the movie from reaching the heights of Godzilla and Skull Island. There are (spoiler alert) a bunch of other big monsters that appear in this movie, but they don't seem to do too much for the movie and feel like a hugely missed opportunity. Despite how many of them there are, they feel inconsequential to the progress and development of the movie and the focus really seems to be on Godzilla and Ghidorah. I do like that the humans are given the opportunity to get involved in the fight and lend a helping hand, which they actually do in a bigger way in this movie than they did in any other movie in the MonsterVerse at the time this movie came out. I appreciated this a lot as it shows that sometimes, even the big monsters need some help. Humans play a huge role in this movie, giving it a human-centric perspective which is also nice and another redeeming quality of the movie. Unfortunately, these two highlights aren't enough the save this movie from being a trainwreck compared to the other ones. I don't like the ending too much, since despite the fact that Godzilla (spoiler alert) comes out victorious, it's really only because of the help that the humans gave him. This movie doesn't live up to it's title since Godzilla got his ass beaten in his first two encounters with Ghidorah and likely wouldn't have won the third time either without major assistance due to how powerful Ghidorah is. Godzilla feels like a false, or a rigged, king in this movie which makes the end feel unsatisfying and disappointing. Despite some promise and good moments, KotM falters in huge ways and isn't a great installment in the MonsterVerse.",godzilla_king_of_the_monsters_2019,MonsterVerse,MonsterVerse,2,2,MonsterVerse,2,MonsterVerse,2,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,MonsterVerse,2,MonsterVerse,2

"Directed by the brothers Anthony and Joe Russo; ""Avengers: Endgame"" went out in 2019, being the penultimate movie of the third MCU's phase. Starring some of the biggest Hollywood actors like Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans or Scarlett Johansson, the ,181 minutes long, movie is based on a Stan Lee story. The film took places just after Avengers Infinity War where 50% of the world's population has died. The rest of the superhero group ""Avengers"" tried to finally beat the bad guy Thanos. The Plot can look Utterly complicated but in fact, with all the others MCU movie all take Sens and the plot looks way better and perfectly made. In facts they used all the characters well and give them all a custom end. I loved that movie and in my way it's a stunning, amusing and fast-paced film. The acting is also highly impressive, and the ending is outstanding: it gives goosebumps. We feel the giant budget and it has been used very well when we see the specials effects which are also outstanding. To conclude I'll say that the filming techniques are superb like the close plan at the end or the panorama plans to see all the army. And the photography looks profoundly elaborate as the luminosity or the settings.  So I recommend it as well without hesitation.",avengers_endgame,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,DC Extended Universe,0
"Really enjoyed the first two films, both contained great scenes/action, acting and the two best villains of the films. Was mixed on the third film, which wasn't that bad but suffered mainly from bloat, and was not totally sold on the 'Amazing Spider-Man' films.

Whether 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' is the best 'Spider-Man' film ever is debatable, some may prefer the first two films, others may prefer this. To me, it is the best 'Spider-Man' film since the second and on par with the first two. It may not have taken as many risks or had sequences/action as memorable as the first two films, and for more of an origin story it's best to stick with the first two films. For a fresh twist on 'Spider-Man' and the superhero genre, 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' (one of Marvel's best to date) more than fits the bill.

'Spider-Man: Homecoming' is not quite the masterpiece as proclaimed to me and maybe not quite as good as the acclaim, but personally can totally see why it is loved so much and that it deserves all the positivity it's received. It has a couple of faults, Liz is a bland and underwritten character and Laura Harrier does nothing with the character. Flash also could have been much more intimidating in demeanour and physicality, for a bully one is not intimidated, pretty anaemic actually and even annoying at times.

Much more could have been done with Spider-Man's powers and how he got around, they could have been better used, being not used enough, and of better quality.

However, 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' looks great. Slick, stylish with bold, atmospheric use of colour and mostly top-notch special effects. Michael Giacchino pens yet another winner of a music score, both rousing and hypnotic with also an intensity and emotional undercurrent.

It's a remarkably well scripted film too. It has some hilarious and rarely forced humour (namely from Ned and Michelle, both of whom should have been annoying but were refreshing scene-stealing comic relief), poignancy and tension. The story works well as a superhero story, with great chemistry between Peter and Tony Stark and a terrific scene in a car with our hero and Vulture, and even more so as an affectionate and easy to relate to coming of age and trying-to-fit-in story. The action is kept at minimum but what there is is fun and suspenseful, even if there were sequences and climaxes more memorable in the first two films.

A risk was taken having Jon Watts in the director's chair, but luckily inexperience doesn't show, there is a great sense of visual style and momentum is kept taut. A great cast also helps, with Tom Holland doing a wonderful job in the complex dual role, both roles are easy to relate to and he differentiates the two personalities of nerdy, awkward high school deadline and charismatic head-line-making superhero with remarkable ease.

Michael Keaton, fresh from giving two of his best performances in years in 'Birdman' and 'Spotlight', is also superb as Vulture, a refreshingly different and more complex villain than most Marvel villains, a menacing villain but with a humane side with a far less generic motivation than one would find in other Marvel films and doesn't feel underused. A villain that one is intimidated by but also feel sorry for. Marissa Tomei seemed bizarre casting on paper but she is very charming actually and fits well.

Robert Downey Jnr brings charismatic intensity and authority to Tony Stark, Jon Favreau is fun while Jacob Batalon and Zendaya are refreshing comic relief.

Overall, very good, often great and very nearly outstanding (which it would have been if more care was given to a few of the supporting characters). 8/10 Bethany Cox",spider_man_homecoming,Marvel Cinematic Universe,DC Extended Universe,1,0,DC Extended Universe,0,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,DC Extended Universe,0,DC Extended Universe,0
"Godzilla vs Kong is ultimately probably the best of the Trilogy.  While King of the Monsters gave me what I wanted, it was a bit unwieldly in its execution, perfectly executing the ""Too much of a good thing.."" idiom, and featuring some wildly inconsistent CGI and semi-inconsistent tones.  Godzilla vs Kong, however, is better in these regards by simply being a more refined movie, with most of its overenthusiasm for its own existent well-contained this time, making this feel more like an actual Movie rather than just cinematic Wish-Fulfillment on the part of the Filmmakers.  Additionally, the CGI is notably sharper (likely because there don't appear to be as many full-CG sequences) and the cinematography is notably better as well.  One thing I also found legitimately interesting is that the movie doesn't show Godzilla much, but instead, he's treated like the Jason Vorhees of the Monsterverse - he is seen only from time to time, but he just causes massive destruction and is not willing to compromise.  This does culminate in 2 great battle sequences between Godzilla and Kong (the first of these two showcasing a great, if somewhat short, Godzilla vs Military sequence as well), and the climax, no spoilers, is pretty awesome.  If you like Kaiju movies, this is a great one, and honestly I liked it more than the original King Kong vs Godzilla.  The only real problem is that Godzilla, despite top billing, is not given nearly as much screentime as Kong, but his presence is well used, so this mostly makes up for it.",godzilla_vs_kong,MonsterVerse,MonsterVerse,2,2,MonsterVerse,2,MonsterVerse,2,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,MonsterVerse,2,MonsterVerse,2
"This film is ok. Jake Gylenhall does a pretty good job as Quentin Beck (even though some of the writing on his character is hilariously bad). Holland steps up as Spider-Man, which is very much appreciated. And we get more Zendaya, which is always a good thing. But the script is so cheesy at time, making the story often feel like it's targeted exclusively at ten year olds, but Mysterio's plan makes no sense and the character's potential isn't really realised to the best extent.

"Marvel Studios' Thor follows the titular character as he evolves from an
arrogant, brash and impetuous boy to a compassionate man who uses his
powers to help others rather than to seek out violence, which is a rich
character arc throughout the movie and was very refreshing to witness.
The first act of the movie was actually quite decent for me as it explored
Asgard and had rich world-building and I was very impressed with the CGI.
However, after Thor gets banished to Earth, the film starts to decrease in
quality as the tone becomes more comedic and the storyline started to
slow down for me. I was very bored with Jane Foster and I didn't feel like
she had any chemistry with Thor at all, and Kat Dennings' character was
especially annoying and made bad jokes which were silly and I did not
laugh, or even smile at any one of them.
The final third act was bland and boring, and Loki was a very bland villain in
this movie, even though he received a lot of character development, which
is a sign of bad execution of a character. Other than Loki, the Frost Giants
had no personality whatsoever and were only a plot device for this movie.
There were some emotional character moments in this film, like when Thor
fails to wield his hammer.

The score for this movie is rich and memorable, and I wish Marvel had more
of these types of scores rather than the generic modern Hans Zimmer-like
music that is throwaway and forgettable.
Overall, this film has a rich character arc but was not well executed and is
only average for me.",thor,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1

"Like the very much anti-imperialist slant Iron Man is somewhat going for, but I do find it a bit confused. Tony Stark realizing his weapons are just propagating the terrorism from home and how the US generates the war effort from weapon manufacturers, but it still has a messy lens from Bush-era politics of intervening still because ""it's personal"", where it seeps in somewhat as a creator mad at its misuse because it's on his conscience (Gulmira is a personal attachment from Yinsen and his weapons are still being misused), rather than a climb to sanity towards the tools of destruction, although it does go a few steps forwards on this, and it's one person rather than the military. Still an imperialist justification innit?

I like how Stark is confronted character wise on his arrogance, but it doesn't get rid of his smarminess and it makes him mostly unlikable for me even with scenes with Pepper that are heartfelt. At least he's called out for it, dumbly trying to right himself and the film exposits it as a messy road with consequences despite his well-intentions (he almost gives Obadiah tools of even bigger destruction if he wasn't there to intervene in the end).

Pepper really showcasing the weird, awkward, and slightly yikes power gap in the relationship of an employer and their employee. I get that the movie lampshades this by having Pepper literally point it out, even trying to close the power gap a bit with how he ""wouldn't even be able to tie his shoes"" without her, giving her quitting more possible weight to the other firing her, but it's still weird!

The few soundtrack choices are excellent (Suicidal Tendencies... perfection), but the score itself is weak as hell. I don't know a single musical score for a film from Ramin Djawadi that was ever any good, the closest being Pacific Rim and that wasn't even all him (Tom Morello helped out on a few notable songs)! Only good stuff is for TV a la Prison Break, Game of Thrones, or Westworld, and the last one is mostly orchestral covers even if they're used well. Maybe it's because he doesn't put up much of a fight with directors like Favreau when it comes to temp tracks in film? Not sure. Still very weak, impossible to note. Even for the scenes' use it's very disappointing, barely adding anything save for the strings coming through in the mix at very predictable times for something ""epic"".

It's so nice to see a film that isn't grey as fuck color grading, but also the nighttime itself isn't that pretty. I don't need CG lens flares but it's too muted for the most part. There are pretty shots like the ""Jericho"" presentation and Iron Man falling down from a tank shot, and the IMAX Enhanced version does add a bit more depth to some shots like the mountains. Not that huge of an improvement, but noticeable! CG is also great for the most part save for some spotty parts in the end (bobbing head with Obadiah), but the Iron Man suit... master class.

I think the film is mostly well shot for action pieces, but other than the last fight and the mass explosions of the weapons at the end of the first act, I wasn't super impressed. Felt like the action was just underbaked in terms of how it's showcased and written, or maybe my bar is too high. It's neat though to see gadget-y things like the targeting in the hostage situation. At least it's not CUT CUT CUT.

For a film that's clearly trying to stay away from an R rating, laughing really hard at the... ""interesting"" POV from the bus in the last fight to look visually stimulating. Iron Man gets hit into the bus, and the cut into the view from the bus gives visual information that somebody is looking outside AT him, implying there are people in there... and then the bus is blown up with no bodies. The explanation comes earlier, there's a scene with people mass evacuating from the bus, but I think it's interesting visual confusion.

Top tier performance from Jeff Bridges. The meme of a box of scraps is probably because it's such a killer performance of the line. I also like RDJ, Paltrow, and Howard, really funny in particular to hear Howard say ""humanitarian"" so loudly, a parallel to Bridges calling the peaceful people ""hippies"", performances really hammering in that point. Bridges is so good in a villainous role.

Breath of fresh air to have a MCU film that isn't wall to wall in quips. My sister pointed out that the quips are mostly from RDJ, while the rest are mostly visual gags like harsh cuts, which is my fav humor in the film tbh. I love the setup-punchline of it (""No I won't be drinking...."" 1 harsh cut later and he's completely drunk), wonder if that's what Favreau is known for. The quips are also characterized, where RDJ is more of reactionary quipping as he's clearly not in full control ever (constantly missing timelines, emotionally wrecked internally, etc.). I don't think quips on their own are bad. Think facing adversity with humor is just a very human thing in general (a la Rhodes with ""how was the Fun-vee?""), but I also think it's better that it's rare instead of all the time.

Frankly would've edited that entire scene of Iron Man saving the military guy with his parachute out of the film. It's tonally confused in the concept of him trying to run away from the military/going rogue by himself, and it barely gets any weight so the payoff is worthless. I'm totally up for superheroes saving the common guy, there's a funny moment after saving the people in Gulmira with leaving the person responsible for gunning them up without his gun, in the middle of a crowd that's absolutely going to do some avenging (hehe), but you can't make the military trying to shoot him and then ""help save me"" the next second.

To sum it up, messy anti-imperialism theming but mostly decent film with a good character direction for Tony Stark.

"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 follows up the story from the first film exactly how it is expected. The film has a better story and a better villain than the first, but character development ends up taking a step back. With the sudden flanderization of the team, the only character to really survive this sudden change is Yondu who gets a lot of good development as a result. The sudden change in Rocket can also be excused as he gets some development to explain it, but no one else really has an explanation to his or her drastically changed personalities in this film. This does not ruin the film, but it does leave a slight scar on it when watching it again, especially nearly back to back with the original. Like the first film I suggest watching this film again, but it doesn't have any real bearing on the Marvel Cinematic Universe as a whole so for those doing a necessities only marathon, this movie can be left alone.",guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol_2,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1

"Many People have the opinion that Marvel's The Incredible Hulk is
underrated. However, I disagree. This movie has no character development
or personality traits for any of its characters. Edward Norton as Bruce
Banner was just a normal guy in this movie; he has no personality or any
character growth throughout this movie. Liv Tyler as Betty Ross was
absolute garbage; her acting was bland and emotionless to the point that it
was jarring when she started shouting in one scene, albeit without reason.
Emil Blonsky/The Abomination is a bland villain with almost no motivations
and the generic trope of the villain having similar powers to the protagonist.
However, I will say that Thunderbolt Ross had some character and was very
well acted by William Hurt; I feel that he would have made a better main
antagonist than Abomination.

The story for this movie is boring and uninteresting, however it is still
serviceable for a mediocre film. The CGI used in this movie is bafflingly
bad, especially because Iron Man, a movie which was released before The
Incredible Hulk, has much better CGI; that said, I understand that the Hulk
is harder to animate than a metal suit. 

The score for the movie, composed by Craig Armstrong, is surprisingly
good and much better than the generic modern Hans Zimmer style of
movie soundtracks and I thoroughly enjoyed the music throughout the film.

"Jon Favreau and Robert Downey Jr. premiere an emotional start to an era of Marvel movies.

Jon Favreau ushered in a new era of superhero movies with his fantastic superhero sci-fi action adventure Iron Man (2008). He stylized Iron Man like it's a serious war drama with high stakes and character driven stories. Favreau took the often forgotten and maligned Marvel superhero Iron Man and made him into a household name and beloved pop culture figure.

Favreau approaches Tony Stark's character as a complex character with a transcendent character arc with a sympathetic perspective into a boozehound billionaire and scientific genius you believe would want to get into a metallic suit and shoot arc reactor beams at villains. Iron Man instantly became my favorite Marvel superhero after Favreau's first Iron Man movie as I'm sure he did for countless others. Iron Man was the blueprint, but Favreau perfected the model with his sterling archetype.

Favreau's heartfelt direction allows you to see Tony Stark as a flawed man, yet a deserving hero. Writers Art Marcum, Matt Holloway, Mark Fergus, and Hawk Ostby bring Tony Stark to life for the silver screen with his flippant sarcasm, constant insincerity, war profiteering, and depressive alcoholism despite his good nature and selfless heroism. 

In fact, Favreau demonstrates how Stark's choice to become Iron Man is anything but selfless as Tony wants to give back to a world he set on fire through his Stark family missiles. Favreau's direction for Iron Man is serious and enthralling. Jon Favreau's direction is so good that he redeems a war profiteering weapons salesman. I love Iron Man with a singular passion. I honestly think Iron Man is Marvel's best movie in their MCU as well as Jon Favreau's finest film as director with a real vision.

Robert Downey Jr.'s career is rescued as Jon Favreau casts this fallen star at his lowest point. I appreciate Favreau changing Robert Downey Jr.'s life around and giving him another chance as he is capable of greatness like Chaplin, Zodiac, Iron Man, and both Sherlock Holmes. Robert Downey Jr. is so charismatic, hilarious, charming, inspiring, and cool as Tony Stark and his superhero persona Iron Man that you will love the guy by the end of Favreau's film. 

Robert Downey Jr. and Iron Man are now household names because of this phenomenal film and brilliant performance from a master artist firing on all cylinders. You believe Tony Stark wants a paradigm shift in his love to earn his dead father's respect, while rekindling the love he has for Pepper Potts. Iron Man is certainly an emotional journey into self-discovery and personal recovery that launches Marvel's Cinematic Universe of superhero movies for decades to come.

Gwyneth Paltrow is so gorgeous as a redhead and really sweet as Tony Stark's love interest Virginia ""Pepper"" Potts. Paltrow's deadpan sarcasm is really funny and her tender flirting is subtle and sincere. You see her emotion in the tears in her eyes when Tony comes back from being held captive. She's very endearing and a key part of why Robert Downey Jr. is so likable as Tony Stark because of their romantic chemistry and compatible personalities. I honestly wish Marvel had focused more on Pepper Potts' relationship with Tony Stark in the later Iron Man and Avengers movies. Leslie Bibb is pretty and snarky as Vanity Fair reporter Christine Everhart.

Costume designers Laura Jean Shannon and Rebecca Gregg design slick pinstripe suits for Tony Stark, wicked Iron Man concepts, and sultry blouses, skirts, and dresses for Pepper Potts. Gwyneth Paltrow has never looked better than in Pepper Pott's navy blue backless dress at the Stark party dance scene. I love the layered, sleek chrome armor for Iron Man's suits, especially with all the intricate moving gears and wires underneath.

Jeff Bridges is fantastic as the often pleasant Obadiah Stane, then suddenly ominous and intimidating. His scene dancing around the truth in Tony's Stark office with Pepper is actually tense and frightening. He was an interesting villain with a for profit motive that makes sense as he doesn't care about casualties, only stock value. Once Bridges is playing Iron Monger, then the fight is quite intense. Terrence Howard was actually good here as Rhodey as he plays a solid foil to Stark's fooling around. His military presence is always a reminder that The United States Federal Government and the U.S. Army just wants Stark for his killing machines.

I enjoy Paul Bettany's pleasant voice as Tony Stark's robotic butler J.A.R.V.I.S. Jon Favreau's cameo as Harold ""Happy"" Hogan is the start of his wonderful and funny screen presence alongside Iron Man. Shaun Toub is phenomenal as Yinsen in the cave as his moral guidance and serious tone give Iron Man a gravitas and motivation like few heroes get as emotionally. 

Clark Gregg gets introduced as the likable S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Phil Coulson here. Peter Billingsley from A Christmas Story cameos as the scientist William Ginter Riva, who cannot figure out Tony Stark's arc reactor technology. Stan Lee's cameo got a laugh out of me alongside all his model dates. Samuel L. Jackson's first appearance as Nick Fury in Iron Man's after credits scene is a fun introduction to his stern style.

I'm glad Marvel's producers Stan Lee and Kevin Feige had the foresight to plan the MCU ahead and the decency to allow Jon Favreau to complete his unique directorial vision for Iron Man. Editor Dan Lebental cuts swiftly for a fast paced 126 minutes. Eventually, Iron Man became the formula for how Marvel cuts their movies together, but rarely do they feel as polished and sharp with their transitions and sequencing. 

Cinematographer Matthew Libatique came up with several iconic wide shots like Tony demoing his Jericho missile exploding in the background. I love Iron Man shooting a rocket at a tank and turning around as it shows you he's had enough of this situation. The close-up shots are really effective like the targeting bullets to not hit hostages that looks like a Western quick draw scene. Libatique's close-up shots are often emotional as Robert Downey Jr. captures Tony's sentiments with his tearful eyes, serious tone, and expressive facial acting.

Production designer J. Michael Riva's sets for Tony Stark's home and business are really cool. You always feel like Stark's mansion is the coolest place on Earth. J. Michael Riva's art direction, interior spaces, and real props for the suit and parts look amazing still. How did they get the practical effects so realistic and the CGI looking so real back in 2008 and yet modern Marvel movies have awful, fake, and ugly CGI? Visual effects artists Hal T Hickel, Andy Hass, and Ben Snow lead an impressive CGI team that merges the real and the fantasy with subtle uses of green screen mixed in with the prop work here.

Composer Ramin Djawadi creates a thrilling atmosphere and moving emotions with his magnificent score for Iron Man that combines softer classical pieces with fresh rock instrumentation. I adore Jon Favreau's choice of AC/DC, Suicidal Tendencies, and of course Black Sabbath songs throughout Iron Man. I wish Marvel experimented more with their soundtracks like Iron Man or Guardians of the Galaxy did. Sound designers Christopher Boyes and Frank E. Eulner makes every thruster and arc beam blast sound enormous.

In conclusion, I love Iron Man and Jon Favreau's first picture with Robert Downey Jr. will always remain my favorite Marvel movie.",iron_man,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,1,MonsterVerse,2,Wizarding World,4,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,DC Extended Universe,0

"This is such a Hulk movie, the brilliant scientific turned into a monster by an experiment he didn't even know it was to create a weapon, and then, general Russ going after him time and time again, and a final battle where we saw nothing but brute force, classic.

Sadly I never was sold on Ed Norton as Bruce Banner, amazing actor, but in my opinion not a good fit for the role. Also, the CGI in this movie was simply bad, even for the epoque. On top of that a very average writing, all of those things make of this movie an easy forgettable experience.

I still would love to see Marvel exploring more of Bruce Banner and The Hulk origins in a solo film, but since the rights are owned by Universal and this movie was a failure I don't think we'll be seeing anything like that any time soon. Maybe the new She-Hulk series gives us a little more of back-story...",the_incredible_hulk,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1
"Captain Marvel is a decent superhero action movie. Great costumes and special effects. Fight scenes and chase scenes are excellent. The story is formulaic, but there is a plot twist that makes it more interesting. I love how the Kree and the Skrulls were designed and represented. I just don't agree with one of the casting choices. Humor is alright, but some lines and situations were too cheesy. The cat named Goose stole the show by being both adorable and badass. Carol Danver's origin was well told and presented. It was great to see young Monica Rambeau. I hope we get to see more of her in the future. My expectation for this movie was rather high, and I was hoping for more depth and substance, but I was still entertained, nonetheless. It's still a good addition to the ever-growing superhero roster of the MCU.

"I'm a woman and I am all for ""Girl Power,"" if it's done right like in Wonder Woman (2017) or Supergirl (The Movie) not the TV show. But this movie? All the guys are jerks and the girls are all super duper awesome. And there is way too much music. The music is in almost every scene! It's like they knew it was bad, so they put awesome songs in almost every scene in hopes that it will make up for it. And they bash The Joker and other men like crazy! And Roman Sionis or whatever you want to call that monstrosity, was the worst person ever. It's like the writers said ""Let's make is a #metoo movie. And put the sickest, twisted, sexist, perv, slash killer that we can think of and make him the biggest idiot and paranoid person on the planet."" It's disgusting. The writers went out of there way to make this movie make men look like jerks. THIS MOVIE is sexiest towards all men. And the half star is for the only part I liked in this movie. And that's calling the hyena ""Bruce,"" after Bruce Wayne not knowing Bruce Wayne is also Batman. It's cute. I liked it. But the rest of this movie SUCKED!!! I have loved Harley Quinn since the animated series and this movie actually made me want to hate her.

"Black Panther sucks (I'm sorry, but it does). This movie, is a mess, from dumb plot conveniences to inconsistent characters, Black Panther is not a movie that I like to go back and rewatch. The actors are putting on brilliant performances, especially Michael B. Jordan as Killmonger and the late Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa, the sound effects are amazing and the CGI is good until the final battle, until it devolves into a bad PS2 boss fight. Other than that, this movie doesn't have much going for it. Having a similar plot to the Lion King, you'd think this movie would be good, but nope. Everything the Lion King succeeds at, Black Panther fails at miserably. For example, in the Lion King, Mufasa dies about half way through the movie then Scar takes the throne, giving the writers time to establish Scar as the villain and giving us time to understand how Scar will rule the Pride Lands before Simba comes back in the end and defeats him. However, in Black Panther, T'Challa and Killmonger only meet about 90 minutes into the movie, then T'Challa fake dies and comes back to life in the span of 15 minutes and then Killmonger dies 10 minutes later, giving us no time to  understand Killmonger's motivation and his way of ruling Wakanda. I could go on forever about all of Black Panther's problems, but I have a life, so I'll leave it with this: Black Panther was not a good movie and I'm not excited for the sequel.",black_panther_2018,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1
"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker wins the award for best opening scene in any Star Wars film. A movie with wonderful design, great choreography, nice(st) cinematography, stunning costuming, and an amazing score. So where could the film go from such a great opening? Does it go up from there? Or does it fail and falter throughout the rest of the film?

Me being an avid Star Wars fan, the return of the emperor was a great surprise. But it leaves so many questions. One being, why? What purpose did this serve to the new trilogy, could it have been avoided? Couldn't we have brought in a new villain? Once you get past the strange and horrific return of the notorious Emperor Palpatine, the film is really special. There are so many stand out aspects of this film that separate it from the others. Since I'm a sucker for cinematography and colors, I have to say that this is the best cinematography I've seen in any Star Wars film. 

This movie is pure nostalgia. It brings back old characters and memories that we love (or hate, possibly). The first time seeing Lando since the original trilogy is surprising and extremely exciting. I remember seeing this in theaters on release night and man did the audience go WILD! There are many times during TROS where tears will fill your eyes as you're overcome by the emotion and the sheer depth of what's in front of you. 

Something I find super intriguing about this one in specific is how it really dives into Kylo and Rey's ""force relationship"" and how they can see each other, touch each other, feel surroundings, etc. without actually being there. It explores the connection they have, and while it leaves a lot up to speculation, it's still really cool since we haven't seen anything like it in past films. 

And oh my gosh the lightsaber battle between Rey and Kylo when they're on the Death Star… the sound design, the animation, the choreography, the timing of everything, it's so well done. I am a sucker for the throne room fight but this is a close second. It's truly amazing to watch and to hear. Like how do you not see Kylo Ren and just gasp at how awesome he is, the way he holds his lightsaber upside down or the way he walks through a wave. He's a really cool villain and this movie did a terrific job actually showing him off in ways the 2 prior to TROS didn't.

The third act of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is what really made this film so enjoyable. It's non stop action filled with tears, laughter, awestruck staring, and so many different emotions. And how does one not tear up at ""but there's more of us Poe, there's more of us!"" ??? Tears, every single time. 

Well in my personal opinion, this movie did not fail as it went on. I do believe that the second act was a little bit boring, but that's almost impossible to avoid when your opening scene is as crazy as this one and the entire third act is entertaining as ever. The story falters a little bit, but why focus on the minor details? Just sit back and enjoy the scale of what's unfolding before your eyes. What's not to like?

I could pick apart every single moment of this film and say what I love and what I hate about it. Like honestly, this review could be longer than the movie script and I would still have more to say. I believe this is one of the most wrongly hated episodes of the Star Wars saga, as this one brings so much to the table. You just have to give it a chance and really try to enjoy it because honestly it's great!",star_wars_the_rise_of_skywalker,Star Wars,Star Wars,3,3,Star Wars,3,Star Wars,3,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Star Wars,3,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1

"Avengers: Endgame is an American superhero film. Based on Marvel Comics' The Avengers, produced by Marvel Studios. and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Picts. It is the twenty-second film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. and is the final and secondary film in the Phase 3 cinematic universe.
The film was directed by Anthony and Joe Russo and written by Christopher Marcus and Steven McFeeley.
The plot of the film is to bring people who have been snapped back to their former glory by searching for gems in the past, while the main character is led by Robert Downey Jr. as Tony S. Stark / Iron Man has a very prominent role and it's impressively well-acted. On the villain side, Josh Brolin plays Thanos, a very smart villain. Overall, I liked the storyline of this movie, the story of the journey while getting back the gems was fun and very addictive. As for the end of the story, it was very intense and impressive. And it's a bit sad, but this movie is a good start to the storyline of Phase 4. I was expecting Marvel to do well with the script, the CG settings, the sound, and it didn't disappoint really. All the actors did a great job. Until arriving here, the impression that everyone has been together for a long time until the end will become a beautiful new beginning, although very sad because of an unexpected ending and relationship. It shows the friendship that the characters have to each other that makes the audience feel the same way.

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002) treats fan to one more light hearted adventure before developing a darker tone to the franchise. In theory, the films plot is dark but the sense of fun around the movie makes it more of a enjoyable ride than a tense one. The Wizarding World is expanded upon with new magical items introduced as well as knowledge provided of magic outside of Hogwarts.

While Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (2001) was an intriguing adventure, the viewer knew what the mysterious object was due to the title, however with this film there is a constant interest into what lurks within the Chamber of Secrets.

This movie can drag in portions of the film but if you were to ever want a film to drag it would be one that exists within the Harry Potter universe as there is endless amounts of world building to explore, meaning you are constantly learning things about this world.

Many overlook Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002) as they believe it is one of the worst within the franchise, however it has a fascinating mystery, more world building and of course… a lot of fun.",harry_potter_and_the_chamber_of_secrets,Wizarding World,Wizarding World,4,4,Wizarding World,4,Wizarding World,4,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Wizarding World,4,Wizarding World,4

"The best movie ever made for Hulk honestly.

Director Louis Leterrier's superhero sci-fi thriller The Incredible Hulk (2008) presents Bruce Banner as a desperate man and brilliant scientist. I like how nuanced Edward Norton is as Bruce Banner as you really feel how conflicted he is over using his enormous powers as Hulk without control. Producers Stan Lee and Kevin Feige really let Leterrier go wild with stylish and intense direction that feels both grounded and gritty. The Incredible Hulk is certainly darker than other Marvel movies. 

The entire movie depicts Bruce as hurting, nervous, paranoid, angry, and sincere. Writer Zak Penn brings a humanity to his dialogue and thoughtful characterization of Bruce Banner and exciting action sequences for Hulk. Bruce feels like a real man figuring things out and having sensitive feelings. The Hulk kills it in the brutal hand to hand fight with Tim Roth's fearless super soldier Emil Blonsky. I appreciate Roth charging in and shooting erratically at Hulk, while the cool sonic wave guns blast at Hulk in the university grass. I don't like Abomination with his hideous design and ugly CGI, but the fight is brutal and engaging between him and Hulk. I just found Tim Roth more scary and interesting as a villain when he was a roided up human running and gunning at Hulk in broad daylight than in grimdark night as Abomination.

I love Bruce talking to his scientist girlfriend, played by the ethereal beauty Liv Tyler with her sincere and sympathetic love interest Betty Ross. Liv Tyler has real chemistry with Edward Norton and you can tell they both actually tried to act out a genuine romance drama for their earnest storyline together. Her kindness, patience, and understanding is the perfect foil to William Hurt's raving General Ross with his disdain for decency and willingness to cross any ethical line for The United States Army. 

Ang Lee's Hulk movie is awful and confusing, if stylish. Mark Ruffalo's a pleasant Bruce Banner without the depth or the fierceness of Hulk. So honestly, The Incredible Hulk gives us the fearsome monstrous Hulk with the heartfelt Bruce Banner of Edward Norton. Marvel could never figure out what to do with the big green guy afterwards besides as a support character. To this day, Mark Ruffalo has yet to receive his own solo Hulk movie. I guess Edward Norton's Bruce Banner will always be excellent on his own strengths.

Tim Blake Nelson's wily scientist is very fun and intriguing. I thought Ty Burrell added real heart to his shrink character in a rather humane moment. Lou Ferrigno's cameo is a cute nod to the original Hulk. Michael K. Williams has a quick cameo near the end and Stan Lee's cameo is actually hilarious as he guzzles down a gamma-ray radiated, green drink. Robert Downey Jr. has a charming and intriguing cameo to set up for Hulk joining The Avengers Initiative.

Editors Rick Shaine, John Wright, and Vincent Tabaillon cut really rapidly in a jarring opening montage that tries to address Hulk's origins, but I wish they would have just added a true opening sequence to establish Bruce Banner even though Ang Lee's Hulk was just a few years earlier. Most of the rest of the movie cuts at a normal pace for a brisk 114 minutes.

Cinematographer Peter Menzies Jr. has plenty of excellent close-up shots and medium shots that look lovely. There are too many shaky camera scenes and goofy fast zooms to really age well, but The Incredible Hulk generally looks great. It's got a raw grit and darkly lit realism to it. Kirk M. Petruccelli's production design has realistic poor communities and science buildings, but the final fight set is awful with dull bricks and random fires everywhere. Art directors Andrew M. Stearn, Page Buckner, and Dan Dorrance came up with a less neon green Hulk, opting for a grittier and darker moss green that works well with this movie's moody color palette. Set decorator Carolyn A. Loucks adorns labs with tons of machines and equipment that you never question the realism of alongside the Hulk.

Visual effects artists Betsy Paterson, Allan Magled, Kurt Williams, Julie D'Antoni, and Paul V. Molles did a solid job bringing a more grounded looking Hulk into Marvel's Cinematic Universe. The detail in their CGI is impressive and green colors look great. The Incredible Hulk's CGI still looks awesome, but Abomination looks dated and even uglier than when this was first released. Composer Craig Armstrong adds a haunting score and intense melodies to The Incredible Hulk that really works.

I like the pulsing and thudding of Hulk's smashing and jumping. The sound design on the sonic waves is really neat alongside the rippling green Hulk flesh CGI. Denise Cronenberg and Renee Bravener's costumes look natural for our modern era and consider how to keep Bruce Banner's clothes on Hulk. Randy Westgate and Beate Petruccelli's make-up gives Edward Norton an intense look, Tim Roth a sweaty ferociousness, and Liv Tyler a lovely glow.

In short, The Incredible Hulk is a great Marvel movie and strangely underrated now. You'd think Hulk fans would have appreciated Marvel actually giving Bruce Banner's character some respect with an interesting solo movie for once.",the_incredible_hulk,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,DC Extended Universe,0,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1

"Superman is the symbol of hope, goodness, always doing the right thing, good values, etc.  So I was disappointed to see this more grounded version where he doesn't have these trade mark values.  First he lets his father die when he could have saved him.  The original version where he dies of a heart attack and no matter what Clark does even with his powers, he can't save him is a message in itself, but in this version, he lets his father die...like what kind of person would do that?  He could easily saved his father and no one would know and even if they did, how would they trace back to them. This Clark Kent is callous and cold.  Superman has never killed anyone, yet in this one, he fights Zod in Metropolis without luring him away and flattens buildings and does massive damage to the city...probably with people still inside hiding since most of the people did not evacuate the city. In fact, he's a murderer since at the end he snaps Zod's neck to save some humans despite the fact he could have used super speed to move them out of the way, jump in front of them to take the ocular blast, punch Zod away or since he's holding him fly away with Zod, like there is a ton of ways to take him out without killing him.

"This is my all time favorite Star Wars movie! I really don't have any criticisms of this film, anything people attacked in Episodes 1 and 2 are non existent here. First, the CGI, visual effects and cinematography are ahead of their time; some films made in the last five years don't look this good! Second, anyone who said Hayden Christensen was a bad actor won't have anything to say here because he really brings it in this movie, especially during Anakin's betrayal on Mustafar and when he says ""I HATE YOU"" to Obi-wan. In fact, all the lead acting is incredible from Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Ian McDiarmid and Samuel L. Jackson. Aside from Duel of The Fates, the lightsaber duels in this are my favorite of the entire franchise, they're so well choreographed. Anakin's turn to the dark side is done really well, this movie builds on what we saw in Attack of The Clones when Anakin slaughters the sand people. I could feel the conflict in him and could see over the course of the movie as he fell further and further to the temptation of the dark side. Anakin's journey from being a slave boy to the most iconic villains in film was great to watch and I thought this movie concluded the prequel trilogy so well. The emotional weight and devastation you feel during the Order 66 sequence and Anakin's betrayal are conveyed beautifully through the cinematography, music and acting. On to my final point: the music is unbelievable, John Williams really brought his A game and it really helped to elevate the tension, excitement, and other emotions during many scenes.

"This was the first MCU film I saw that I wouldn't have considered a fluke. Avengers definitely seemed a little too big to fail, but Guardians of the Galaxy?

"This movie is so ""woke"" it forgot to do anything else but spew culture politics, like you know; build any sense of a character instead of telling us what they are, have a consistent storyline with the rest of the MCU (looking at you Cthulhu cat), and just so many more things. The only good as with most Marvel film is the SFX/CGI.

"This is in no way a knock on the first Thor because I enjoyed it a lot, but, as said with Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Thor: The Dark World impressed me more. The look of the film is wonderful, Asgard is just as colourful as it was in Thor yet also darker too, matching the darker, bolder tone very well. The photography and editing are stylish and the locations, especially Iceland, are stunningly vivid. The special effects are even more dazzling than in Thor and the same can be said for the stunts. The music score by Brian Taylor is dynamic and never repetitive or pedestrian, adding to the action sequences rather than detracting. Speaking of the action sequences, they are packed with thrills with battles almost on scale of Lord of the Rings and smack-downs that are enough to crush the bones. But Thor: The Dark World is not just about action and spectacle, it has substance too(or at least it did to me), laden with humour that will genuinely make you laugh but doing so without over-powering the dark nature of the story or the tense sparring between Thor and Loki. The story is compelling with the right doses of action, humour and drama, it's bigger in scale and bolder in tone than the first Thor but also more expansive in characterisation. The acting is top-class with most of the cast getting more to do, Anthony Hopkins is always dependable and Natalie Portman brings a touch of class and Stellan Skarsgard has some very funny moments but the acting honours do go to Chris Hemsworth, who's more robust and poised than he was in the first Thor, and especially Tom Hiddleston, who is terrific as Loki and pitches his mellifluousness and serpentine-like malevolence perfectly. My only complaints here are Christopher Eccleston having very little to do so he gives a somewhat one-dimensional performance that exudes moody menace but not much else and Loki surrendering and Thor forgiving him too easily and quickly. All in all however, a truly excellent follow-up that improves even more over the first Thor. 9/10 Bethany Cox",thor_the_dark_world,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1

"Rogue One is interesting for me. It's quite the unbalanced movie, where most of the characters are rather uninteresting until the final third of the movie. In fact, much of the movie just passes over okay for the first two thirds. Certainly not bad, but nothing special either aside from some cool bits of worldbuilding (the death troopers and U-Wing are pretty awesome). But this is all made up for with the climax, which is easily one of the best finales in Star Wars history. It's like going from a 5 to a 10 in full whiplash. The battle of Scarif is  so epic with its action-packed skirmishes and it really puts the ""War"" in Star Wars. The tension builds as the characters are picked off one by one and the rebel alliance rushes in with all their cavalry as they finally step out of the shadows to defy the empire. And that final hallway scene with Darth Vader was epically haunting. He's more like a force of nature that you can't kill, but only escape from. But as epic as the conclusion is, the meandering first two thirds of the movie kind of drag it down for me. I'd be more forgiving if they made the lead character Jyn more interesting. They should've made her feel like a real rogue, like Cara Dune or a female Han Solo. Instead she spends most of the time with her head down, saying he lines quietly and often being overshadowed by her male co-stars. The worst example being when Cassian explodes at her for daring to be angry that her father died indirectly because of his actions. His defense that he's ""been in this fight since I was six years old"" is such a laughably contrived Freudian excuse that comes out of nowhere and has little to do with the argument. Especially when considering how Jyn's been in this fight since she was nine years old, except she was abandoned and left to fend for herself on the streets. And this is  never brought up! A character with such a harsh upbringing should feel more assertive rough around the edges, but instead she comes across like a frail mopey teenager that always looks constipated. The writing and direction surrounding her character felt low-key sexist to me. But I guess being a cynical rogue with a heart of gold is only cool when men do it. Many of the other characters are either bland or too over-the-top. The cameos are sometimes exciting, and other times feel so contrived and random. The only character I really stuck out to me was K2-S0, the snarky security droid. He easily had the best dialogue and was cracking me up.  So overall, I'd say this movie was quite the mixed bag for me. But the lows aren't too low and the highs are high enough to bump my score up to a 7/10, even if the highs are mostly just blatant fanservice. But I'm a Star wars fan at heart, so it touched the inner child in me that just wanted to watch starships and space wizards.",rogue_one_a_star_wars_story,Star Wars,Marvel Cinematic Universe,3,1,DC Extended Universe,0,DC Extended Universe,0,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,MonsterVerse,2
"You know the old saying, ""They don't make 'em like they use to""?

Well, I finally understand that line more than I ever did before.  This movie is a reminder of a time when films and adaptations were made with passion and creativity.  And let me tell ya, this movie holds up even to this day.  The directing, the writing (eh, kinda, the dialogue was off at times), the acting, the sets, the special and physical effects, and even right down to the music are all amazing to witness on the big screen.  And it feels great to see the main trio as kids again.

I sadly became a Harry Potter fan very late into the game and never got to see the first five films in theaters, heavily due to religious family members.  But when my mother gave me permission to read the books and watch the movies, it was one of (if not ) the greatest experience(s) of my life.  And it seems I'm able to make up for it now.

The character Rey palpatine has terrible character development because she never lifted a lightsaber in her life and somehow beat kylo ren! KYLO REN!!! Not to mention she somehow used force heal with no training which takes Jedis a long time to master and in the next movie she some how used FORCE LIGHTING!?

I'm just praying right now that these sequels are just fan fictions because I can't deal with these terrible movies, all the sequels are a 0/10 because they are all TERRIBLE!!! Not to mention how did ben solo even die! HE LOOKED FULLY ALIVE 5 SECONDS AGO THEN LITERALLY HAD A HEART ATTACK OR SOMETHING. Im positive that ben solo died of some other unknown disease that instantly kills you than dying to palpatine. That is all I just hope next movie it will be about pre prequels instead of this sad excuse for a movie. For now I will be hoping that Rey palpatine dies by ewoks and eaten alive or jar jar binks finds her (keep in mind that jar jar binks is around 80 to 90 when the sequels are taking place) and becomes the Jedi he was destined to be and finished Rey palpatine, then he creates the new Jedi temple and then created the jedi order",star_wars_the_last_jedi,Star Wars,Star Wars,3,3,Star Wars,3,Star Wars,3,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Star Wars,3,Star Wars,3
"The Suicide Squad not only succeeds as a superhero movie, but a film overall. It's very funny, and the performances are great. John Cena as Peacemaker, really stands out, Idris Elba as Bloodsport is also really good. All the characters are enjoyable, even fucking Polka Dot Man was done well. The most surprising villain that they got right was Nanaue; they somehow managed to make King Shark, a massive killing machine, cute. You know that all of our protagonists are extremely dangerous, but each of them has their own charm that makes them bearable. The story is good, but not great. It's completely absurd, so you need some suspension of disbelief for the plot to work. The best idea in the whole film is the opening scene, they do something very clever, which prepares the viewer for what's to come. It was the perfect way to start the film. All in all, The Suicide Squad is a great step forward for DC.

"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is awesome. The story is the best from every sector. considered perfect The start of the battle, adventure, action that has come into play due to the fact that in this sector Hogwarts has organized a Triwizard tournament. Tourmemt and other magic schools are also participating. Each school will send a representative to compete in this magic tournament. The age of the participants must be at least 17 years old, although Harry is not yet. Reached the criteria, but he accidentally entered the competition. This creates a lot of turmoil because the life expectancy line that Dumbledore, Head Professor of Horgwarts, has a dash. There's no way a child under 17 can deceive, causing the whole school to think that Harry lied that he wasn't doing it, and Harry's best friend Ron became jealous because he thought Harry wanted to be a hero. That's a really crazy idea for me. It frustrates me a lot with Ron's stupidity, but it's understandable because it's Ron Lol, and it leaves Harry out of nowhere. I'm so sad.  Ron is seriously bipolar in this regard.
	I liked this part because I saw the development of the relationship of the 3 friends, the different stages they had to prepare. It gave me a lot of excitement, such as the amazing battle between Harry and the dragon. He fights with excitement. And the scene where you have to open the underwater crystal ball in order to hear the hint to understand because it's a hint from the mermaids that make it on land to not understand. It was a scene that was truly unthinkable. seeing many wonderful things The creatures in the magical world that I had imagined while reading. The effect is done very well. Many characters appear in this installment a lot or even Harry has used what he learned to compete. It's amazing how he remembered what he had learned, Lol.
	The movie puts more pressure on the viewers with the final mission that viewers like me watch and become uncomfortable instead. because everyone was led into the maze There aren't any demons here, but what we do find is the fear in our minds of going in the unknown and unfamiliar places. Suffocation and the scene clashing with the resurrected Lord Voldemort. He was really scary but he killed my Cedric which was way too easy. The effects of this movie never really disappoint. Every scene is great, amazing blend of magic, horror, humor and comedy and it's extremely entertaining and darker than the previous films.
	It's not a perfect movie. A lot of things were rushed and skipping the good ones made me still prefer the book. but for the time 157 minutes watched I'm not disappointed at all It's a very good time.

"No, I'm sorry, I can't with this movie. I'm going to go out on a limb and say it's the worst in the MCU. It misses everything they built up in Thor. The character is still good, but the story there is no saving it. A villain with no personality, no reason to be, bland. I also think it's a big mistake that they gave so much attention to Darcy and the other supporting characters. Yes, sometimes they can be a good comic relief, but here they overdo it. Loki dying again but not really, it already feels too forced. I think many will agree with me that they don't even remember half the movie.

While the plot itself is simple, the characters and actions scenes within this movie hold it together and make it a fun movie to watch, even with its dialogue heavy middle. This is a must watch again with Avengers Endgame coming up, as it is the first time these characters were brought together on the big screen.

Diana was nerfed from being a smart, strong woman to a heartbroken, teenage-like girl. The chains of events are only happening because its convenient for the characters. The villain was only interesting at first before becoming a joke on the third act. Cheetah was underused.

"Burdened with a glorious purpose…

And it's the finale of the quest of Harry Potter and his friends. Wow this one was awesome. The danger could not be any more prominent, and characters said his name because who cares, he's going to kill them anyway. 

The dead counts speed through the roof with this one. However, with certain deaths revealed the true glorious purposes that those characters were burdened with. I saw some of them in different light, and it was very sad.

The beginning started just a little bit slow, but after that, the movie became unrelentingly thrilling. Even though it's the shortest in runtime in the franchise, I was basically glued to the TV the entire time. I sensed so much urgency in Harry and could not be more invested in him and his allies. 

The ending did not disappoint and delivered plenty explosion, wizardry, and valor from the characters. Everyone united and faced the strong and desperate dark lord himself. It was glorious.

"Not sure why the audience reviews are so bad- most seem to have some other agenda rather than actually thinking the film was bad. 
As for me, I began this movie with low expectations, prepared for a very woke/feminist trashy plot with all the focus being on 'oh my god its a girl wow' and not much relevance to the MCU, I did NOT expect to be invested in the film at all. 
What I got was a plot that was actually almost an origin story for the MCU, with a healthy amount of girl power that was pleasant and not rubbed in the face, and quite a decent storyline with some cool action scenes and good humour. It's not the best film I've seen- the plot was a bit predictable in places and the after a certain point the villains didn't seem dangerous enough for the plot to feel threatened by them- but nonetheless I enjoyed seeing a less serious (and two-eyed!) version of Nick Fury and overall this film far exceeded my expectations; I enjoyed it more than I thought it would and certainly far more than reviewers who let some outside source affect their experience.

"This movie is a really good movie for me, but it might have been a little confusing on the intro for those who didn't watch the previous episode, it would have been nice to have a little bit of a reversal. But that doesn't make the movie any less fun.
    In this movie, we will meet the most exciting and epic battle in the Marvel Universe that we may not have seen in any other movie because of the fight against the eternal villains, Thanos, who has already possessed Infinity Gallet with all colors of gems, made him very powerful and made the all of the Avengers join in the fight. After all, it feels bent that the main character like Iron Man has to give up his life, and it's a scene that brings tears to my eyes.
   Avenger: Endgame, even though it's the end, I think it's the most perfect ending. Since protecting others requires sacrificing something or even someone's life to keep all the people on this planet alive, that's what we appreciate call them 'hero'.
   From the previous episode I watched, Avenger: Civil War, I felt that episode was really dreary and compared to this episode, making it clear that Marvel has evolved even more, whether it's a story walk that makes more sense, the effects are made me goosebump and think that it would cost more than a billion dollars. It likes Endgame is the best episode for all Avenger movies I've seen.
   Compared to movies and cartoons, I still feel that the movie itself is still not as detailed as it is in comic books, probably because with a few hours to screen and many books that can be released, it has to be partially dissolved.
   In the end, I'd like to conclude that it's a movie that's worth watching for once, but if you don't like such fantasy action movies, I wouldn't recommend it to you since it makes you feel dizzy and not fun at all, but for the fantasy action movie disciples, I recommend it to you all

"Imperio… Crucio… Avada Kadavra… now time to go to Azkaban.

So there's more than one wizard school. The plot is about the Triwizard tournament, where each school's representative battled for the glory. But somehow Potter was chosen as the fourth contestant, and we have ourselves a fun and intense story.

I was surprised and happy that I wasn't bored through another two and a half hours of this franchise. This is the first one that kept my interest throughout. Again, there were more unique wizard stuff that further expanded the universe. This was always fun to watch, and this movie still kept that tradition going.

The first half actually was teen drama where the students went to a ball. The romance was more prominent, and even became naughty in some scenes.  What drove the plot was the tournament, and the looming danger that hid beneath it throughout the runtime.

When the imminent doom hit at around the last round of the tournament, the movie became vastly more intense. For the first time, I felt that Harry's life was in actual danger. 

As for problems, the runtime was still a tad bit long. Also, some of the rounds in the tournament were pretty weak an could have been more fun.

"I understand they want to create and elevate more strong female characters, but with Captain Marvel it's seem like that is the ONLY thing they focused on. This movie is riddled with glaring, plot holes and mediocre, lazy writing that often ignores, negates, and/or renders nonsensical, several elements previously established in the MCU. The development of the main character seemed rushed and is so shallow, one dimensional and forced, that it almost seems as if the message they were trying to convey was more important to them than the story itself or creating a complex, well rounded character, that is intended (I assume) to be a cornerstone  in the next phase of the MCU.",captain_marvel,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,1,DC Extended Universe,0,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Star Wars,3,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1
"With only the vaguest whiff of a story and a lack of character development even in Bruce Banner, the sort of tortured conflicted comic book character seemingly custom-made for character development, The Incredible Hulk really only has its special effects going for it. And while those are decent, a movie that is nothing but its special effects is not a movie. Ed Norton doesn't really do much with the role. Yes, I know Ed Norton is a brilliant actor prone to giving amazing performances, but he just doesn't do that here; Mark Ruffalo's iconic Bruce Banner in the Avengers is far more interesting than Norton's here.",the_incredible_hulk,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,1,MonsterVerse,2,DC Extended Universe,0,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1
"Godzilla 2014 is a fresh and recommended product to see. There may be some mistakes as a lot of films, but it is very enjoyable for its realistic effects (despite to be very dark) and his interesting characters, except for the protagonist. Its soundtrack may not be too attractive as the 2004 film, but you can see the effort and care put into this film to try to be very original and not fall into nostalgia with cliches. The main and true protagonist does not come out much and that the ""villains"" can is kinda disappointing; but it gives it some tension so that Godzilla seems like an overwhelming and powerful being that should not be messed with.",godzilla_2014,MonsterVerse,MonsterVerse,2,2,MonsterVerse,2,MonsterVerse,2,MonsterVerse,2,MonsterVerse,2,MonsterVerse,2

The movie was ultimately a cliché rolled directly out of a rushed cinematic universe. The magic and creativity of Marvel was gimped into a not-so-funny lackluster movie that eventually led to this. Though the historical impact this movie had in team-up superhero movies is ultimately the longest lasting legacy I am happy this movie paved the way for.,marvels_the_avengers,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,DC Extended Universe,0,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1
"Really? I mean, just really? Anybody who worked on anything having to do with this movie needs to be put on the Hollywood blacklist. This movie was on par with the likes of Halle Berry's Catwoman or Ben Affleck's Daredevil (except with 100x the budget). It should be shown in Film School so that prospecting young filmmakers can see that they cannot buy their way out of making something awful.

(Side note) I understand that Gal Gadot is an incredibly beautiful actress. She is also incredibly talented. Everybody understands this. Will they please stop having scenes where she is up in the air in a super model pose with the thousand yard stare and her hair flailing against the wind? These scenes are far too artificial. She stops being Wonder Woman and turns into an actress playing Wonder Woman and it stands out. Next time, they should focus on a decent plot and her ability will work itself out. We do not need it to be force fed (or in the case of this movie: waterboarded).",wonder_woman_1984,DC Extended Universe,DC Extended Universe,0,0,DC Extended Universe,0,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,DC Extended Universe,0,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1
"Superhero films are always fun to watch when they are done right, and while to some degree it is understandable why people wouldn't be totally enamoured with it(as seen in a lot of the negative comments, a lot of them being condescending though- enough with the ignorant conspiracy theories already!- and some not even worthy of being called reviews) Avengers Assemble for me was an example of a fun and intelligent superhero film that was done right. True, the story is formulaic but not to the extent that was too distracting. In fact my only two complaint was to do with one performances that didn't quite work personally. And that was Jeremy Renner who was rather on the dull side as Hawkeye, whose character development did seem a little rushed and underwritten, that Hawkeye has inner demons is made very clear but it could have come through more strongly. However the rest of the performances were great, a big shout out going to Tom Hiddleston who is serpentine personified as Loki, though Robert Downey Jnr's charismatic Iron Man, Samuel L. Jackson's no-nonsense Nick Fury, Mark Ruffalo's very confident Hulk(he doesn't make you miss Eric Bana or Ed Norton), Chris Hemsworth's dynamic and not wimpy Thor(if he was I put it down to his hidden demons character development) and Chris Evans' modest, heartfelt Captain America were equally great. Scarlett Johansson convinces mostly too, Black Widow's back story is intriguing and Johansson is wonderful when she acts fearless but when in her emotional, imploring moments her acting is rather forced and out of character for Black Widow. For a film with as many characters as seen here, Avengers Assemble still makes a vast majority of them very interesting(only Hawkeye really disappointed), in character and not one-sided and all of them have their turn to shine. It didn't feel to me like a film that tried to cram in too many heroes all at once for the sake of it. The film is very slickly made with astounding special effects and dazzlingly executed stunt-work. Alan Silvestri's score pulsates with power and the action sequences are exciting. The story may be formulaic and standard good-and-evil but is crisply paced and intelligently handled with just the right blend of humour, pathos and action with not one component over-shadowing the others. What was really enjoyable especially was the toe-to-toe with Thor and Iron Man and Hulk. What was really remarkable was the script, filled with thoughtful exposition and snappy banter that stayed true to The Avengers while also with Joss Whedon's own style that was apparent in a lot of his other work. Overall, Avengers Assemble may not be 100% perfect or among the best ever but it is still an outstanding film with a lot to love about it, and no this is not coming from a fake account or a plant, just someone who can be hard to please who genuinely enjoyed it. 9/10 Bethany Cox",marvels_the_avengers,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,1,DC Extended Universe,0,DC Extended Universe,0,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,DC Extended Universe,0

"A funny and intriguing Marvel movie with the mighty Thor!

Director Alan Taylor's superhero romantic fantasy thriller Thor: The Dark World (2013) is often maligned as Marvel's worst movie, but I found it enjoyable when I first saw it as well as after revisiting it now. 

Alan Taylor's direction is gripping, balancing strange fantasy elements like dark elves, silly comedy with Kat Dennings' blunt intern Darcy, and sweet romance drama between Chris Hemsworth's Thor and Natalie Portman's Jane Foster. Producers Stan Lee and Kevin Feige entrusted Thor to Alan Taylor, who takes Chris Hemsworth's Norse god Thor into a tender romantic hero and quirky fun loving guy. 

Chris Hemsworth's Thor is not the celestial deity from Thor or The Avengers, but Hemsworth's Thor is still endearing and cool. Hemsworth's naturally funny charisma, buff physique, likable easy going personality, intense screen presence, and striking romantic charm all work in his favor as The God of Thunder Thor.

Writers Christopher Markus, Stephen McFeely, Robert Rodat, Don Payne, and Christopher L. Yost curiously dive into mythology to make Thor's new villains dark elves. The dark elves are neat folklore figures with dark imagery and atmosphere. However, Christopher Eccleston's creepy and commanding Malekith is not the most interesting Marvel antagonist either. 

I found the voluptuous Kat Dennings' Darcy a chipper source of comedy relief. Everything Dennings says as Darcy is hilarious to me. She's so dumb funny. Thor and Jane's tender romance feels authentic and heartwarming again with their cute rapport emotionally working on me again like in Kenneth Branagh's Thor. The fierce rivalry and brotherly bond between Thor and Loki is explored to a genuinely moving finale where loyalties and motivations are tested. There are actual character arcs in Thor: The Dark World.

Natalie Portman is lovely and intelligent as scientist Jane Foster once again. I think her romantic chemistry with Chris Hemsworth really adds a lot of warmth and heart to Thor's Marvel movies. Tom Hiddleston's trickster god Loki is always funny, sly, and emotionally resonant. Anthony Hopkins has that peerless gravitas as Odin Allfather with Hopkins giving hard glares and stalwart emotional clarity in every one of his lines.

Jaimie Alexander is so pretty and cool as Lady Sif. I wish Marvel had given her more action sequences and deeper characterization as Jaimie Alexander is an amazing actress. Zachary Levi, Ray Stevenson, and Tadanobu Asano are still exciting and funny as Thor's brothers in arms. Idris Elba's steadfast and solemn Heimdall and Rene Russo's moving mother of Thor named Frigga are fantastic like in Thor. Stellan Skarsgård is very funny and likable as Erik Selvig once again. Alice Krige is sincerely eerie as Eir. Chris O'Dowd gets cucked by Chris Hemsworth's masculinity in his love for Natalie Portman's Jane Foster. Stan Lee's cameo is as charming as his other appearances in Marvel's movies. Chris Evans and Benicio del Toro's cameos are really neat and fun.

Editors Dan Lebental and Wyatt Smith's steady cuts keep Thor: The Dark World moving right along for an easy going fantasy adventure that does not drag too much in 112 minutes. Cinematographer Kramer Morgenthau uses these lovely ultra wide shots for the fantasy dark elves sequences, but as usual for me, I prefer the sleek and intimate close-up shots of Thor, Jane, Darcy, or Loki that are more emotionally revealing. John Bush's set decoration feels natural for Selvig's lab equipment, and grand for Asgard's golden realm of the gods.

Art directors Julian Ashby, Mike Stallion, Ray Chan, Thomas Brown, Jordan Crockett, Mark Swain, Matthew Robinson, Hayley Easton Street, and Adriaan Engelbrecht craft a grim fantasy realm for the dark elves. I wish we got to see more of their bleak world as visual effects artists James Baker, Mike Stillwell, and Adrien Flanquart's CGI is impressive for the black shroud of magic infesting Natalie Portman's Jane Foster.

Composer Brian Tyler wrote a beautiful, melodic score for Thor: The Dark World. His symphony captures the brooding nightshade of the dark elves, gentle romantic feelings for Thor and Jane, as well as a touching melody of Loki's fateful choice. 

Costume designers Wendy Partridge, Ken Crouch, Alejandro M. Hernandez, Gia Jimenez, Jacqueline Shulman, Nigel Hyams, Kim Shek, Kurt J. Blackwell, and Jason Airey come up with neat outfits for everyone. I do wish there was more color to these costumes and more saturation in general in The MCU. The make-up crew did amazing work for the dark elves and main cast making everyone look amazing.

In short, Thor: The Dark World is slightly underrated and very entertaining. It's solidly in the middle of Marvel's movies for me, not near the bottom.",thor_the_dark_world,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,1,MonsterVerse,2,DC Extended Universe,0,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,DC Extended Universe,0
"This movie wasn't funny, wasn't energetic, wasn't adrenaline pumping and was barely even impressive or creative from a technical perspective.  I didn't hate it by any means, but I found the first Ant Man to be a semi-inconsequential entry to the MCU, and this sequel is the exact same thing, only doubly-so.  Again, there's a lot more bickering between the two main heroes than there needs to be, the Wasp being a character that is often times just abrasive and needlessly mean-spirited, and there are random shifts from action to comedy that are extremely jarring as neither the action nor comedy work.  And while the first movie did have some genuine heart involving our main hero's broken family, all of that is removed in favor for just ""more comedy"" (a shame as the comedy is so bad).  The climax, at least, does have some engaging moments, but this feels too-little/too-late, as the movie felt like it did nothing but meander the entire runtime leading up to it.  None of the characters are engaging, only our main hero is charismatic, and the villains are entirely unmemorable.  I did really like the Infinity War tie-in at the very, very end, however.",ant_man_and_the_wasp,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1
"A delightfully funny and touching reflective piece for the third installment of Iron Man.

Director Shane Black's superhero action-comedy adventure Iron Man 3 (2013) is a high buzz of deliriously funny jokes and intriguing character drama that gets to the heart of Tony Stark's heroism. The entire point is about Tony Stark facing the consequences of his actions from cruelly blowing off a scientist, sleeping and ditching a ""botanist"" lady, to just simply getting Pepper Potts a terrible Christmas present. Shane Black's direction is a blast of chaotic action sequences that are well thought out in choreography and logic with Stark beating bad guys with wit as much as Iron Man's repulsor rays. Producers Stan Lee and Kevin Feige were smart to entrust Shane Black with Tony Stark's complex character and wicked humor for his stellar Iron Man 3.

Shane Black and Drew Pearce's writing is not only clever with their irreverent sense of humor, but also genuinely heartfelt as you see that indeed Iron Man's heroism comes from Tony Stark's bravery and perseverance. Stark grows as a man and learns new and innovative ways to be heroic. His genius intellect must be used to save lives and be kinder than he used to be during his days as a sleazy billionaire playboy. I found Black and Pearce's writing exceptionally profound as Tony Stark must solve his problems without the effortless use of his Iron Man suit as the real hero is the man himself.

Robert Downey Jr. is hilarious again as Tony Stark as he feels cool and in control no matter how dire things get. Robert Downey Jr. plays up Stark's trauma and anxiety over nearly dying to aliens and a nuclear bomb in New York back in The Avengers. It feels thoughtful and funny as those scenes are due to Robert Downey Jr.'s insane charisma and natural hilarity. Robert Downey Jr. shows Tony Stark's failings and mistakes as well as his willingness to fix problems and deep character flaws at Stark's convenience of course. He just is Tony Stark really.

Robert Downey Jr. gets the sincere, cute, and sarcastic romance drama exactly right alongside the lovely Gwyneth Paltrow as the fierce and caring Pepper Potts. All of Gwyneth Paltrow's expensive pantsuits and cute dresses look fabulous on her too from fashionable costume designer Louise Frogley. She's particularly breathtaking in Iron Man 3. Tony Stark and Pepper Potts will always have my favorite romance story of all the MCU movies. Gwyneth Paltrow is so playful in a snarky way, while also feeling distinctly mature for Marvel's movies. She handles Robert Downey Jr.'s ridiculous attitude and flippant remarks with a cool ease and deft grace. Gwyneth Paltrow makes Pepper Potts as endearing as Tony Stark honestly and even gets a killer finale sequence in Iron Man 3.

Don Cheadle is quite funny and steadfast as Iron Man's sidekick Rhodey. He went from fun and reliable as War Machine to a true blue government stooge as Iron Patriot, even though I like the name. Guy Pearce's Aldrich Killian is a fantastic villain with understandable motivation. His fearsome fire breathing and red hot melting point powers are wild to behold. Rebecca Hall is so interesting and serious as Maya Hansen. She's a brilliant foil for Tony Stark and has a sweet scene with Pepper Potts too. 

Jon Favreau's Happy has never been funnier or more ridiculous with his pompous attitude as Head of Stark Security. Sir Ben Kingsley is phenomenal as The Mandarin because he is genuinely frightening with his deep voice and harsh lessons for America, while getting seriously hilarious scenes in the last act. Stephanie Szostak is gorgeous as Brandt and really intimidating with her firebrand ferocity. James Badge Dale is cool with his calm presence as the fiery villain Coldblood.

William Sadler has a fun cameo as The President of The United States of America. Dale Dickey is touching in her mournful cameo. Ty Simpkins is cute as the eager engineer boy Harley, who helps Tony Stark in his hour of need. Paul Bettany's voice is excellently sarcastic as J.A.R.V.I.S. in Iron Man 3. Bill Maher, Joan Rivers, George Kotsiopoulos, and Stan Lee of course all have quick funny cameos. You can see a young child actress Jenna Ortega as the Vice President's daughter. Corey Hawkins even has an early career cameo as a radar monitor before Straight Outta Compton. Mark Ruffalo's cameo startled me with laughter. Apparently, Fan Bingbing has a fast cameo in Iron Man 3 somewhere.

Editors Jeffrey Ford and Peter S. Elliot cut so quickly during the exciting action, while allowing the drama scenes to gently garner emotions. Iron Man 3 does not even feel half its 130 minute length. Cinematographer John Toll captures magnificent wide shots of Tony Stark's mansion falling into the sea to intimate close-ups of Robert Downey Jr. mourning Pepper Potts or contemplating his regrets and anxieties. Iron Man 3 looks excellently shot just like Jon Favreau's Iron Man and Iron Man 2.

Production designer Bill Brzeski keeps Stark's seaside manor looking like a cool set with neat small town sets that look believable. Danielle Berman's set decorations add all sorts of technological props to Tony's labs. Art directors Alan Hook, Jason Bistarkey, Brian Stultz, Desma Murphy, and Jay Pelissier lean into terrorist imagery and fearmongering with crazy dark footage for Marvel alongside Stark's hopeful Iron Man suits getting rebuilt. The CGI feels advanced far beyond even The Avengers or early Marvel movies.

Composer Brian Tyler opts for a darker and moodier score than the first two Iron Man films. His music effectively takes you into Tony Stark's mindset and conflicted feelings the entire movie. Sound designer Mark P. Stoeckinger adds these burning flame sounds and massive explosions alongside cool pulse noises for Iron Man's repulsor rays.

In conclusion, Iron Man 3 is a real blessing from Shane Black as his movie alongside John Favreau's Iron Man and Iron Man 2 are all fantastically endearing and entertaining movies.",iron_man_3,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Wizarding World,1,4,DC Extended Universe,0,DC Extended Universe,0,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1

"Black Panther is such a remarkable movie that mere words cannot properly express how good it is, but we try.

Michael B. Jordan as Killmonger was exceptional, I hated the depiction of the character since the writers made him despicable, but I hate it in the good way, like this guy is so evil that I cannot help but feel outrage everytime he pops on the screen. I think one of the reasons he was so great is because he got enough screen time, writers really made him an important part of the movie and not just an empty accesory to justify a final battle.

The movie portraits different aspects of african culture, which makes it really enjoyable.

The writing was brilliant, with no filling material and really interesting side-stories.

And lastly, the sounds effects/music/soundtrack was just brilliant! It came as no surprise to me the fact that this movie won Best Original Score during the Academy Awards 2019.

"Sure it's DC.  Ima gonna watch it because I'm supposed to be addicted to superhero movies and tropes, but in the end ... this was free to watch.  Even though I'm all over the water based spacial and battle effects, this ended up being the take away, as well as Arthurs (Mamoa) own origin story ... check ... thats done.

The problem is, the writers just didnt give Mamoa any latitude to give his character any real depth.  Hes 2 dimensional; uncommitted wanna be fish king and screwed up linage - son of a lighthouse keeper who just wouldnt move on from where to be at dawn ... and thats it, resulting in him becoming fish king.

Where other super hero arcs; Thor, Hulk, and Wonder Woman managed to get writers capable of actually giving us a 3 dimensional arc of tragedy and pain, resulting in a real reason to be who they are ... here we dont really know why Arthur really needed to save the world from annihilation by the undersea bad guys ""I cant let you do that"" ... is all we get.

So, the movie was ok'ish, Mamoa did fine, but the writing let him down.  I'll still watch the sequels, but only when its free.",aquaman_2018,DC Extended Universe,Marvel Cinematic Universe,0,1,MonsterVerse,2,MonsterVerse,2,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Star Wars,3,DC Extended Universe,0
"Doctor Strange has some of the best visual effects used within the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Sadly it doesn't have the story or pacing to keep the movie going past that. With a subpar villain, side characters that are sent to the back of the line, and very slow build up of the story, this film is an easy one to forget about. While none of it is necessarily bad, none of Doctor Strange really sticks out past its visual. If going for a rewatch of the Marvel Cinematic Universe this one is iffy on its importance. It introduces a lot of concepts like the multiverse that will probably play a part in the future of the MCU at some point, but by that point we can hope it gets a better explanation possibly in Doctor Strange 2. For now though I would list this one under the skippable movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",doctor_strange_2016,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,DC Extended Universe,0,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1
Overall an okay movie. It had an extremely dumb villain and an absolutely meaningless ending that has zero impact on the MCU whatsoever. Definitely among the MCU's weakest additions.

"Doctor Stranges conjures up dazzling magic for Marvel's Cinematic Universe!

Director Scott Derrickson' superhero fantasy adventure Doctor Strange (2016) is a personal favorite Marvel movie for me. Since I was a child reading comic books, I have loved Doctor Strange as a superhero who brings magic, mysticism, and intelligence to the comic page. Scott Derrickson brought one of my favorite Avengers to life on the silver screen. Seeing Strange's magic made me nostalgic, but also pleasantly surprised me with the innovative choices in every beguiling sequence of mystic arts. Derrickson's darker, dramatic tone and intriguing mysteries left me wanting a sequel. I loved Doctor Strange! Doctor Strange remains in my top tier of Marvel movies thanks to Derrickson's inventive direction.

Scott Derrickson proves himself an intriguing and crafty American auteur with Sinister and Doctor Strange alone. Every scene is unexpected and original with a genuine sense of wonder over the magic Doctor Strange seeks out. From the craziest car crash I've ever seen straight out of the comic to Doctor Strange's creative deal with Dormmamu, Doctor Strange has very surprising magic tricks. Derrickson's direction has real heart for his charming characters and good humor as I was laughing plenty throughout Doctor Strange. I wish Derrickson was allowed to continue his vision for Doctor Strange's sequel, but alas, it was not meant to be I suppose. At least we'll always have Scott Derrickson's Doctor Strange.

Derrickson did justice for comic book writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko's classic run of Doctor Strange comics. Lee and Ditko gave us creative visuals with Doctor Strange defeating foes with his clever wit and inventive use of his magic powers. You see similar intelligent solutions to problems as Doctor Strange figures out refined methods to dispatch his curious enemies. I appreciate all the care and stellar craftsmanship that director Scott Derrickson brought to the creative table. 

Producers Stan Lee and Kevin Feige were smart to entrust Doctor Strange to Scott Derrickson, who clearly cared about this comic book superhero and interesting character. Writers Scott Derrickson, Jon Spaihts, and C. Robert Cargill delivers charming jokes, whimsical weird adventure, and magical spellcasting. Their words call upon Stephen Strange to learn humility instead of his arrogance, kindness instead of his selfishness, empathy for the pains of others instead of narcissitically making situations about himself, all with an air of seriousness.

Benedict Cumberbatch is fantastic as Dr. Stephen Strange, who becomes the wise and powerful superhero Doctor Strange. Cumberbatch is surprisingly fitting as a brilliant doctor, who is personally greedy, selfish, arrogant, and surly. He transforms into the focused, selfless, funny, gentle, loving, and miraculous Doctor Strange with an air of knowledge and confidence. He takes an unlikable man and turns him into a likable, cool superhero with wizard magic, medical prowess, and tender affections. I love seeing Cumberbatch's motioning around with his hands and arms to cast spells as Doctor Strange. He breathes life into the magic words he says with a serious realism, his booming deep voice, and Cumberbatch's commanding personality.

Rachel McAdams is gorgeous with the prettiest face I've ever seen. She's very charming as Strange's love interest and genius medical peer Dr. Christine Palmer. McAdams has actual romantic chemistry with Benedict Cumberbatch's initially emotionally closed off Stephen Strange. I found her scenes with Cumberbatch visceral in her emotional clarity for Palmer's character. She gets Strange to humanize by telling him how awful he's being, but giving him hope for a real loving life with her. If I had any critique of Doctor Strange, it is that I would like even more Rachel McAdams bonding romantically with Benedict Cumberbatch's Strange.

Chiwetel Ejiofor feels strong and smart as Baron Karl Mordo with his cautious warnings not to use magic against the natural laws. I'd love to see Ejiofor return as Doctor Strange's infamous archnemesis Baron Mordo. Benedict Wong is hilarious with his casual humor as Strange's supportive friend the librarian monk Wong. Mads Mikkelsen is fearsome and cool as Marvel supervillain Kaecilius. Mikkelsen's heavy gravitas brings a fierce darkness that stupefies you. He feels violent and determined, yet delivers lines with Mads' signature sly persona. I loved Mads Mikkelsen's scenes opposite Benedict Cumberbatch's Doctor Strange.

Tilda Swinton is very interesting and captivating as The Ancient One. She gives a likable and intense performance that really hammers home the hard lessons Strange must learn. Swinton is so careful with her every strange and subtle choice. Michael Stuhlbarg brings emotional realism to Doctor Strange as Dr. Nicodemus West. He starts out as a foolish and funny character, then gets a touching scene of redemption with Strange. Benjamin Bratt is gripping as the former paralyzed man Jonathan Pangborn. Scott Adkins' hand to hand fighting is impressive as usual as Lucian the Strong Zealot. Stan Lee has another funny cameo this time as a bus passenger. Chris Hemsworth has a quaint cameo as Thor Odinson you have to see!

Editors Sabrina Plisco and Wyatt Smith contain Doctor Strange's magic and mysticism down to a brisk 115 minutes long. Their sharp editing cuts between locations as Doctor Strange teleports around is very neat with tight edits splicing worlds in an instant. Between the character development and sharp bursts of Strange's magic, Doctor Strange never feels too long to me.

Cinematographer Ben Davis' imaginative ultra wide shots and intimate close-up shots captivate me. Davis' gorgeous and creative cinematography bring Doctor Strange's unique magical realms to life in stunning shots that use every angle, perspective, and framing trick imaginable. From the world folding over itself like in Christopher Nolan's Inception to magical beings pushing characters through space, Doctor Strange has its head in the stars with beautiful imagery that is unlike anything Marvel's movies has reached for before. Only Ant-Man and Guardians of the Galaxy have as ambitious a visual style akin to Scott Derrickson's direction and Ben Davis' cinematography for Doctor Strange.

Production designer Charles Wood's sets are very cool from Doctor Strange's warm and mysterious inner sanctum to the lavish CGI worlds Strange is visiting. Art directors Julian Ashby, Mike Stallion, Ray Chan, Michael Manson, Thomas Brown, Jordan Crockett, Mark Swain, Gary Jopling, Jim Barr, and Jason T. Clark captures a surreal psychedelic style for Doctor Strange. From the realistic scenes on Earth to the sudden magical encounters, Doctor Strange's entire aesthetic is right out of a painting. Set decorators John Bush and Stephen Christensen create antique looking furniture and ancient artifacts for Doctor Strange to peruse in his training and home.

Visual effects artists Stephane Ceretti, Jonathan Fawkner, Pimentel A. Raphael, Daryl Sawchuk, Nathan McConnel, Loren Robinson, Mathew Cowie, and Alexander Schumann astonish with Marvel's best looking CGI yet. Doctor Strange's magical abilities can be esoteric, so seeing his spells sparkling with breathtaking particle physics. From conjuring magical seals in air, opening portals to other cities, the vastness of Marvel's Multiverse of space, the unfathomable Dark Dimension, time reversing, to the hilarious cloak with its own personality. Doctor Strange is what CGI is capable of in the hands of real artists.

Composer Michael Giacchino, of Rogue One, Ratatouille, and Super 8 fame, writes Doctor Strange's score with a marvelous grandeur for the foreboding epic scenes of space and time bending. Giacchino's music is lovely, enthralling, and tender as needed for Doctor Strange's music cues. Giacchino's melodies can be so faint and affecting, then bombastic and mesmerizing.

Sound designers Tom Johnson, Shannon Mills, Juan Peralta, Daniel Laurie, David Chrastka, David C. Hughes, Nia Hansen, Josh Gold, and  J.R. Grubbs came up with all the neat loud pulsing sounds for Strange's magic powers I enjoyed.

Costume designer Alexandra Byrne modernizes the look of Doctor Strange's comic book wizard robes with a brilliant red cape and flowing blue layers. I like the spots of gold too. Doctor Strange definitely has one of Marvel's coolest superhero designs. Everyone on Earth looks remarkably normal, thus Doctor Strange stands out even more besides the other sorcerers.

Make-up artists Jeremy Woodhead, Sharon Martin, Nicola Buck, Donald McInnes, Björn Rehbein, Susan Howard, Jessica Brooks, and Malwina Suwinska provide natural nice looks for everyone. I love that they gave Benedict Cumberbatch Strange's goatee and graying side hair. He looks distinguished. Tilda is convincingly made bald as The Ancient One. Mads' eye make-up is really neat.

In all, Doctor Strange is a well crafted superhero film from Scott Derrickson. I really adore Benedict Cumberbatch and Rachel McAdams and hope to see them again soon as Doctor Stephen Strange and Dr. Christine Palmer, respectively.",doctor_strange_2016,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1
"Seriously, how can a movie about one of the greatest and most well known teams in the comics is this bad? This is the same sentence that I've used when talking about Fant4stic. Yes, I'm comparing this to Fant4stic.

"If the Phantom Menace, aka ""Episode 1"", had been the first Star Wars movie released  rather than the fourth, there likely wouldn't have been an Episode 2. It's a talky, effects-crammed dud, which somehow manages to turn the exciting galaxy-spanning world of Star Wars into ""C-Span in Space"" between battle scenes. Awful writing and directing seem to be the culprits in the failure of this movie in spite of the talents of some of its cast. 

That it's visually often very busy and at times stunning aren't enough on their own, having neither a good script nor a capable director. Cramming CGI effects into many of its scenes looks like a sign of desperation as the producers tried to make it interesting in some way. 

Bad acting and peculiar dialog abound. Sure, Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor are in it, and doing their best to rise above the abysmal script, but they can't save the clunker. And somehow, some strange force has neutralized the acting skills of Natalie Portman so she sounds as stiff as Jake Lloyd, a wooden little character who fails to become a real boy by the end of this overly long ordeal. 

Why we need to see an uneducated slave child who evidently is a genius at creating droids (who happen to be important characters in Episode IV but who seem to have entirely forgotten him by that point in the timeline) is anybody's guess. 

Then there's the pedophile aspect of having teenage Natalie Portman meeting the young child she would later get into bed with. ""Are you an angel?"", the little wooden boy asks. Far from it, little boy. She's more like one of those crazy schoolteachers who ends up with a teary-eyed mug shot because she couldn't keep her hands off the students.  

My brother defends this movie with a lame argument about Darth Maul being a great character. Sure, he looks cool, and he's in a terrific fight scene, but his few minutes onscreen can't save this turkey. In response to my brother's flimsy single-character-based defense, I present Exhibit A, the Gungans and their primary representative, JarJar Binks. The whole Gungan species seems to have come straight from a minstrel show, and JarJar is the absolute worst of their lot, being an alien version of Stepin Fetchit.  Simpering, weak and afraid of his own shadow, and jabbering with a quasi-Caribbean accent, every scene with JarJar is in some way offensive. ""Me's a JarJar Binks"", indeed.

George Lucas has said he'd like to buy up all the copies of ""The Star Wars Holiday Special"" and make that movie disappear. To be fair, the Holiday Special has that train wreck fascination quality and so a lot of fans love it. ""The Phantom Menace"" is the Star Wars movie he should erase from history. Or at least one of them - but I'm not going to talk about ""Attack of the Clones"" or ""Revenge of the Sith"" here.",star_wars_episode_i_the_phantom_menace,Star Wars,Star Wars,3,3,Star Wars,3,Star Wars,3,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Star Wars,3,Star Wars,3

"I enjoyed the darker tone that this film explored and there were several legitimately emotional moments. Tom Hiddleston, as always, was the standout here. However, Thor and Jane's relationship was not especially believable to me, undermining the central tension of the movie.

The movie is good enough to watch it a Sunday afternoon with your little nephew, but it felt like a wasted opportunity, Marvel could have actually build a good story instead of only using this movie as a bridge for Avengers Endgame.",ant_man_and_the_wasp,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1
"The plot was engaging and felt like any other Star Wars story, which is meant in a somewhat positive way, however the dialogue, and in particular the way the voice work was edited, sounded pretty bad.

"The first Captain America film was a lot of fun, and 'Winter Soldier', taking a bigger, bolder and darker approach while not forgetting the entertainment value, was even better.

'Civil War' is not quite as good as 'Winter Soldier' but it's a little better than the first film, in my opinion. It may not be quite the spectacular extravaganza that this reviewer was expecting from reading the critics' reviews, but it is very solid fun still, great entertainment and in the top end of Marvel's output even with its faults.

Granted, 'Civil War' is not perfect, so the detractors can think again before accusing me of being someone paid to write a positive review. This is actually somebody who saw the film, enjoyed it thoroughly but realises that it has flaws. Is anybody going to point out to Marvel detractors that people can enjoy Marvel's films without feeling like it's a criminal offence to and have been giving good reasons for doing so, so parroting out ridiculous and easily disproven conspiracy theories that have often come close to violating terms and conditions is only making them look like the idiots and the ignoramuses? Sorry to point out that irrelevant note, but this attitude keeps cropping up in the increasing user and critical condescension wave that IMDb is facing, and IMDb who seem shockingly oblivious to it should come down harder on it.

As with what was not quite right with 'Civil War', there is an over-stuffed and occasionally under-cooked feel at times. 'Civil War' has many subplots and characters, and while actually it deals with a vast majority of the subplots and characters are dealt with incredibly well there are a few subplots that appear (a couple of them abruptly introduced as well) and not enough is done with them, as far as being completely forgotten about after ten minutes or being rushed through to get to the next one. Zemo's story is lost within everything else and would have fared better within a film all on its own, because the potential was there. A vast majority of the characters are all interesting with engaging, in-depth personalities, but War Machine is somewhat side-lined, while one appreciates the complexity given to Zemo there was the sense that he wasn't as completely crucial to the main story as he could have been and while Spiderman really grows on you his entrance is a bit clumsily done and makes one think does he really belong?

However, 'Civil War' also does a huge amount right. It looks amazing for a start, the gritty but audacious look of 'Winter Soldier' makes a welcome return while the cinematography is stylish, the editing crisp (if slightly and occasionally confused in the airport action sequence) and the special effects as extravagant as they should, helped by thunderously authentic sound. Despite really not being a fan of shaky cam usually, it is not abused here, doesn't cause visual discomfort and gave certain scenes even more raw tension than they already had. The music again has much rousing excitement and haunting intensity while being no less memorable than the music in the previous two outings.

The action sequences in 'Civil War' are strong too. The opening sequence starts the film with a bang, with its tragic consequences being genuinely affecting, while the airport scene is tense, enormous fun and thrilling (though because with so much going on, the camera/editing does at times struggle to keep up). Best of all is the climax, which had much more intensity and was surprisingly rich in conflict and emotion. The direction is astute and deftly balances all the different conflicts and tone shifts, while the script is very smartly written with the light-hearted moments like with Spiderman and Ant-Man being witty and hilarious while not once being at odds with the more thought-provoking and serious elements (which never get bogged down in too much talk). The story, while a bit over-stuffed and under-cooked in places, is never dull, never feels too stretched or thin, always makes sense (even with parts that needed more development) and is endlessly riveting right up to the end, which is an achievement for a two and a half hour film with this much going on. Likewise, while some characters are more interesting than others (which is standard for any film with a cast as large as this), the characters are very intriguingly and engagingly written with distinct personalities and realism.

There are great performances across the board, with the one oddity being Marisa Tomei as Aunt May, not a big role but not small enough to give the impression that Tomei in age and manner did not fit the character. Much of the film however is dominated by Robert Downey Jnr and Chris Evans, both of whom are note-perfect as Iron Man and Captain America. Elizabeth Olsen is flawed but sympathetic, Scarlett Johansson is wonderfully fearless, Paul Rudd is a breath of fresh air with his introduction actually feeling like a character who belongs, Tom Holland brings endearing enthusiasm to Spiderman, Paul Bettany and Sebastian Stan are authoritative presences, Daniel Bruhl has the right degree of arrogance and is able to convey menace while only doing as little as a whisper and Chadwick Boseman characterises Black Panther's wounded pride with dignity and gravitas.

Overall, very solid fun if just missing out on being the spectacular extravaganza expected. 8/10 Bethany Cox",captain_america_civil_war,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1
"Overrated but still good. This is by no means top tier MCU, but it does have some amazing elements. Sebastian Stan, Chris Evans and Scarlett Johansonn really become their characters in this film.

The villain(s) are not done well, the CGI can be an eyesore, and the story is very predictable. The goals and motivations to do things don't make much sense, and the plot conveniences are extremely abundant. About the only good thing in this entire film was the humor, which I thought was done well thanks to the charm of the cast.

There was enough exposure for the supporting female characters, but personally, I still wish they had better costumes. Ewan McGregor did a great job as the main villain, Black Mask. Plot was quite straightforward. It's really the fast-paced stunts and Margot Robbie's undeniable charm that makes this movie worth watching. You have to suspend your disbelief for this one because it's full of  incredible stunts and chase scenes.

Chris Prat's character, ""Star Lord"" is one of the funniest characters in the marvel universe. He manages to play a funny and cool role causing comedic relief at the most crucial and serious times.

"I am a late arrival to the Avengers scene, but I was able to observe all the hype directed towards this move as it was happening. Was this movie deserving of the hype? Was it a satisfying conclusion to the Infinity saga that has dominated movie screens for 3 presidential administrations? I would say the answer is yes to both those questions.

First off, this movie is king and barely has downtime. The fighting itself doesn't take up the majority of the screen time, but the plot is constantly moving forward. I was quite surprised how the plot mostly focused on undoing Thanos's actions from the previous movie rather than defeating him. His character is dealt with quite early in the movie, so his return at the end was welcome. 

The thing the movie does best is show the respect due to its characters that have been with them since the beginning. The new(er) characters get plenty of time to shine, but the veteran characters are really front and center. Also, this movie is not afraid to kill off characters you love. It feels like the directors knew we were mature enough to understand that not everyone can have a happy ending all the time. 

The only downside of this movie is how many previous details you have to remember from the tons of movies that came before it. I understand you can't spoon feed your audience every little detail, but man, there are a lot of characters and plot lines you have to remember if you're going to get every detail spelled out in this movie. All-in-all, this was a fantastic movie.

"Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald is a rather weak follow-up movie. In spite of having a great cast, the movie lacks the usual sense of wonder and magic that previous installments have offered. I do love how the cast included Hollywood royalties like Johnny Depp and Jude Law. Eddie Redmayne is a great actor. Like Depp, he has been given serious and offbeat roles in the past, and he's been showing excellence in his craft. Ezra Miller, on the other hand, needs to step up his acting. The movie is well-directed, and just like in the Harry Potter series, the musical score beautifully sets the different moods of the story. There are many things that were mentioned and introduced in this movie that would connect it to the previous Harry Potter installments. Though I'd have to agree with some friends that non-fans/readers might have a lot of questions when they watch this prequel.

"The original trilogy of Star Wars contain three films, all of which are sophisticated, imaginative and enormous fun. I feared it wouldn't be my thing, but it was exactly that. I loved the original trilogy for all those reasons. Empire Strikes Back maintains all the fun of its predecessor, while even darker and more mature. Visually it's a marvel to look at, with the stunning special effects and highly imaginative-looking sets. John Williams's score is just outstanding, epic and monumental in every way. The story is darker than that of New Hope and perhaps more sophisticated, and I loved the fact the filmmakers made the romance between Leia and Han more developed. The battle sequences are mesmerising, the beginning is bound to have you on the edge of your seat, but the battle between Luke and Darth Vader was simply out of this world. The script is still as affectionate as ever, the pace is fast and the acting is great. Mark Hamill is ever as likable as Luke, and Carrie Fisher still has her spunk and vivacity. Harrison Ford is noticeably more subdued, but he is still terrific, and Frank Oz is a perfect Yoda. Chewabacca is hilarious, and Darth Vader is a fantastic villain, especially when voiced so magnificently by James Earl Jones.

"A film that relies on MCU quips and basic structure instead of doing anything different. I love the MCU but there needs to be more to a film than this.

Special effects were well done while not being the star (as is the norm in far too many movies in recent years).

"'Kong: Skull Island' has once again shown that in this cinematic monster universe, the VFX created monsters are the best characters that can be developed throughout their film. This second installment of the monster universe after the first 'Godzilla' proves to be almost an exact copy. Audiences are given a monster where half of the cast wishes to kill it and the others understand and empathize with it. Only this time, there is some more development within certain characters such as John C. Reilly's character which had the best lines and most in-depth story. Unfortunately no one else on screen truly shined. Samuel L. Jackson did a great job, but was unsympathetic towards audiences with his character's personality and decisions.

Yes, I think so. It is a very well made and efficiently directed film, with wonderful costumes, effects and settings and the cinematography and editing also impress. The music is rousing, and I just love Star Spangled Man, one of Alan Menken's best songs in my opinion. The script is witty and smart. Cheesy also? Perhaps but in an endearing sort of way. The story has a strong start, but loses its way to sluggish pacing and clichés in the final act. The characters are clichéd too in a sense but like the actors are engaging. Chris Evans is perfect in the title role, and he is joined by sassy Hayley Atwell and a wonderfully gruff Tommy Lee Jones. Hugo Weaving wasn't quite there for me, he is a great actor and he is charismatic and menacing, but his accent is inconsistent and the character could have been delved into more.

"This was my first Star Wars film that I watched in cinemas as a child. I had seen ANH and Empire on TV (42cm CRT) and was already a huge fan, but after seeing it on the big screen I was hooked! This was a great way to finish the OG story and say goodbye to the characters. There was room for sequels, but they should have been done in the 2000's after the prequels were finished, not so late that Luke looked like a great grandfather. That way they could have used the EU as direct source material. That being said, I enjoyed the sequels for what they were, and am loving what Disney is doing with expanding the galaxy on Disney+.

"After all these years and all these MCU movies, things are finally starting to pay off. Thanos is a character that audiences can't help but be interested in. Unfortunately, the movie feels very disjointed. Because there's so many characters, it can be awhile before we check in on a character we had earlier in the movie. That's not necessarily an issue in itself, but sometimes their actions are forgettable, so you have to remind yourself what they're even doing. There's a big focus on the Guardians of the Galaxy which I like, but they definitely get a lot of screen time compared to other Avenger veterans. Tom Holland and RDJ have great chemistry. Their characters work very well together. CGI can he kind of hit or miss depending on the scene. All-in-all, this is a very good movie that is leading to a heart-stopping conclusion, and I would definitely recommend this movie to others.",avengers_infinity_war,Marvel Cinematic Universe,MonsterVerse,1,2,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1

"Captain America takes on spies!

Directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo's superhero espionage thriller Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) is very enthralling. I finally get the hype around the majority of audiences saying that The Winter Soldier is one of Marvel's greatest movies. The Russo Brothers capture thrilling action sequences with complex hand to hand combat for both Captain America and Black Widow that makes them look like excellently trained fighters. 

Producers Stan Lee and Kevin Feige were smart to entrust The Russo's with Captain America's second solo film. I loved that most of The Winter Soldier focuses on Captain America and Black Widow as these two Avengers superheroes make for the most interesting and believable spies for America through S.H.I.E.L.D.

I personally appreciate Anthony and Joe Russo making a proper espionage thriller with real spy work and political intrigue as Hydra invades S.H.I.E.L.D. with covert tactics, hidden computers, and secretive files. It's very cool to see Marvel's Cinematic Universe give Captain America a chance to defend America with modern espionage skills alongside his awesome combat prowess. 

Writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely really came up with a neat spy narrative of Hydra's layered infiltration of S.H.I.E.L.D. from senators to soldiers alike. Their intricate spy story is fascinating as they blend sleeper cell agents like The Winter Soldier with Hydra's human experimentation and war mongering. They breathe life into Captain America's values as a patriotic American and moral man desiring a peaceful life. I was sincerely touched by the Steve Rogers segments where he goes to the Captain America museum exhibit to reminisce on old familiar sights, while deciding if he could ever date a woman that is not Agent Peggy Carter.

Chris Evans is really heartfelt as Steve Rogers and inspiring as ever as Captain America. Evans plays up Rogers' emotions seeing Hayley Atwell's Peggy Carter once more alongside Bucky in unfavorable circumstances. You completely understand and empathize with his conflicted ideals and feelings. Chris Evans embodies Captain America's kind spirit, steadfast bravery, and inspiring perseverance. Chris Evans is handsome, charming, funny, gentle, moving, strong, and likable as Captain America. Clearly a career defining role and performance from him.

Scarlett Johansson is breathtakingly gorgeous as Black Widow as he takes out men like they're nothing in battle after battle. Scarlett's Natasha Romanoff charms with her sultry flirting and playful teasing of Steve Rogers. She's got great chemistry with Chris Evans and fits the espionage information seeking and cute romantic flirting. I am amazed by her Black Widow fight sequences with crazy acrobatic combat choreography besides her cool gadgets and quick thinking. Scarlett is simply charming and lovable as the former Soviet spy, who admires and befriends Captain America. Scarlett's Natasha Romanoff feels genuine, friendly, funny, and intelligent with her serious dramatic acting and subtle facial nuances. Scarlett Johansson will forever be one of Hollywood's finest actresses. I love her Black Widow in every Marvel movie thus far including Iron Man 2, The Avengers, and Captain America: The Winter Soldier.

Hayley Atwell is genuine as ever as Peggy Carter with a wondrously touching scene with Chris Evans. I wish Marvel had given Agent Carter a proper role. Robert Redford is captivating as Alexander Pierce as he monologues about human safety and spy necessity. He feels right back in place with his subtle espionage acting like in 3 Days of the Condor or All the President's Men. Samuel L. Jackson is fantastically gripping as S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Nick Fury with his ethics speeches and motivational guidance for Captain America. His action scenes are really clever too. Toby Jones could not be more fun with just his distinct voice. Jones is always a staple of spy thrillers.

Sebastian Stan is fearsome and brooding as The Winter Soldier. You can feel Bucky's confusion and determination as he kills person after person, while wondering who Captain America is to him. Anthony Mackie's Sam Wilson is funny and sincere as a patient veteran counselor, while also coming across as helpful and cool as Falcon. 

Cobie Smulders is wonderful as S.H.I.E.L.D's stalwart Agent Maria Hill with her sharpshooting and natural gravitas as a leader. Emily VanCamp is lovely and sweet as Sharon Carter. Her Agent 13 feels skillful and reliable with honest morals like Cap. Frank Grillo is easy to hate as Brock Rumlow. Garry Shandling's cameo is very funny. Stan Lee and Joe Russo's cameos are neat. Cool to see Elizabeth Olsen and Aaron Taylor-Johnson already before Age of Ultron.

Editors Jeffrey Ford and Matthew Schmidt continue a fast pace for 136 minutes of sharp cuts. The action flows nicely and the heavy dialogue of espionage exposition never lets you get lost with their natural edits. Cinematographer Trent Opaloch gives us steadfast wide shots for action and conversations so we see everything. I loved all the close-up shots and medium shots here with a real sleek look. All the sets, props, CGI, and sound design is impressive.

Composer Henry Jackman's score for The Winter Soldier is an adrenaline rush for the action sequences, while creating a moody atmosphere for all the spy thriller elements. The espionage is the main plot and Jackman's tense music contributes a lot of emotion. Costume designer Judianna Makovsky creates slick uniforms for Black Widow, Captain America, and The Winter Soldier.

In all, Captain America: The Winter Soldier remains thought provoking about government power extending too far and shadow games carried out by assassins and spies alike. I love the character development for Steve Rogers and Natasha Romanoff. The Russo Brothers pull off some of Marvel's most engaging action scenes with Captain America and Black Widow. The Winter Soldier stayed with me as a formidable espionage thriller and well made film.",captain_america_the_winter_soldier_2014,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1
"Having been one of the biggest success films ever is its gift and its curse. It's a grandiose and unforgettable visual spectacle, it has the most creative shots in the MCU, the action scenes are shocking and some characters have their best roles in this film.
All mentioned is the gift of the movie and the curse is that it has our full attention only in that aspects, because the film has a great script, round, complete and with great value, but they almost force you to ignore the story as such and just enjoy the fights.

"While the movie is very entertaining and fun to watch, it does feel like it could have done with one more draft before being finalized. While no glaring faults in Birds of Prey, it does still give a sense that it is lacking, and some more scenes with characters outside of Harley Quinn could have been added. The film seems to be a Harley Quinn movie with the Bird of Prey tacked on at the last minute, leaving the characters outside of Harley Quinn and the main antagonist Roman Sionis in the background most of the time. Hopefully the Bird of Prey themselves can get their own movie in the future to fix this only downside to the movie.",birds_of_prey_2020,DC Extended Universe,Marvel Cinematic Universe,0,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1

"Absolutely amazing Ant-Man antics and innovative science-fiction!

Director Peyton Reed's superhero science-fiction comedy Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018) is just as hilarious and creative as Ant-Man. Reed's direction makes great use of his villain Ghost's phasing in and out of reality alongside Ant-Man and the Wasp's shrinking powers. The final battle is as creative and clever as any Marvel encounter. I love Peyton Reed's Ant-Man movies as he directs character driven storytelling with intimate drama and cute romance.

The way Reed brings high concept sci-fi to life with the Quantum Realm is surreal and has Marvel's greatest visuals and CGI besides Doctor Strange. From colorful worlds outside of time, shrinking cars and buildings, to drumming ants, Ant-Man and the Wasp really has it all in terms of striking and playful visuals.  I'm so glad producers Stan Lee and Kevin Feige allowed Peyton Reed to do what he wants as he runs the gambit of new ideas for Ant-Man to mess around with in Reed's phenomenal Ant-Man and the Wasp.

Writers Paul Rudd, Andrew Barrer, Chris McKenna, Erik Sommers, and Gabriel Ferrari came up with very funny jokes, pleasant vibes, and uplifting messages. Ant-Man and the Wasp's themes of fatherhood, motherhood, love, trust, friendship, change, forgiveness, and ethics. I love their surreal science-fiction ideas about The Quantum Realm, time travel, matter phrasing, body enlargement, building shrinking, and molecular state stabilizing. I appreciate how seriously they figured out all this fictional science with real scientific terms and logic. The way these brilliantly innovative writers play around with these concepts through Ant-Man's powers. The Ghost plotline is as thoughtful as the Quantum Realm one mixed in with Scott Lang's house arrest subplot. It's a blast of multiple storylines.

Editors Craig Wood and Dan Lebental use all these fast cuts of Wasp switching between human and wasp sizes in fights around the restaurant and van chase sequences. I'm amazed by the final fight between The Ghost against Ant-Man and the Wasp. Wood and Lebental know exactly when to transition in their montages and scenes between Ant-Man or Wasp's perspectives, so that we always feel engaged within scenes in equal time between Marvel's hero and heroine. Cinematographer Dante Spinotti's shots use inventive framing and multiple perspectives for Ant-Man and the Wasp's stunning cinematography. Every wide shot of Hank Pym's lab shrinking or growing is breathtaking. I loved how Spinotti's medium and close-up shots always feel emotionally in tune with Reed's characters.

Paul Rudd is so charming, endearing, and hilarious as Scott Lang the Ant-Man. Rudd's Lang feels like the kindest and most fun dad ever with an easy going personality and positive attitude that's fun to watch. Rudd is always funny and surprisingly cool as the skilled improviser Ant-Man. Paul Rudd really is a fantastic Avenger. Evangeline Lilly is gorgeous and awesome as Wasp. Her fights as Wasp are so creative, intense, and varied. Lilly is a lovely love interest for Rudd as they have a cute innocent romantic chemistry. I like how Hope van Dyne just wanted to be invited to fight alongside Ant-Man by Scott Lang during Civil War and that's all she was really upset about in the start. I want more of Paul Rudd's Scott Lang and Evangeline Lilly's Hope van Dyne's adorable romantic comedy and tender romance drama from Ant-Man and the Wasp.

Michael Peña's Luis babbles incessantly much to my delight. His endless stories and concerned faces are very funny. He even gets a cool fast car chase sequence. T.I. has this lackadaisical persona as Dave that's quite funny, especially opposite David Dastmalchian's paranoid Russian Kurt. Walton Goggins is fun as this sleazy Southern gentleman villain black market merchant Sonny Burch. Judy Greer's sweet Maggie is funny as she is indignant about the FBI raiding Scott's home. Bobby Cannavale's police officer Paxton is a supportive husband and funnily defends the FBI's invading rights.

Hannah John-Kamen's sympathetic antagonist Ava Starr is breathtaking and moving. I love her Ghost character's strange powers that are totally unique to Ant-Man's universe. Her passionate dialogue delivery is gripping alongside Ghost's sudden appearances. I would love to see Hannah John-Kamen return as Ava Starr the Ghost. Abby Ryder Fortson is cute and fun as Scott Lang's daughter Cassie, who wants to grow up to be Wasp. Randall Park's cavalier FBI agent Jimmy Woo is rather endearing and funny. I'd be happy to see him return.

Michael Douglas steals every scene as the stern genius Hank Pym, the original Ant-Man. Douglas' flippant disdain for Scott Lang's jokes and flirting with his beloved daughter Hope. Michelle Pfeiffer is emotionally compelling as the first Wasp and Hope's lost mother Janet van Dyne. Laurence Fishburne is intelligent, sly, and intriguing as the thoughtful Dr. Bill Foster the Goliath. Comedian Tim Heidecker's whale tour guide cameo is hilarious just like Gregg Turkington's cameo from the first Ant-Man. Stan Lee's cameo as a former hippie is very funny.

Production designer Shepherd Frankel created a fancy set and high tech lab for Hank Pym. The Ghost's manor is very pretty too, just like Scott Lang's warm house set. Set decorators Gene Serdena, Dean Wolcott, Tammy S. Lee, Jeff Markwith, Christopher J. Wood, Tyler Wallace, Jenny Sandell, Daniela Medeiros, Vincent Bates, Colton Comans, Patrick Dunn-Baker, Sam Carter, Terry Hill, Scott Johnson, Blade Ladish, A.J. Caulfield, Gregg Perez, Katie Childs, A.J. Austin, Molly Ebner, Duncan Fletcher, Robbie Sammons, Christian Hoobyar, and Stewart D. Allen furnishes Lang's cozy home and Pym's Quantum laboratory with cute furniture and tons of scientific gear for realism.

Art directors Domenic Silvestri, Michael E. Goldman, Clint Wallace, Jay Pelissier, Susan Alegria, Calla Klessig, Rachel Block, Andy Chung, Mari Lappalainen, Kiel Gookin, Julian Scalia, Margaux Wilcox, and Colleen Larson outdid themselves for The Quantum Realm's artful scenes like the stylish shots for Ant-Man's transformations. Costume designers Louise Frogley and Valerie White's superhero uniforms for Ant-Man, Wasp, and The Ghost are super cool and stylish. You can immediately tell them apart even in motion. Make-up artists Valli O'Reilly, Heba Thorisdottir, Björn Rehbein, Jillian Erickson, Seidah Nichols, and Hil Cook give Evangeline Lilly and Hannah John-Kamen an ethereal look.

Composer Christophe Beck's score combines melodic symphonies and pulsing electronic synths for Ant-Man and the Wasp. Ant-Man's theme song is triumphant as is Wasp's theme. I love how sound mixers have the music fade in and out during dramatic cues. Sound designers David Farmer, Tom Johnson, Shannon Mills, Juan Peralta, Lee Gilmore, Addison Teague, Douglas Murray, Katy Wood, and Steve Orlando use all manner of noises and sound effects for the body transformations and matter shifting. Everything sounds just otherworldly enough to let you know how unusual Ant-Man abilities are among the Avengers.

In conclusion, Ant-Man and the Wasp immediately jumps up to one of my favorite Marvel movies. The frenetic action, stunning CGI, endearing characters, quaint jokes, and crafty  science-fiction ideas are something else.",ant_man_and_the_wasp,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,1,DC Extended Universe,0,MonsterVerse,2,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,DC Extended Universe,0,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1
"I could easily see how most people would think this movie lesser than its predecessor and to a certain degree it is.

"Star Wars: Episode 1- The Phantom Menace is definitely worth a watch, but I do think it is one of the weaker movies of the Star Wars saga. I will admit I wasn't expecting much after reading some very negative reviews on IMDb, but I do think this particular instalment did in some ways exceed my expectations and disappointed as well. On a visual and technical level, it looks absolutely fantastic, with splendid special effects, stunning cinematography and fine scenery and costumes. The script is fairly decent, perhaps lacking the sophistication of Empire Strikes Back or New Hope, but does have some memorable lines. The action is constantly exhilarating, and Darth Maul, well played by Ray Park is a very good villain. Of course though, Darth Vader is better. Most of the performances are very good, especially Natalie Portman as Queen Padma who looked stunning and Jake Lloyd as Anakin Skywalker who shone with his confident charm. And Jar Jar Binks is okay on the most part, and you have to love Yoda. And the music score by John Williams was outstanding, definitely one of his best works. The quality of sound and direction are also impressive. However, there were things about this film that did disappoint. One is despite the awesome visuals, strong music score and good characters, the story never quite distinguished itself. It did take a while to get going, and when it did try to get going and you could tell it wanted to, it was further disadvantaged by the uneven pacing. Liam Neeson is a fine actor, his performances in Kinsey and Schindler's List are proof of that, and I do like Ewan McGregor. But as Qui-Gon Jin and Obi Wan Kenobi, both stars give unusually wooden performances, and at times looked even embarrassed. And as I said, the pacing is very uneven, there are some slow moments, and one or two scenes felt rushed. All in all, maybe disappointing for fans of the saga, but it cannot be denied that visually it is an accomplishment. 7/10 Bethany Cox",star_wars_episode_i_the_phantom_menace,Star Wars,Star Wars,3,3,Star Wars,3,Star Wars,3,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Star Wars,3,Star Wars,3
"The MCU wants to talk about death and the end of existence... Personally, I think it fails. Marvel movies aim to entertain the public, because of that they don't try to be as serious in Doctor Strange as they should with this kind of heavy themes. Everything feels shallow about it but you still left with a bad aftertaste because having to think about death while watching what you were expecting to be a simple entertainment. 
It must be one of the most impressive special effects ever been in a movie, the way they play with psychedelic moment, optical illusion, mirror effect is breath taking. The only flaw here with the CGI is the final confrontation that doesn't feel as polished or thoughtful as the rest of the movie.

It's a Marvel movie, they know their formula so you will be entertain but neither the main conflict or antagonist feels very important.",doctor_strange_2016,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1
"Thor The Dark World has a lot of potential by getting into a deeper history of Asguard and the nine realms, but just manages to miss every step it takes. Aside from some moments where we get to see Thor and Loki interact, the movie is a bland plot with an even blander bad guy, after a power source that is better explained in later films. If there are movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe that can be skipped without missing out on anything, Thor The Dark World is at the top of that list. On any kind of Marvel Cinematic Universe rewatch I suggest skipping this one under any and all circumstances.",thor_the_dark_world,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1

If you're a fan of Shang Chi in the comics I'm sure you'll get more out of this film than I did, but overall I felt it was very mediocre.",shang_chi_and_the_legend_of_the_ten_rings,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,1,DC Extended Universe,0,DC Extended Universe,0,MonsterVerse,2,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,DC Extended Universe,0
"(VERY CLOSE TOO SPIDER-MAN: HOMECOMING)

In Spider-man Far from home, there are a lot more funny scenes and great laughs, along with even more action packed scenes. It's just as good as Spider-man homecoming. The ending took me by complete shock, but in a great way. Tom Holland and Zendaya's performances are great and they are on top of their game as actors in this movie. Superhero fans will love this movie just as much as they've loved the Spider-Man Homecoming movie. With both of the two movies combined I definetely want too see Spider-Man: No Way Home. These are the kind of movies that are worth seeing in the movie theaters, and if Tom Holland and Zendaya ever do another Spider-Man movie, I will be seeing it in the movie theater. I'm very impressed by what they did. This time around the story was just as good and that's why I give it an amazing star rating. I love the glasses that Tom Holland gets as Peter Parker/Spider-man and everyone did a great job with the bus scene, when they drive too Prog,  that scene is funny and filled with action. I highly recommend this movie too any true Superhero Fan.

"The trailer was very clear on the tone of the film, and within the first 20 mins. you'll figure out the extent of the shallow plot. It's a no-brainer action film that's not particularly interested in attempting to base anything in realism (to be fair, we're talking about a giant, laser-beam shooting lizard fighting a huge monkey – what do you expect?) and frequently falls back onto the ol' pull-an-explanation-outta-your-ass technique for what's happening. That being said, it's visually spectacular and features large-scale fight scenes that tend to demolish everything within the vicinity (the final battle is pretty darn epic) and that's exactly what you came for. It's almost ‘Pacific Rim' and director Adam Wingard has obviously taken inspiration from it in a number of ways. It's just a bit of very silly fun, it was never trying to be anything else.",godzilla_vs_kong,MonsterVerse,Marvel Cinematic Universe,2,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,DC Extended Universe,0,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,DC Extended Universe,0
"It was all great and all but for me it's overrated, it could of used more action and more character dialogue, I wished they could of used more music from the other spiderman characters, they made it a bit cheesy and corny with some of the actors, Andrew was such a load of bread and I wish it was more chilling and dramatic with- I don't know it was more of a take what I can get of a movie everyone wished for, If Zack Snyder would of directed this he would of added more scenery, dialogue, action, ect. I loved how some of the villains turn out to be good as it can be, But I was very disappointed of how when it got near the ending I felt like ""so was that it?"" Not even a little bit of an chilling action scene, Plus they used way too much time to get all of the characters, maybe an extra hour wouldn't be so bad like Endgame for example, But it's a movie I can't complain and I'd say it's a great movie but not for me, take care guys.",spider_man_no_way_home,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,1,Star Wars,3,DC Extended Universe,0,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,MonsterVerse,2,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1
"I was interested in seeing this ever since it came out. After finally seeing it I am so glad I did. It is a visually stunning film with excellent cinematography and editing and the costumes, settings and effects look wonderful. There may be the odd longueur in the plot, with a little too much of admiring the scenery, but most of it is amusing and while not sticking true to the original source material there are a lot of nods to it. Kenneth Branagh directs superbly, the action is earth-shattering and the script is filled with witty fish-out-of-water moments. The acting is fine with Chris Hemsworth giving his all in the role, Anthony Hopkins bringing some welcome gravitas to Odin rather than hamming up, Natalie Portman more than a pretty face and Tom Hiddleston's Loki a villain worth watching for.

"Spiderman was completely incompetent compared to the previous films, the narrative was too tied in to the Avengers franchise, and the villain was pathetic. Moreover, the plot was predictable and none of the action stood out. Some characters lacked believability, and the constant comedic dialogue was unnatural.

"The first time I watched this movie I liked a lot of it and didn't understand why everyone kept saying it was so bad, and on second viewing I still hold most of the same views as before. The movie has a lot going on, and for the most part it is all well done. The points of Hammer Industries could be removed and there would be no loss to the film, and the ending falls flat for what the rest of the film is setting up. There is a lot of potential in this movie, but it just wasn't all met in the same way the first film came together. It also introduces a lot of characters and ideals that would follow suit in the Marvel Cinematic Universe going forward. While it isn't as good as the first Iron Man movie, it does hold up as a very well done sequel, and is still leagues better than Iron Man 3 which I will get to soon enough.",iron_man_2,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,DC Extended Universe,0
"Avengers Age of Ultron is a passable movie, it isn't the best that the Marvel Cinematic Universe has to offer, but it also isn't the worst. There are plenty of great scenes that hold the movie up, but they tend to get pulled down by problems that are the center point of the movie. Ultron is probably one of the weaker villains, when he should be one of the best. Watching the Avengers work together, and banter is still as fun as it was during the first movie, but the charm of the first movie has faded with this one. I can't recommend going back and watching this movie personally, I know that it is a mixed bag as this movie has a lot of fans, I am just not one of them even after a second viewing. The movie isn't bad but is just isn't good either. If going for a rewatch of the Marvel Cinematic Universe this movie does bring forth a lot of plot points that drive the team going forward so it is important to watch, but it might not be the worst idea to skip it as well or watch a recap of the movie online.",avengers_age_of_ultron,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,DC Extended Universe,0,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,DC Extended Universe,0
"As a writer who must trust his instincts about a film, I went into viewing this picture on Disney+ with the hope of having an experience that would leave me uplifted. To my dismay, those instinctual voices informed me, about halfway through the film - that this was not going to be the case. One sequence in particular, onboard the Eternal's mothership The Domo, during Thena's battles, the voice of those subconscious instincts would not stop hammering home the point that this movie should have been titled, 'The Immortal Nature of Lies and Betrayal'. It is tough living forever (at 66, I feel I can speak - SOMEWHAT, to this dilemma), and it will be even tougher for this franchise to continue to trudge down the path that it has chosen in the face of declining enthusiasm for the genre.
It was the post-Avengers break-out franchise for Marvel Studios, so it needed new blood. Their choice of director was a gallant and insightful move on the studio's part, knowing all the while they were going to hamstring this fresh new Academy Award winning auteur. It is sad to see the sprigs of a budding artist's blooms wither in the chill of an early Spring frost. Marvel has a history of doing this sort of thing; hiring bright minds with vision only to constrain that vision with production schedules, budget limitations and dumbed-down script rewrites. But once again the industry Goliath, Disney, has achieved success in the realm of mediocrity for the bigger bottom line.
It is a sadly gilded cage of a movie, all glitz and glamour on the outside, whereupon opening the cage door, we find a couple of inactive, dour parakeets. The movie's interiority is missing or has been replaced with what the studio wanted to achieve in its box office - meaning, money and the love thereof, almost guaranteeing the sacrificing of the beautiful songbirds. This COULD have been a more breath-taking Eternals' origin story had they not clipped its wings by not offering us a more panoramic view of the director's vision. Their streaming platform would have been the appropriate canvas for this artwork. I loved the all-encompassing expanses of the establishing shots, and settings, and applaud the leniency allowed to its artist to go to those locations in order to establish story authenticity. But once again, Disney doesn't want to make us uncomfortable with variations in plot structure or place us in terrain where our footing is unsure. So, we are served the same placating comedic quips and dialogue that will ensure our comfort zones are not infringed upon. They have served us with a portion of diversity that lacks divergence. The characters range in age, gender, race and sexuality, even in deafness, but without the fire and true conflict that diversity has the potential to generate. The first Marvel gay kiss lacks any passion at all. OK, so they didn't want to showcase the passion inherent in a gay relationship (the movie was even banned in the countries represented by the actor's ethnicity), nor the fact that the real spice in any sex scene, like the one on the beach, happens BELOW the belt. C'mon man, this first-time love scene for Marvel, was more akin to the dying fish left gasping for air, as the tide strands them, than the impassioned writhing of two super-powered beings! 
But this is how a commitment to the bottom line, in large corporate systems, ensures that a work of art, which is very subjective depending on its audience, will be a financial success: flatten its curves, deaden its vibrant contrasts, hence broadening its horizons. It is the Marvel formula; in order to guarantee the monetary longevity of a franchise, it tends not to confuse, offend, or challenge the Marvel fan base, which by now totals in revenues worth killing over - and kill they do.
It is the age of 'Superhero Burn-out', and the tired tropes are wearing thin. We're not going to continue to buy into the formula if this genre doesn't break out into some form of evocative theater down the road. The window dressing is all very nice, but how long do you think we are going to spend our dwindling dollars at a store with last generation consumables?
The story scale alone of the picture, spanning from 5,000 B.C., is the widest historic scale of a Marvel movie yet, and requires a strong application of storytelling coupled with terse cinema graphic juxtapositions. Then on top of that, you are supposedly fleshing out the lives of 10 characters. Oh, we get the one second, two seconds and three seconds shots alright, continuously, the former?! Not so much... They obviously, bit off more than they could chew at a mere 157-minute movie. It would have played BETTER through the elongated story arches of their six-episodic, streaming model. Given more time, at the same cost for Disney, the timeline alone should have garnered more plumage filling out the expansive beauty of the work via this platform. The studio chooses the right director though, as evidenced by her Academy Award winning work in Nomadland, but for the wrong venue, in my opinion. This was probably the executive thinking; that the shorter, more explosive (and in this case - more convoluted format), would produce greater financial returns for their $200 million investment. Then they shackled the artist with studio production standards, taking the breath out of all its exposition. One of the characteristics of all Chloé Zhao's work, is an intimate telling by the characters themselves, painting their personal realities by the way they interact with the environments they find themselves captured in, possibly held prisoner to. This is not so with these Eternals, they walk through the scenes with what appears to be a bored empathy, and a dash of subtle entitlement, as if the movie were mocking its own creation. The biggest conflict seeming to arise in their midst is whether to stay loyal to the god who created them and their mission or betray him because he lied to them about who they are - then turn to defend the ones they have fought to serve and protect all along. I think it ironic that the director finds herself in this very same predicament: true to her art or the studio? I question; if she'd not taken their offer - would the film have existed? Or the better question; would we be better off?! It is a sad indictment of the industry that every budding director wants a shot at a Marvel blockbuster, whether it fits their style of moviemaking or not. ...and therein lies the rub. Money has a way of doing that to every industry eventually - look at today's American politics. Hollywood, especially, is certainly not immune, Babylon, for starters was mockingly an appropriate choice. I bet when Feige put the handcuffs on Chloe' artistic wrists she slumped, knowing her vision would be adulterated.
All in all, Eternals is not Earth-shattering new ground for Marvel. They've created a gorgeous playground and peopled it with mannequins. Not much happening here that you haven't already experienced in a Marvel movie. On its current path, the life span of this franchise will not be an 'Eternal' one, for sure.",eternals,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,1,DC Extended Universe,0,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,DC Extended Universe,0,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1
"Criminally underrated.  And I don't quite understand why the feverous hate for this film?  Even before it was released people wanted to dislike this film.  Yes, they took a short cut to try to catch up with lucrative Marvel Cinematic Universe in creating their own DCEU.  But they're also relying on giving the general audience more credit than they probably should.  With all the movies we've seen between the two characters, there's enough history to not need our hands held or to build them up.  It's not a film meant to celebrate Batman or Superman.  It's deconstruction of both of them while at their low points, being antagonistic to one another but ultimately are forced to reconcile before the final act.  The theatrical cut was truncated into oblivion by idiots at the studio.  The Ultimate Edition fleshes things out for all parties involved in the plot much better.  Superman is seen helping paramedics save people at the capitol bombing.  Batman's motivations and Lex's plot all make more sense.  Only thing keeping this movie from being better is the sheer amount of stuff, enough for multiple individual movies smashed into one film.  Which yes, would have been the better route.  A Superman Sequel, a DK Returns Batman Movie, a World's Finest Movie, a Wonder Woman debut, Death of Superman Movie and the birth of the Justice League.  All into one.  The Doomsday fight, with Wonder Woman's triumphant entrance is quite exhilarating and bad ass.  All things considering for a rush to create their own shares superhero universe, it is done quite well.  It's an interesting artistic vision from Snyder.  All in all, about as successful as a movie as it could've been given the rush to their ultimate goal.",batman_v_superman_dawn_of_justice,DC Extended Universe,DC Extended Universe,0,0,MonsterVerse,2,DC Extended Universe,0,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1
"Kenneth Branagh reimagines Thor as a Shakespearean family drama.

Director Kenneth Branagh's superhero dramatic thriller Thor (2011) is very enthralling due to Branagh's vivid storytelling. Branagh was an interesting choice for Thor's director from producers Stan Lee and Kevin Feige, but he proves capable as he made the best Thor movie in my opinion. Branagh takes Thor's comic book story and introduces audiences with ease to complex Norse lore seriously. 

Branagh uses all his Shakespeare experience to create Thor's hubris narrative into a piercing family drama alongside the exciting action scenes with Chris Hemsworth's mighty Thor. Branagh allows for genuine dramatic moments unlike the later, lesser Thor movies, while also trying to humanize Thor's personality down to his desires for acceptance from his father, love for his lady friend, kinship from his brother, and a renewed sense of self. Kenneth Branagh is an inspired director and quite enchanting with wondrous direction for Thor.

Writers Mark Protosevich, Don Payne, J. Michael Straczynski, Ashley Edward Miller, and Zack Stentz take Thor from Norse mythology and Thor from Marvel's Comics in order to weave a parable about hubris changing into humility, friendship into love, fatherhood, and brotherly bonds. All perfect themes for any Kenneth Branagh drama film, yet here he accomplishes a gripping story with comic book action sequences on a grand scale for his god characters. Branagh's epic filmmaking with his intimate play-like dramatic staging works wonders to drive Thor's lore, personality, and inner conflicts home. I really appreciate how seriously Branagh took this job. 

Chris Hemsworth is perfectly cast as the handsome, narcissist, friendly, idiotic, brute deity Thor Odinson. Hemsworth is believable as both an arrogant fool and the mighty God of Thunder Thor. He's charming, funny, intimidating, charismatic, sincere, massive, and cool as Thor. Hemsworth's Thor is complex in his pain and endearing with his gentle romanticism, which gets you to immediately like this hero among heroes. From swinging his hammer around like he is casting thunderbolts to actually summoning lighting, Thor's action is seriously cool. I like how genuine Hemsworth plays Thor for Branagh, unlike his later outings that get more flippant and lackadaisical with the character serving as comedy relief and an action hero instead of as a real heroic character.

Natalie Portman is breathtaking as Thor's intelligent and sweet love interest Jane Foster. She's funny and charming alongside Chris Hemsworth for a cute romantic comedy feel for their scenes. Portman and Hemsworth have nice romantic chemistry. Tom Hiddleston's vicious and deceitful Loki is very fun to watch with his leering gazes of jealousy and hatred that unleash with his venomous tongue. You can feel Loki's malcontent brewing into vengeful, bitter wrath thanks to an absorbing performance from Tom Hiddleston. Sir Anthony Hopkins is phenomenal as the wise and fearsome god and Thor's careful father Odin Allfather. You certainly feel like Odin has great powers and old wisdom learned over centuries due to Hopkins' captivating, grave delivery. He does this softer nurturing voice into Hopkins' signature booming snarl so well it's like I was watching Legends of the Fall all over again.

Stellan Skarsgård is funny as Professor Erik Selvig with his smart scientific observations and rational deductions. Stellan is such a pleasant actor to watch with his natural humor and easy personality. Kat Dennings is stunningly gorgeous, quirky, and funny as the clueless intern Darcy Lewis. Clark Gregg is fun as S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Phil Coulson. Colm Feore has menace and grit as Laufey the Frost Giant King. Idris Elba's stern watcher of the rainbow bridge Heimdall is cool.

Ray Stevenson, Tadanobu Asano, and Josh Dallas are fun as Thor's warrior friends. Jaimie Alexander is so pretty and sincere as Lady Sif and really cool to see fight with her double blade. Rene Russo's Frigga has that protective motherly quality. Stan Lee's cameo is funny, but Jeremy Renner's first appearance as Hawkeye is really intriguing. You can tell his aim would be true at any moment. Samuel L. Jackson once again cameos as Nick Fury to hint at The Avengers plot line.

Editor Paul Rubell's cuts keep Thor moving briskly for a fast feeling 115 minutes of mythology and magic. I love how scenes have sharp cuts to keep you engaged, but move at a relaxed pace to let you get to know these characters at your leisure. Cinematographer Haris Zambarloukos uses neat Dutch angles and stunning perspectives to ensure Thor's Asgardian realm feels majestic in scale. His epic wide shots are as nice as his tender close-ups of faces. Production designer Bo Welch's sets bring Thor's heavenly home of Asgard to life with sleek surfaces, golden colors, and ethereal glowing. You feel like Asgard could be real with long hallways and unique ancient looking runes. 

Art directors Sean Haworth, Maya Shimoguchi, Luke Freeborn, Pierre Buffin, Kasra Farahani, A. Todd Holland, and Richard Bloom paint Thor's world of Asgard in vivid golden colors like the Frost Giant realm in icy blues and whites. Thor has creative designs and lush designs rife with detail. Thor is one of Marvel's coolest looking movies. Set decorators Lauri Gaffin, Scott Herbertson, Marco Rubeo, Kevin Loo, Tex Kadonaga, Anne Porter, Aric Cheng, C. Scott Baker, Jeff Markwith, Patte Strong-Lord, Rich Romig, and Andrew Reeder adorn Thor's world with Norse looking props and regal furnishings fit for a Norse god. I like the natural look of the scenes on Earth. 

Visual effects artists David S. Dranitzke, Nicolas Chevallier, Vincent Cirelli, Paul Butterworth, Kelly L'Estrange, Daniel P. Rosen, Diana Giorgiutti, Steve Griffith, Jonathan Harb, Kathy Siegel, Jason Bath, Wesley Sewell, Kelly Port, Pierre Escande, Nicolas Delval, Eric Petey, Cameron Neilson, Chris Antonini, Raphael A. Pimentel, and Audrey Tondre's CGI looks impressive and stylish. From Thor casting down massive thunderbolts, his glowing blue eyes, to celestial rainbow bridges opening up between dimensional realms. Thor's CGI still looks pretty neat to me. I love the practical shots of a crystal bridge for the rainbow bridge with the rainbow lights mixed in with the endless oceans and stars in the CGI background.

Composer Patrick Doyle balances his softer melodic symphonic score with grand majestic orchestration for the intense epic encounters. It's a very unique and rousing  score from Doyle that fits Branagh's shifting tones. Sound designers Tim Gomillion, Andy Nelson, Richard King, Anna Behlmer, Michael Babcock, and Ryan Cole pound your senses with magic blasts and thudding hammer blows. 

Branagh's Thor costumes are wicked with a warm color palette and lore detail in the armor that Marvel had not yet achieved before. Costume designers Alexandra Byrne, James W. Tyson, Dawn Y. Line, Anthony Almaraz, Angelique Paull, David Fernandez, Bob Moore Jr, Valentina Aulisi, Sean Haley, Jesse Trevino, Yvonne Bastidos, Myron Baker, Elizabeth Lancaster, Edward T. Hanley, Michael Welch, Joy Ramsay, Mara Herdmann, Paula Trujillo, Mark J. Weitzman, Bradford Booth, and Allison Fusaro came up with striking godly armor designs that harken back to both Norse mythology with the old patterns and rune symbols as well as Thor's Marvel Comics. All of Luisa Abel and Edouard F. Henriques' hair and make-up looks amazing with flowing locks of hair for both gentlemen and ladies' tresses in Thor. Everyone just beams with a radiant look with their make-up.

Overall, Kenneth Branagh's Thor is a top tier Marvel movie and remains my favorite of Thor's movies thus far.",thor,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,1,MonsterVerse,2,MonsterVerse,2,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1
"'Godzilla' is one very expensive looking movie. The VFX and all around production value of this film are to be admired. Not once did anything look fake or animated, but that was probably the only perfect thing about the movie.

"Sorry to the defenders of this film, but it is indefensible. It's a movie rushed out of the gate, with a boring story and little development.

She was only introduced to the MCU because they needed a super-powered hero like Superman for DC, mostly because Vision died, and because they needed someone who could take a couple of good hits on Thanos (because it was nothing more than just that) and someone who could destroy the ship.",captain_marvel,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1
"Having been underwhelmed by the waste of great potential that was 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' (not terrible but rather lacklustre) and seeing that critical reception was not particularly good, expectations for 'Justice League' were not very high.

Although it has major problems, 'Justice League' turned out to be better than expected. Contrary to the constant critic bashing, which to be perfectly honest has gotten out of control and extremely annoying fast for a while now, critics get a good deal of respect from me. Even when my opinions differ to theirs, which has happened a fair number of times, their appraisals and criticisms are very understandable and it is easy to see where they are coming from. 'Justice League' is a case of the film being much better than anticipated, considering the word of mouth and 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' being so disappointing. Is 'Justice League' better than that film? Yes, by quite a bit.

'Justice League' does have its problems. Although the CGI is pretty good on the whole, there is an over-reliance of it and it doesn't always add to some of the scenes. The story has its fun and excitingly compelling moments, but a lot of it does feel rushed, which does see too many abrupt tonal and storytelling shifts, and some of the first half has a cobbled together and rambling quality. Am usually not one to carp about plot holes, much of the time it is a lazy criticism to me, but one can fit the Grand Canyon through some of them and some border on the ridiculous.

The rushed pacing does come at the expense of character development, which tends to be rather flimsy. Particularly true to this is the villain, there is nothing menacing or remotely interesting about him, he's basically a very dull just there sort of character. Ciaran Hinds is completely wasted, while Ray Fisher is somewhat dull. Not all the jokes work, some feel out of place, while the final battle could have had more excitement and Danny Elfman's music score is uninspired and forgettable.

On the other hand, most of the acting is very good. Ben Affleck brings a brooding intensity to Batman and he didn't seem that bored to me. Other bright spots in the cast are Jeremy Irons' very amusing Alfred, Amy Adams' feisty if somewhat underused Lois Lane, Jason Momoa's beautifully judged Aquaman and particularly Gal Gadot's positively show-stopping Wonder Woman. Ezra Miller is amusing, if at times slightly too introverted, as Flash and Henry Cavill looks much more comfortable here than he did in 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice'. Diane Lane and JK Simmons are also welcome presences.

Visually, 'Justice League' is beautifully shot, far more cohesively edited and its boldly dark and gritty look fits very well within the story. The script is less clunky and dreary and lightened by some nice quirky humour and some jokes are amusing, especially the absolute hoot that involves the magic lasso. The action is mostly nicely choreographed and fun to watch, some of the characters are interesting and the chemistry is great.

In summary, could have been much better but to me it wasn't that bad. 5.5-6/10 Bethany Cox",justice_league_2017,DC Extended Universe,DC Extended Universe,0,0,Star Wars,3,DC Extended Universe,0,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,DC Extended Universe,0

It's also refreshing to have veteran actors Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer play the original Ant-Man and the Wasp. Michael Peña and Randall Park offered great comedic support. Special effects were amazing and almost flawless. The main villain was badass, yet redeemable.

None of which needed to be re-shot, or added any value.  Including the hideous digitized blurred mustache on Cavill's face.  Affleck is visibly checked out for all the re-shoots.  Bloated, red faced from alcohol consumption.  My favorite character of Batman is turned into a literal punchline here.

"'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' was not as awful as reputed, but was a huge disappointment. With the cast it had and the characters it was going to have in it it had the potential. It is such a shame that, despite some bright spots, Zach Snyder badly bungles its execution.

The best things about 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' are the final battle and Ben Affleck. The final battle, which takes up much of the final 40 minutes, is explosively thrilling, dynamically choreographed, passionately performed and beautifully shot. That's true of all of the action actually. Am usually not a big fan of Affleck, but he does do a surprisingly great job as Batman. The casting could have been disastrous but Affleck gives a brooding intensity to the character and more range than he usually exudes. Other bright spots in the cast are Jeremy Irons' very amusing Alfred, Amy Adams' feisty if somewhat underused Lois Lane and particularly Gal Gadot's positively show-stopping Wonder Woman.

Visually, 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' mostly looks good, with the sole exceptions of some very jumpy editing and the rather artificial-looking Doomsday. It's beautifully shot however and boldly dark and gritty look fits beautifully within the story. Hans Zimmer's music score has many moments of sheer power and beauty, one of his more dynamic and involving scores in recent years.

These great things are unfortunately outweighed by the bad. The weakest asset of 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' is the story, which only really comes to life in the last forty minutes. In the meantime it takes seemingly forever to get there with a particularly ham-fisted, rambling and dull first hour. Another big problem with the story is that it's overstuffed, from trying to insert so many ideas, subplots and characters, and too often under-cooked dramatically, from too many of the characters being given short shrift and from too many of the subplots being underdeveloped, discarded or at the end of the day unnecessary. Half an hour's trimming at least would have made it far better already.

Snyder is great in visual style and in the action, but in the drama, which is a mess of overwrought and undercooked, and storytelling he does flounder badly here. The script is at best clunky and dreary, with few moments that evoke thought, very few moments resonate emotionally and the funnier quirkier scenes apart from with Irons seem misplaced. Pacing is all over the place, with some parts feeling jumpy and then most parts in serious begging of a steroid shot. While there are some bright spots in the cast, too many of the performances don't come off well. Jesse Eisenberg is the biggest problem, his manic and almost comical Lex Luthor belongs in another film entirely, while Henry Cavill is stiff and ill at ease this time round as Superman complete with limited expression. Laurence Fishburne tries his best and has moments but he doesn't blend as well as he could have done. And to say that the film makes a complete waste of Doomsday, who was non-threatening and pretty pointless actually, is an insult to the word wasted.

In conclusion, the potential was high but despite some bright spots 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' misses the mark. 4/10 Bethany Cox",batman_v_superman_dawn_of_justice,DC Extended Universe,DC Extended Universe,0,0,DC Extended Universe,0,DC Extended Universe,0,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,DC Extended Universe,0,DC Extended Universe,0

The character work for Rocket ​Racoon and Yondu is the closest the MCU has brought me to tears and some of the best emotional scenes in any comic book movie.

Quill remains charming as ever and has a pretty good arc of learning to abandon his toxic traits and entitlement to be a better leader for the team.
The scene with Drax and Mantis is visual storytelling done right and I wish we had more of this in this franchise.

"This movie is great but it requires a lot of work from the audience. You have to be aware of your greek mythology to understand much of it, it's really deeply woven with intricate details and informations that the more I rewatch, the more I discover. Some parts of the story did not make sense to me probably because they had too many characters to focus on.

"Captain America The Winter Soldier was one of my favorite movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, because it gets so many things right. It is the kind of movie that can be watched by nearly anyone, and the plot is coherent enough to follow along and enjoy. Out of my favorite action and fight scenes in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, a handful of this are in this movie, and on top of that they are paced well enough apart that the movie doesn't feel too packed or stretched thin in any way. Captain America The Winter Soldier is one of the few solo Marvel Cinematic Universe movies to have an impact on future films in the franchise, and due to the importance of it and just how good the movie is overall I highly recommend going back and rewatching.",captain_america_the_winter_soldier_2014,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1
"Kong Skull Island, despite the fact that it breaks the closed intro and ending set in the first installment of 2014, with possible and doubtful blunders, manages to be somewhat entertaining due to its humor and its special effects, despite the fact that some humans do not contribute much to the plot and that they are only there as a filler. Kong has incredible moments, despite the fact that it does not have too much emotion like the excellent 2005 remake, but even so, you become interested once again in its past, together with the fact that it tells us a new story after 12 years.",kong_skull_island,MonsterVerse,MonsterVerse,2,2,MonsterVerse,2,MonsterVerse,2,Star Wars,3,MonsterVerse,2,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1

While it does have some faults though, it does a lot of things right that make it fun to watch at times, before it slams on the breaks and becomes an annoying or boring movie for scenes, and then back to being a fun paced film again. The movie could be improved with just a couple more months of editing and the removal of some elements that slow the pace of the movie down such as the kid, and some reworking of the Mandarin villain would have been nice.

Dando una sensación mas realista con la película; Cosa que no sucedía con la primera parte. Algo que me gustó de la película fue la sub trama que le dan al la discriminación en el mundo mágico. Tomándose mas enserio la película y la trama; Dando pie a un muy buen diálogo y algunas escenas memorables que no necesariamente tienen que contener magia.

Even the villian cares more about Iron Man than Spidey, like c'mon. The love interest is quite useless and theres absolutely no chemistry. This movie almost would have worked without one.

"When Stephen Strange, a highly skilled neurosurgeon, gets into a life-altering car wreck, his livelihood is threatened by the possibility of no longer being able to use his hands. Having to humble himself and allow his mind to be challenged, Strange seeks out the use of mystical arts to nurse him back to good health. After having mastered the arts, he comes across several cataclysmic secrets and ruthless villains that dwell in multiple dimensions.

Some may say that the feature relied too heavily on CGI, but those people have unquestionably never seen a Marvel film before. That being said, the action scenes, action violence, and sci-fi visual effects were outstanding. 

Alongside a few other brilliant dramatic actors, Cumberbatch is great as Strange. He exudes arrogance, brilliance, hopelessness, and heroism flawlessly through his literary and literally multi-dimensional character.

The script follows a strategic formula established by the geniuses from Marvel, but has enough twists and turns to leave viewers on the edge of their seats.

"This movie is just an abomination. It is impossible to fit Newts cute animal storys into a bigger plotline about a wizarding world war. None of the characters except for Tina should be in this movie. They do not belong in this setting. Newt is not a capable wizard. He is a fucking zookeeper. Why should he have to chose a side in this conflict when he could not have an impact on the story if JK did not magically give him one. The worst thing about this movie, however, is the absolute disgrace of trying to be a continuation of the first movie. This movie completly retcons the ending of the first movie in the first 20 minutes. 
They should have just made one movie about Newt and his pets in america and a possible movie series about dumbledore and Grindelwald. They could have maybe even made a connection between them by making Newts brother the point of view character in this series. Seeing that he is a capable auror who has already proven himself in war he definetly fits the part.

Knightmare is what Batman has dream's about and fear's one day will come true, he then form's the Justice League instantly spawning the 2017 Justice League.

"Is 'Guardians of the Galaxy' as amazing as the IMDb rating (which this reviewer learned long ago is not something that should be taken to heart) and ecstatic reviews suggest? To me, not quite. Is 'Guardians of the Galaxy' well made and entertaining? Absolutely.

'Guardians of the Galaxy' boasts spectacular special effects, gorgeously psychedelic colours, slick-yet-with-enough-visual-depth cinematography (nothing cartoonish or plastic here) and very colourful and atmospheric sets that more than effectively makes one think they are immersed in this galaxy. Costumes and make-up are also of very good quality. The 70s soundtrack and score is rousing and touchingly nostalgic. The action is beautifully edited, choreographed with lots of entertainment value and thrills and is at best exhilarating, there's plenty of it without feeling too much.

James Gunn directs with style and a sure hand, always seeming as if he knew what tone he was going for and who he was aiming at ('Guardians of the Galaxy' is far and above anything else he's done and his best overall direction is here as well. Personally really enjoyed the way that 'Guardians of the Galaxy' was written too, the jokes are enormously entertaining and the film also has heart with a genuinely emotional opening.

The story is non-stop energy and compelling, with a nice balance of comedy, drama and section. It is not perfect, and is one of the film's weaker points, with a been-there-done-that feel, a couple of overly-sentimental moments and a couple of randomly placed moments that were not needed at all and just took away from the flow and tone of the scene (Chris Pratt's dance).

The characters are on the most part incredibly colourful and engaging, with a great chemistry throughout. Peter is a likable lead character and Groot is quite adorable and amusing, but Rocket the Racoon doesn't just threaten to steal the show, to me Rocket actually does steal the show. The one exception really is the very bland and barely developed villain Ronan.

Chris Pratt is highly charismatic, Zoe Saldana is suitably fiery, Karen Gillan is imposingly formidable, Dave Bautista induces lots of laughs and charm while showing a very intensely played vengeful side (though that was a little too hastily introduced) and a surprisingly well-cast Vin Diesel does a great job as Groot. Bradley Cooper stands out, being a sheer delight as Rocky. Lee Pace tries but struggles to bring any menace or dimension to Ronan, can't say I blame him as anybody given the role if written in the way it was here would have struggled to bring believability to it.

All in all, not perfect and not quite as great as all that but exciting, well-made and lots of fun, really enjoyed it. 8/10 Bethany Cox",guardians_of_the_galaxy,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1

"Spider-Man's No Way Home is a messy multiverse web to untangle, with manifold logic and plot problems. If the three Peter Parkers ended the race to the films end at a break-neck pace straight to Pay Off City, they began it by literally stumbling in a heap and breaking their necks. It is a feast of fan service you needn't feel guilty getting fat on: fanservice which exists in service of the plot, instead of being nothing more than a naked nostalgia cash grab. It is a fucking fantastic film, a Marvel movie bolstered by an ensemble cast of almost universally perfect performances; a pathotic character study/ hero's journey that truly nails the comic book hero's central premise (famously phrased as, ""With Great Power, Comes Great Responsibility) better than any prior motion picture. I promise, its final moments WILL hit you in the feels. Objectively, No Way Home may not be the best constructed Spider-Man, but is obviously the best in its trilogy.

The look into a magical government was also nice. The ""Fantastic Beasts"" part of the film was great. The other part, dealing with society and politics, was quite disappointing.

"I love the unique tone of this new entry into the MCU which leans way into the lighthearted humor, yet never sacrifices any of the wider ranging stakes or suspenseful action sequences we usually find in the Marvel films. While I laughed more during this than any film so far on this rewatch, I also loved the beautiful, and sometimes even touching, exploration of loss and friendship taking place just under the surface.

The soundtrack is also easily my favorite so far of any MCU film and helps create that unique tone I find so pleasing that I touched on above. I hadn't seen this for over six years and remembered the opening sequence featuring adult Star Lord quite well, likely because of the accompanying music.

The cast has such fun chemistry and emits a pleasing magnetism, easily drawing me in and heightening my interest in each of their diverse back stories. Dave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer earns the MVP on this watch, eliciting quite a few audible giggles and even an outright laugh or two. John C. Reilly was also a pleasant surprise and got laughs in a couple of his very few appearances.

I'll always appreciate the superhero movies with some humor and a lighter, more playful tone, over the ultra serious, more classically inspired, style. Iron Man and Thor gave a taste of the slightly irreverent humor that the Guardians successfully ratchet, or Rocket, up to another level. 7.5/10",guardians_of_the_galaxy,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,1,MonsterVerse,2,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Star Wars,3,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1

There is a lot of story to tell in Civil War, and while a lot of it is done right, it still feels like this is two movies packed into one.

"A surprisingly decent Harry Potter prequel that stands on its own as a fun little adventure with magical creatures and charming 1920s Americana aesthetics. The movie does a good job with worldbuilding, showing us how the wizarding world operates in other countries and time periods. The creature designs are very creative and I love the way they're treated more like animals that can be reasoned with rather than mindless monsters that need to be slain. Eddie Redmayne is adorkable as the main lead, albeit a bit emotionally distant at times. But his passion for the titular beasts and his chemistry with the rest of the cast are a joy to watch. I didn't care much for his detective companion, but her quirky sister and the well-meaning but bumbling muggle friend were so endearing to watch. Granted the story can get convoluted and contrived at times (like why were they going to be so casually executed by the Wizarding estate just for their minor violations? I wouldn't mind so much if the main detective character didn't wind up working for them on good terms by the end of the story after such a horrific incident.). So I wouldn't say it's a great successor to the Harry Potter saga, but this first installment was still a fun easy ride nonetheless.",fantastic_beasts_and_where_to_find_them,Wizarding World,Marvel Cinematic Universe,4,1,MonsterVerse,2,Wizarding World,4,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Wizarding World,4

- The end fight is really short
- The end fight is Iron Man fighting someone with the same powers as him

"The Age of Ultron, (which has to tell the truth I think I did not even reach the week). It is a very good film to my taste, its story is very well done and structured, and it is justified. The characters are very good, both the Avengers and the new ones, like Wanda, Pietro and Vision. While villains like Ultron I think they are very good but they could have given a little more.
The music is very good, as always when it comes to the Avengers, the visual effects are incredible, they are one of the few Marvel productions that still have good visual effects.
In conclusion, I would say that the criticism that has been given to this film is valid, but it is true that before giving your own opinion you must see it and not let yourself be carried away by that of other people.

One thing I always admire about the Harry Potter movies is how they not only focus on the main plot, but also have time to show other, world building things. I feel like they perfected that in this movie, unlike in the first movie which was waayyy too much world building and not enough plot.
As always, the twist at the end is top notch.
I love the setup and implications for the future - like they say in the movie, everything will be different from now on!",harry_potter_and_the_goblet_of_fire,Wizarding World,Marvel Cinematic Universe,4,1,Star Wars,3,Wizarding World,4,MonsterVerse,2,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Wizarding World,4
"Avengers: Infinity War tells the story of the combat of several heroes against an enemy, much bigger than them.

The movie is, quite simply, a 21st century masterpiece, probably the best hero movie after its sequel. The biggest highlight is its script, which managed to bring together several characters and built a VERY intriguing story, and its visual and general direction, which is impeccable. Not only that, but the adventure and action are perfect, especially with the good acting. Another extremely positive point is that, even though the film is long, there is not a moment when you disconnect, as the jokes are balanced, the dialogues are not tiring and the story is captivating. The film is an explosion of emotions, especially for fans.

Honestly, I dont see any major downsides in the film. Everything fits perfectly. Not only that, but its a movie that manages to stand on its own, although its always better to watch the previous movies for a better experience.",avengers_infinity_war,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Star Wars,3,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Star Wars,3
"Among the most overrated films to come out of the MCU.  It fits more along the lines of just ok.  The story lacked umph, the villian was more annoying than interesting (his problem was daddy issues?), and the final fight scene was spectacularly underwhelming.  As a MCU fan, it is worth watching to see how Black Panther integrates with the rest of the overarching storyline, but that's about it.",black_panther_2018,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Wizarding World,1,4,DC Extended Universe,0,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,MonsterVerse,2,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,MonsterVerse,2
"I found it very difficult to separate this viewing experience from reading the source material -- they had so much plot to condense that it ends up being nearly all that we're left with. There's a distinct lack of joy de vivre as it's a rather solemn, darkly-toned book and they minimized parts in the movie that were bright points in the novel, like excising Quidditch and spending very little time at Grimmauld place. The composer basically just being some guy the director knew was a shockingly poor decision as he was clearly unprepared for so important a movie, producing the worst film score in the entire franchise. The acting from Imelda and Bonham Carter was very impressive but particularly with the former it wasn't so magnificent that it had me enjoying scenes with her character in them; my nostalgia for this series is rooted in the very first movie where there's a thick air of whimsy and wonder, and thus I generally dislike most of the deviations from that atmosphere, with Umbridge being the prime example. The third act of this is still a sight to behold and the whole thing is thoroughly enjoyable to watch, but for me this rates among the bottom of the franchise in terms of entertainment value.",harry_potter_and_the_order_of_the_phoenix,Wizarding World,Wizarding World,4,4,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,DC Extended Universe,0,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,DC Extended Universe,0,Wizarding World,4
"One of my favourite MCU movies was so awesome to see all the hero’s at the time come together even tho some don’t even like each other but come together for the greater good.

"Godzilla: King of the Monsters was spectacular. Jaw-dropping visuals and special effects. It has multiple giant creatures fighting against each other and the humans. It's an amazing spectacle of sights and sounds -- enormous creatures and thunderous sound effects you can feel. Creature design was great too. It didn't really bother me that the human character development and interactions were minimal, because the main characters were played by very good actors. I liked how they included Millie Bobby Brown, because she's a very promising actress oozing with charisma. If you like lots of giant monster action, you will greatly enjoy this movie.

"Tom Holland's sophomore appearance as Spider-Man certainly does not disappoint. Holland not only shows he can play an entertaining Spider-Man, but he also shows he understands the importance of playing a good Peter Parker as well. In this film, we see Peter try and take the roll left to him by Tony Stark (The MCU's Ben Parker to him). We see Peter continually doubt his abilities both as a superhero and a teenage boy. The amount of growth by Peter in this movie continues to show that Spider-Man is the most relatable superhero we've seen. What really shines in this movie is Peter and MJ's relationship progression. Holland and Zendaya have amazing chemistry no doubt due to their real-life relationship. Both play characters that made me say ""Yep, this is how awkward teenagers act"" throughout the movie. Gyllenhall's Mysterio is fun, but I would have loved to have seen him play a hero because I feel he exudes the charisma of a superhero. The mid-credit scene is a real treat for those OG Spider-Man fans with the return of J.J. Jameson. 

The low points of this movie are the CGI and casting of May Parker. The CGI can be great in some areas and very poor in others. Also, I kind of understand why Marvel decided to cast someone young to play May, but it's still weird. May has always been this fragile woman who has guided Peter's desire to protect the weak. But in this version, she is hooking up with Happy, so it feels a bit out of character compared to previous versions of May. I do like that Peter's identity was revealed to her after the first movie. Something about that just makes it feel like he has a partner to help him. Overall, fantastic movie. I will definitely watch this one again.",spider_man_far_from_home,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,1,MonsterVerse,2,MonsterVerse,2,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,DC Extended Universe,0
"Nothing new, startling or punch-y. So by-the-numbers, the plot reminded me of those bad 1980s superhero movies, but with a bigger budget. The reveal was telegraphed, so anyone surprised by the twist wasn't paying attention, I guess. 

There was also a smugness by the main character I found to be sort of strange for a character that supposedly was trying to solve a mystery, like she already knew the ending of her own story and belittled anyone not keeping up.",captain_marvel,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Star Wars,1,3,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Wizarding World,4,Wizarding World,4,DC Extended Universe,0,MonsterVerse,2

"Just barely shaving off any greatness from its predecessors, Return is probably the most fun Star Wars movie out there. It's got so many visually memorable moments. That being said, it gets bogged down by a couple goofy moments and loses some steam in the middle because of it. Despite this, it more than makes up for it by the end, with some great, emotionally heavy moments later on. I loved this movie so much as a kid and I still do; it's obvious Lucas was going for my age group with this movie, but it made me a fan nonetheless.

"Zach Snyder. I hope your are reading this. YOU ARE A GREAT FILMMAKER. Ok. Nothing will take that away from you.

BUT, like asking Gordon Ramsey to make Sushi, you need to follow your strengths.

If you MUST do DC comics based movies, I recommend the following IP that better suit you.
Monarch: a the tyrant and last super hero on a future earth. The JLA must discover which one amongst them will become Monarch before the time of Monarch's rising.
Etrigan: a knight who failed Camelot and cursed by Merlin to live forever bonded to a demon.
Orion: The son of Darkseid and the Adopted son of High Father. The son of Space Satan and the adopted son of Space Jahovah.
The Authority/The Elite: A super hero team takes over the world without mercy, pity, or borders. 

Play into your strengths. You want to make these large odyssies of despair and bitter heroism? I am glad your films have fans, but working with Superman and the JLA.............. it is like my favorite pizza place turned into an icecream shop and has no pizza anymore. ITS GOOD, but the reason I came is gone.

And if you could choose between nerd properties from other companies, I recommend the following.

Spawn, Ghost Rider, Punisher, Conan the Barbarian, Mech Warrior,  Warhammer 40k, Rom Space knight, Fist of the North Star, Berserk, Death Note, Madoka Magica (Yeah, I can't believe that either, but trust me, that would be right up your alley), God of War, Mortal Kombat, or Neon Genisis Evangelion.

The movie was way to hyped when it came out. The villian is sucks. The main charecter was so much better in civil war. The first half of the movie is boring. Stuff like trial by combate and letting your king risk his life by fighting other people from your fellow tribes then also fighting whomever the black panthers target is is kinda dumb but whatever. Then in the final battle tachala? fights the killmonger? in a terrible cgi fight where they can't damage each other unless this train passes by every once in a while. Then the MC stabs the bady in the heart and being stabbed in the heart the they have a fun on conversation. The MC then SLOWLY brings the bad guy from underground to some entrence on a hill.

"Chamber of Secrets is an improvement compared to the first film. The movies' best qualities are warmth between characters and the many action sequences. This film benefits from not having as much seemingly useless dialogue as its predecessor. It helps that the main actors have learned a thing or two since the first film about leading an audience along in a story - the acting is much better here (cannot say the same about Harry's rival, who still comes across as cheesy and a cry baby). I appreciated the fact the film had high stakes and set design reminiscent of Lord of the Rings and other fantasy films of the era. The biggest problem with this film is its length (almost 3 hours long for what's basically a kids movie) & how some of the darker elements make me feel uneasy.",harry_potter_and_the_chamber_of_secrets,Wizarding World,Wizarding World,4,4,DC Extended Universe,0,DC Extended Universe,0,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Wizarding World,4

This movie was (from what I understood of it) just some random story about Grindelwald living in the Wizarding World, while having enemies.

"Captain America the First Avenger is a fun film to watch, but there is still a looming feeling of pointlessness behind it. The film seems to rush through some plot points as if knowing that it has to introduce Steve Rogers, give him the serum, introduce the tesseract, and then freeze Steve so he can wake up in modern day New York City for The Avengers movie. The times watching the Howling Commandos, Steve, and the rest of the characters interact are some of the most fun, and its sad to know we won't see them again in the future. There are a lot of fun scenes throughout the film, and some scenes that could be cut or trimmed down. The second viewing of this movie I definetly appreciated it a lot more than the first time I watched it, and it makes me want to see more from the side characters featured in it. If doing an overall rewatch of the Marvel Cinematic Universe this is one that can probably be skipped, but I do suggest checking it out for a good sci-fi action world war II comic book movie.",captain_america_the_first_avenger,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1
"I was never a big superhero fan and have only seen most of the Marvel films once but this was still the only MCU movie I had yet to see. Despite the Hulk being my favorite Avenger, I had always heard the negatives and assumed these movies must have been real bad since there were never anymore films featuring this character.

It was a dull story but introduced some origin elements and characters previously unfamiliar to me. I am not sure if this was harder for me to get into since there was no real link to the greater MCU until the very end (at least evident to a casual fan). It also felt more like a stand alone movie knowing Edward Norton would not be playing the Hulk in later appearances.

As has always been the case for me with Marvel, assuming because I was never a big fan, the ""great"" MCU movies were never as good as the hype and the ""awful"" movies never ended up being as bad for me.",the_incredible_hulk,Marvel Cinematic Universe,MonsterVerse,1,2,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,DC Extended Universe,0,DC Extended Universe,0,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,DC Extended Universe,0
"Guardians of the Galaxy is not the perfect movie, but it is very close. Minus the lack of the villain's presence throughout the film except for the end battle, and a plot that is a little weak in areas, the movie has everything else to be desired. The cast is perfect, the characters are fun and entertaining, the worlds they explore are jaw dropping at times, and come to life at every step. Then there is the best part of the movie, the soundtrack which brings a great collection of songs from the 70's and late 60's. There is little to complain about and a lot to like about Guardians of the Galaxy, and even after watching it for what I can only assume is my 20th time by now, it still holds up. While it has little to do with the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe I highly recommend going back and watching it again.

"The first and third act are some of the best in the MCU, for both character and action.
The second act isn't bad, but that airport fight leaves a bad taste. It feels forced, presents itself like some grand showdown when it really isn't and the characters make jokes with each other in between. Am I really supposed to feel worried for anyone when this conflict is supposedly meant  to shatter the team dynamic?
Also I do not like Zemo, his plan is to get rid of the people responsible for protecting the Earth from existential threats that have showed up at least twice already? I guess I understand his motivations but again, it feels forced.
The character work for Steve and Tony is great in this, I never doubted that they would make the decisions that they make. But a lot of the supporting cast do not have compelling reasons to be in this fight.

"Muy buena película, una cinta de superhéroes demasiado infravalorada en mi opinión. Lamentablemente esta película no tuvo las criticas esperadas, pero para mi es muy buena, llena de emoción, suspenso y la acción impactante. Esta película se inclina mas hacia una trama con acción y con un ritmo mas frenético, dejando de lado como se desarrollo la historia del personaje en la cinta del 2003. En cuanto al cast, para mi es perfecto, Edward Norton encaja perfectamente en el papel de Bruce Banner, sin duda alguna mejor que las otras versiones de Hulk y por lejos el mejor actor. El diseño de Hulk también me gusta mucho, a pesar de que en algunas escenas el CGI no esta tan bien hecho. A pesar de esto, creo que es el Hulk perfecto que se pudo ver en acción, super intimidante, fuerte y sin hacerse el cómico por momentos. En cuanto al villano final, no me termino de convencer principalmente su diseño, el cual me parece que no le queda nada bien y tampoco me gusta que este hablando en sus escenas. Por otro lado, además de Edward Norton, en las actuaciones también se destacan Liv Tyler, William Hurt y Tim Roth.

"Having seen the first movie in what Warner Bros is calling their Monsterverse Film series, I had to admit I wasn't very interested. Godzilla was good but I didn't think it should have spawned a series. When I heard of this movie, I didn't know what to think but with a cast of splendid actors from John Goodman, Samuel L. Jackson, Brie Larson, Tom Hiddleston, and so many others, I couldn't help myself, so I decided to check this movie out.

Set years before the events of Godzilla, the film starts in the 1940s for a spell before moving into its more prominent time frame in 1973. Monarch, an organization investigating the search for Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms believes it has found a lead into an island that is the origin point for said MUTOs. Leading scientists obtain permission from the US Government to look into the island. What follows is an incredible adventure involving scientists, soldiers, and many others in a race to save themselves from such ferocious monsters. 

What makes this great is that not all monsters are bad, as long as mankind understands the rules one can become their savior, in this case, it's Kong, the gigantic ape that stops the more savage Skull Crawlers that are indiscriminate against the humans that arrive at Skull Island.

I got to say this was a phenomenal movie from the actors, the special effects to the action sequences. The story is better than Godzilla or maybe I just love my big American Ape than that giant Japanese lizard. It is a stark change from how King Kong has been depicted from the original 1930s movie with only the island and the titular character. I have heard it often the idea of pitting the great monsters Kong vs Godzilla as a fan service before and it would appear that this is the direction that it is headed for the MonsterVerse.

"This film was so highly anticipated that it seems like the creators felt like failure was impossible, and so over hyped after-the-fact that nobody wants to point out the obvious flaws.
Now, if I decided to delve into every issue I had with the film, we'd be here all day, so I'll focus on my biggest gripes. These two things are crucial to get right if you want to make a quality film, especially a superhero film and ESPECIALLY one this ambitious. You can't sacrifice the basics.
The script, and the villain.
The script was cringe worthy from the very beginning. You could tell the actors were doing their best with what they were given, but unfortunately their efforts couldn't salvage it. Many lines and scenes felt superfluous and doused in gravitas without any substance to speak of, leaving me wondering if I was missing something. It seems like it would be difficult to make your characters sound like they're being over dramatic when the stakes are half the lives in the universe, but somehow this script succeeds.
However, my absolute biggest gripe of the film was the flimsy, unsympathetic, one-dimensional and frustratingly melodramatic villain, Thanos. Now, I know for a fact that Marvel knows how to write a quality villain. You've got sympathetic characters that, under certain circumstances, you may actually find yourself rooting for like Helmut Zemo, Eric Killmonger, Ava Starr and (more recently) Black Widow's adaptation of Taskmaster. There are charismatic, campy villains that sacrifice relatability for entertainment value like Hela, Mysterio and (more recently) Agatha Harkness. There are tragic villains that compellingly surrendered to the lemons life gave them like Loki and (more recently) Wenwu. Even most of Marvel's villains who are just straight-up psychopaths have a fleshed-out motivation, like a lust for power or money (Ulysses Klau), revenge (Aldrich Killian, Ivan Vanko), or zealotry (Ronan, Kaecilius) to support and strengthen their character
Thanos has exactly none of those things. Maybe he'd be sympathetic if we knew more about him, but we don't. He's not charismatic, tragic or relatable. As a matter of fact, he has no clear motivation for his actions whatsoever, making the melodrama of his speech pattern unearned, incredibly grating and frankly hard to watch. I have no idea what gets him out of bed in the morning or what happened in his life to get him to this point. Maybe he's more fleshed out in the comic books, but if your movie has required reading in order to enjoy it, I'm sorry, you're doing something wrong.
This conundrum is further emphasized by the fact that his end goal doesn't make sense, and there are about a million alternative solutions available to the wielder of the infinity gauntlet to the problem of overpopulation that don't include genociding half of all life, yet he seems stuck on it for absolutely no reason.
A good superhero movie is made or broken by the quality of the villain, and the whiny, superficial antagonist here was incredibly immersion-breaking. I didn't believe him. To me, he felt like nothing more than an overpowered, psychopathic, petulant child.
Overall, I have to say, I expected a lot more from Marvel. The plot felt rushed and the interactions of the characters that don't typically interact felt clunky, lazily written, and at times felt like entirely different characters than the ones I've come to love.
I genuinely don't understand how so many people claim to love this film so much. It was, simply, terrible.",avengers_infinity_war,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,1,Star Wars,3,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,MonsterVerse,2
"100% underrated film.True, it's far from being one of the best in the MCU, but let's face it, this movie is the one that has treated the Hulk character the best.  Maybe in the part of Bruce Banner I do prefer Mark Ruffalo a bit, but this Hulk is superior to the soft green monster with baby complexes. And he's a thousand times superior to Professor Hulk from Endgame, really, in the movies it's better to have them separated.Here we are shown a Hulk to be afraid of (which is in itself the intention of a green monster as a hero), most of all in that final battle against Abomination and in every battle sequence against Ross and his army. This Hulk would have given Thanos a great fight and not freaked out in Infinity War just to give Bruce more of the spotlight.",the_incredible_hulk,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Wizarding World,4,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,MonsterVerse,2
"Taiki does well to introduce a much needed fresh dose of humour to the MCU.
It never felt too much for me, while also giving us some of Thors best action sequences.
Thor is re-invented, not that I think he needed to since I appreciated the Shakespearian inspired version of the character, but I do think the change works for the franchise moving forward. Hemsworth is still great in the role.
Loki has less to do than in the previous movies and has somewhat of an arc, but he lacks any standout moments like in the past films.
Hela works for the film as an unredeemable menace to our heroes. Maybe the only live action female villain that Disney didn't feel the need to try and make sympathetic and I can appreciate that. Also Cate Blanchett is stunning in goth.
The Hulk is fun in this but Banner feels underused. I think Whedon was the only filmmaker who really cared about Bruce and it shows.
Love the Goldblumisms shining through the grandmaster.
The Synthe inspired music is great too.",thor_ragnarok_2017,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,MonsterVerse,2,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,DC Extended Universe,0
"Wonder Woman è senza dubbio il miglior prodotto della DC, in quasi tutti i suoi aspetti.
La trama è piena di avvenimenti, con un ottimo preambolo e uno svolgimento pieno e complesso; che lascia molto spazio a differenti location e a diverse sequenze di azione molto diverse tra di loro in ogni aspetto.
Purtroppo in alcuni passaggi è troppo marchiano l'utilizzo degli effetti grafici computerizzati, che rendono artificiosi alcuni passaggi.
La storia tra Gal Gadot e Chris Pine riescono a conquistare come coppia perfetta.
Meno interessanti alcuni personaggi di contorno piuttosto stilizzati.",wonder_woman_2017,DC Extended Universe,DC Extended Universe,0,0,DC Extended Universe,0,DC Extended Universe,0,MonsterVerse,2,DC Extended Universe,0,MonsterVerse,2
"(A SPIDER-MAN MOVIE THAT SURPRISED ME)
This new Spider-Man movie really impressed me, and it was a lot better than I thought it was going too be. Michael Keaton does an amazing job as a super villain and he really shows everyone that he can play both a superhero and a villain in the superhero movies. I haven't seen too many Marvel movies lately, but this one is definetely a great one. Lots of amazing action scenes that look very realistic and all of the cast members do an amazing job with their acting. Tom Holland is a better Spider-Man than Andrew Garfield, I can say that for certain. It's a different take on Spider-Man but in a positive and fun way. True superhero fans will appreciate this movie and see that it's a great film in general.",spider_man_homecoming,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Star Wars,3,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1

"Overall the movie is not quite as bad as I remember it being, but it is still one of the weaker entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. With some pacing issues, and some inconsistencies there are plenty of parts of the movie that could be reworked. The acting is great though, and the action scenes do feel like they have some punch. While it is hard to hold it against this film, the hulk seems very slim compared to what we will come to see in future Marvel movies, so seeing this slimmer hulk was a bit odd, but nothing I could count against the movie as a whole as it works here. There isn't really anything that comes out of this movie except for Ross and Banner (who was recast following this film) so skipping it for End Game probably won't leave you missing out much.",the_incredible_hulk,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1
"When this movie came out i rated it 10/10, but after a few rewatching days, it wasnt as good. It stays a super fun movie, but from a business perspectve, the producers made some wrong choices. I get the things they decided with the script, but it was a little weak.

"Shazam is fun and entertaining! It succeeds in going back to basics with the superhero genre by tapping our sense of awe and wonder. This style is reminiscent of the early Superman movies. Good move by Warner Bros/DC to deviate from the brooding superhero style that only works for Batman. At first, when I saw the trailer for Shazam, I was a little worried that it might be too comedic for its own good. But after seeing the movie, I felt that it suits the character. Humor can actually help if combined well with action and great special effects. The movie has heart too. It's about family and friendship, and it also touches on bullying, disabilities and acceptance. It's a fun ride. A back-to-basics, family-friendly superhero fun ride! Looking forward to a sequel.",shazam,DC Extended Universe,DC Extended Universe,0,0,DC Extended Universe,0,DC Extended Universe,0,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,DC Extended Universe,0,DC Extended Universe,0
"Godzilla: King of the Monsters was the first Monsterverse movie I learnt about. My friend is a huge fan of kaiju movies and he showed me the trailer of this movie when it first came out. I was struck in awe. I couldn't believe something so legendary looking was actually going to be made while I live. The poster and promotional materials were also looking so much filled with fantasy. I watched the 2014 Godzilla to watch this. If you've seen my review of that movie, you will know how much I loved it except for the human part. But when I watched this movie, I was very dissatisfied.
The problem that plagues Godzilla: King of the Monsters is the humans. First of all they are talking so much. The whole time all we see is talking, talking and even more talking. First Madison and her mother are talking, then the army is talking, then the eco terrorists are talking. And finally when Godzilla and Kong Ghidorah finally start fighting, then seen cuts to the humans running. Look, I have no problem with humans being shown in Godzilla movies. But it should be like the 2014 movie, where humans are only shown when the monsters are walking and not during the fights.
The human plot of this movie is very pathetic. The eco terrorists had a point and I completely agreed with them, but as it was shown how they are supposed to be the bad guys was not very surprising. I have never understood movies which villify eco-terrorists. Like, why don't they ever explain why they are supposed to be bad? Take a moment, think about valid points and just speak them out. It doesn't have to be ""you're the bad guy boo-hoo!"". This only makes us feel like the bad guys won.
The CGI, however, is where this movie is an absolute win. I will give it full marks for that. I just love all the fight scenes from it. When Rodan seemed to have killed Mothra I was feeling very bad for her, but seeing how she made a comeback was very surprising. The part where Rodan and King Ghidorah fight the planes was also very cool. I really wanted to show that scene to someone else (sadly I'm the only person who is interested in Monsterverse and those who are interested already watched the movie before me).
Godzilla: King of the Monsters is a movie that completely tested my patience. It was fun, I'm gonna remember all the monster scenes, but I don't think I'm ever gonna have the courage to watch this ever again. Some things are best left in memory, and that's what I'd say about this movie. It's a good thing Godzilla vs Kong removed the bad parts and made what we wanted to see. That's how this franchise is supposed to be, not like this one.",godzilla_king_of_the_monsters_2019,MonsterVerse,MonsterVerse,2,2,MonsterVerse,2,MonsterVerse,2,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,MonsterVerse,2,MonsterVerse,2
"Not quite top tier MCU, but very close. This is the second best crossover ever on screen, after the first Avengers. The film manages to balance so many characters and plotlines perfectly. Yes, there are some flaws like the sheer amount of storylines audiences must keep up with at once and             *SPOILERS*                                                      Gamora'a fridging                                    *END OF SPOILERS*                                        But overall this is such a fun experience, and the Russo Bros's best directorial work yet.",avengers_infinity_war,Marvel Cinematic Universe,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Star Wars,3,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1
"There are a lot of mixed feeling about this movie. It's not bad, it's just boring. The characters didn't have enough development and the whole dark elves idea was not very interesting. What i like about the movie is the chemistry between Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston, the are adorable! It doesn't really have a lot of jokes and is a more dark toned Marvel movie.

"Skull Island is more Donkey Kong than King Kong. Viewers are given a primal and stoic version of Kong that spends most of the movie smashing helicopters or prehistoric looking lizards. Not only is this version of Kong unlikable, but the group of scientists and soldiers that venture out to the island constitute a rather bland group of characters. You'll care so little about the characters as to not remember who actually survived at the end of the movie. The movie is so determined to make it a slugfest that the characters deliberately walk into danger, while
the monsters are completely impervious to projectiles. Skull Island does occasionally pay lip-service to an emotional connection, but it mostly lacks the caring and love between humans and animal in the face of cruelty that made previous King Kong movies great.",kong_skull_island,MonsterVerse,MonsterVerse,2,2,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,MonsterVerse,2,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1,MonsterVerse,2,Marvel Cinematic Universe,1
