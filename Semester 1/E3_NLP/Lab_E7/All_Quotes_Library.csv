I also watch a lot of World cinema through DVDs mostly brought by one of my best friends who's now based in Toronto.",A. R. Rahman,a-r-rahman
"I follow a simple formula when I compose. I ask myself, 'What would the audience want to hear?' and 'Why would they buy my CDs?' And the process of answering these questions through music follows. Sometimes, it works. Sometimes, it backfires.",A. R. Rahman,a-r-rahman
"Compared with other Indian film composers, I only write about six movies a year. Others write up to 60.",A. R. Rahman,a-r-rahman

"My mother's belief in spiritual healers grew stronger after our family went through a rough patch following my father's death.

"If you respect a language and culture, it shows in your work.",A. R. Rahman,a-r-rahman
"When I travel with my kids abroad, I am not myself, but I'm more a father who wants to protect them. Sometimes, I am even aggressive about certain things and get surprised seeing myself like that: for instance, when people want to take pictures of them. I am fine if they want to take my pictures, but they are not public property.",A. R. Rahman,a-r-rahman
"I like to see a film and then start scoring it in my mind while doing something unrelated. You just grasp a film and start working, and something unpredictable comes out from a third element. The mind, the more active it is, the more productive it is.",A. R. Rahman,a-r-rahman
"I basically love classical music. I love a lot of musicians playing together and the whole culture of that, whether it's Indian or it's Western.",A. R. Rahman,a-r-rahman

That the object of the Brahmins in giving up beef-eating was to snatch away from the Buddhist Bhikshus the supremacy they had acquired is evidenced by the adoption of vegetarianism by Brahmins.,B. R. Ambedkar,b-r-ambedkar
"The food habits of the different classes of Hindus have been as fixed and stratified as their cults. Just as Hindus can be classified on their basis of their cults, so also they can be classified on the basis of their habits of food.",B. R. Ambedkar,b-r-ambedkar
Some people think that religion is not essential to society. I do not hold this view. I consider the foundation of religion to be essential to the life and practices of a society.,B. R. Ambedkar,b-r-ambedkar
"Some men say that they should be satisfied with the abolition of untouchability only, leaving the caste system alone. The aim of abolition of untouchability alone without trying to abolish the inequalities inherent in the caste system is a rather low aim.",B. R. Ambedkar,b-r-ambedkar
"Caste may be bad. Caste may lead to conduct so gross as to be called man's inhumanity to man. All the same, it must be recognized that the Hindus observe Caste not because they are inhuman or wrong-headed. They observe Caste because they are deeply religious.",B. R. Ambedkar,b-r-ambedkar
There is one taboo against meat-eating. It divides Hindus into vegetarians and flesh eaters. There is another taboo which is against beef eating. It divides Hindus into those who eat cow's flesh and those who do not.,B. R. Ambedkar,b-r-ambedkar
"In Hinduism, conscience, reason and independent thinking have no scope for development.",B. R. Ambedkar,b-r-ambedkar
"People are not wrong in observing Caste. In my view, what is wrong is their religion, which has inculcated this notion of Caste. If this is correct, then obviously the enemy, you must grapple with is not the people who observe Caste, but the Shastras which teach them this religion of Caste.",B. R. Ambedkar,b-r-ambedkar
"The Touchables, whether they are vegetarians or flesh-eaters, are united in their objection to eat cow's flesh. As against them stand the Untouchables, who eat cow's flesh without compunction and as a matter of course and habit.",B. R. Ambedkar,b-r-ambedkar
"No Hindu community, however low, will touch cow's flesh. On the other hand, there is no community which is really an Untouchable community which has not something to do with the dead cow. Some eat her flesh, some remove the skin, some manufacture articles out of her skin and bones.",B. R. Ambedkar,b-r-ambedkar
"My social philosophy may be said to be enshrined in three words: liberty, equality and fraternity. Let no one, however, say that I have borrowed by philosophy from the French Revolution. I have not. My philosophy has roots in religion and not in political science. I have derived them from the teachings of my Master, the Buddha.",B. R. Ambedkar,b-r-ambedkar
"Why is it that a large majority of Hindus do not inter-dine and do not inter-marry? Why is it that your cause is not popular? There can be only one answer to this question, and it is that inter-dining and inter-marriage are repugnant to the beliefs and dogmas which the Hindus regard as sacred.",B. R. Ambedkar,b-r-ambedkar
"Generally speaking, the Smritikars never care to explain the why and the how of their dogmas.",B. R. Ambedkar,b-r-ambedkar
"One can quite understand vegetarianism. One can quite understand meat-eating. But it is difficult to understand why a person who is a flesh-eater should object to one kind of flesh, namely cow's flesh. This is an anomaly which call for explanation.",B. R. Ambedkar,b-r-ambedkar
"That the caste system must be abolished if the Hindu society is to be reconstructed on the basis of equality, goes without saying. Untouchability has its roots in the caste system. They cannot expect the Brahmins to rise in revolt against the caste system. Also we cannot rely upon the non-Brahmins and ask them to fight our battle.",B. R. Ambedkar,b-r-ambedkar
Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other time. We are the ones we've been waiting for. We are the change that we seek.,Barack Obama,barack-obama

"Money is not the only answer, but it makes a difference.",Barack Obama,barack-obama
"Now, as a nation, we don't promise equal outcomes, but we were founded on the idea everybody should have an equal opportunity to succeed. No matter who you are, what you look like, where you come from, you can make it. That's an essential promise of America. Where you start should not determine where you end up.",Barack Obama,barack-obama
"We, the People, recognize that we have responsibilities as well as rights; that our destinies are bound together; that a freedom which only asks what's in it for me, a freedom without a commitment to others, a freedom without love or charity or duty or patriotism, is unworthy of our founding ideals, and those who died in their defense.",Barack Obama,barack-obama
There is not a liberal America and a conservative America - there is the United States of America. There is not a black America and a white America and latino America and asian America - there's the United States of America.,Barack Obama,barack-obama
Focusing your life solely on making a buck shows a certain poverty of ambition. It asks too little of yourself. Because it's only when you hitch your wagon to something larger than yourself that you realize your true potential.,Barack Obama,barack-obama
If the people cannot trust their government to do the job for which it exists - to protect them and to promote their common welfare - all else is lost.,Barack Obama,barack-obama

"Understand, our police officers put their lives on the line for us every single day. They've got a tough job to do to maintain public safety and hold accountable those who break the law.",Barack Obama,barack-obama
"It's not surprising, then, they get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren't like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations.",Barack Obama,barack-obama
"I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. I am not in favor of gay marriage. But when you start playing around with constitutions, just to prohibit somebody who cares about another person, it just seems to me that's not what America's about. Usually, our constitutions expand liberties, they don't contract them.",Barack Obama,barack-obama
We proved that we are still a people capable of doing big things and tackling our biggest challenges.,Barack Obama,barack-obama

"In a world of complex threats, our security and leadership depends on all elements of our power - including strong and principled diplomacy.",Barack Obama,barack-obama
"We cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives that we've set. We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.",Barack Obama,barack-obama
"It was the labor movement that helped secure so much of what we take for granted today. The 40-hour work week, the minimum wage, family leave, health insurance, Social Security, Medicare, retirement plans. The cornerstones of the middle-class security all bear the union label.",Barack Obama,barack-obama

I'm the president of the United States. I'm not the emperor of the United States.,Barack Obama,barack-obama
"A good compromise, a good piece of legislation, is like a good sentence; or a good piece of music. Everybody can recognize it. They say, 'Huh. It works. It makes sense.'",Barack Obama,barack-obama
"So long as I'm Commander-in-Chief, we will sustain the strongest military the world has ever known. When you take off the uniform, we will serve you as well as you've served us - because no one who fights for this country should have to fight for a job, or a roof over their head, or the care that they need when they come home.",Barack Obama,barack-obama

"No party has a monopoly on wisdom. No democracy works without compromise. But when Governor Romney and his allies in Congress tell us we can somehow lower our deficit by spending trillions more on new tax breaks for the wealthy - well, you do the math. I refuse to go along with that. And as long as I'm President, I never will.",Barack Obama,barack-obama
"My job is not to represent Washington to you, but to represent you to Washington.",Barack Obama,barack-obama
We need to reject any politics that targets people because of race or religion. This isn't a matter of political correctness. It's a matter of understanding what makes us strong. The world respects us not just for our arsenal; it respects us for our diversity and our openness and the way we respect every faith.,Barack Obama,barack-obama
I don't oppose all wars. What I am opposed to is a dumb war. What I am opposed to is a rash war.,Barack Obama,barack-obama
"The United States is not, and never will be, at war with Islam.",Barack Obama,barack-obama
"We need to steer clear of this poverty of ambition, where people want to drive fancy cars and wear nice clothes and live in nice apartments but don't want to work hard to accomplish these things. Everyone should try to realize their full potential.",Barack Obama,barack-obama

"We want everybody to act like adults, quit playing games, realize that it's not just my way or the highway.",Barack Obama,barack-obama
"It's time to fundamentally change the way that we do business in Washington.

"If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help... Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you've got a business - you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen.",Barack Obama,barack-obama
This is the moment when we must come together to save this planet. Let us resolve that we will not leave our children a world where the oceans rise and famine spreads and terrible storms devastate our lands.,Barack Obama,barack-obama
Our higher education system is one of the things that makes America exceptional. There's no place else that has the assets we do when it comes to higher education. People from all over the world aspire to come here and study here. And that is a good thing.,Barack Obama,barack-obama
We can't drive our SUVs and eat as much as we want and keep our homes on 72 degrees at all times... and then just expect that other countries are going to say OK. That's not leadership. That's not going to happen.,Barack Obama,barack-obama
We have real enemies in the world. These enemies must be found. They must be pursued and they must be defeated.,Barack Obama,barack-obama

"Fixing a broken immigration system. Protecting our kids from gun violence. Equal pay for equal work, paid leave, raising the minimum wage.

The moon gravitates towards the earth and by the force of gravity is continually drawn off from a rectilinear motion and retained in its orbit.,Isaac Newton,isaac-newton
The proper method for inquiring after the properties of things is to deduce them from experiments.,Isaac Newton,isaac-newton
"If a projectile were deprived of the force of gravity, it would not be deflected toward the earth but would go off in a straight line into the heavens and do so with uniform motion, provided that the resistance of the air were removed.",Isaac Newton,isaac-newton

"Religion and philosophy are to be preserved distinct. We are not to introduce divine revelations into philosophy, nor philosophical opinions into religion.",Isaac Newton,isaac-newton
"Why there is one body in our System qualified to give light and heat to all the rest, I know no reason but because the Author of the System thought it convenient; and why there is but one body of this kind, I know no reason, but because one was sufficient to warm and enlighten all the rest.",Isaac Newton,isaac-newton
"The best and safest method of philosophizing seems to be first to inquire diligently into the properties of things, and establishing those properties by experiments, and then to proceed more slowly to hypotheses for the explanation of them.",Isaac Newton,isaac-newton
"The same thing is to be understood of all bodies, revolved in any orbits. They all endeavour to recede from the centres of their orbits, and were it not for the opposition of a contrary force which restrains them to and detains them in their orbits, which I therefore call Centripetal, would fly off in right lines with a uniform motion.",Isaac Newton,isaac-newton
"'God' is a relative word and has a respect to servants, and 'Deity' is the dominion of God, not over his own body, as those imagine who fancy God to be the soul of the world, but over servants.",Isaac Newton,isaac-newton
"The same law takes place in a system, consisting of many bodies, as in one single body, with regard to their persevering in their state of motion or of rest. For the progressive motion, whether of one single body or of a whole system of bodies, is always to be estimated from the motion of the center of gravity.",Isaac Newton,isaac-newton
"Christ comes as a thief in the night, & it is not for us to know the times & seasons which God hath put into his own breast.",Isaac Newton,isaac-newton
"In experimental philosophy, we are to look upon propositions inferred by general induction from phenomena as accurately or very nearly true, notwithstanding any contrary hypotheses that may be imagined, till such time as other phenomena occur by which they may either be made more accurate or liable to exceptions.",Isaac Newton,isaac-newton
The Ignis Fatuus is a vapor shining without heat.,Isaac Newton,isaac-newton
"Resistance is usually ascribed to bodies at rest, and impulse to those in motion, but motion and rest, as commonly conceived, are only relatively distinguished; nor are those bodies always truly at rest, which commonly are taken to be so.",Isaac Newton,isaac-newton
"The word 'God' usually signifies 'Lord', but every lord is not a God. It is the dominion of a spiritual being which constitutes a God: a true, supreme, or imaginary dominion makes a true, supreme, or imaginary God.",Isaac Newton,isaac-newton
Nothing can be divided into more parts than it can possibly be constituted of. But matter (i.e. finite) cannot be constituted of infinite parts.,Isaac Newton,isaac-newton
"It may be that there is no such thing as an equable motion, whereby time may be accurately measured. All motions may be accelerated or retarded, but the true, or equable, progress of absolute time is liable to no change.",Isaac Newton,isaac-newton
"Just as the system of the sun, planets and comets is put in motion by the forces of gravity, and its parts persist in their motions, so the smaller systems of bodies also seem to be set in motion by other forces and their particles to be variously moved in relation to each other and, especially, by the electric force.",Isaac Newton,isaac-newton
"The motions which the planets now have could not spring from any natural cause alone, but were impressed by an intelligent Agent.",Isaac Newton,isaac-newton

We are to admit no more causes of natural things than such as are both true and sufficient to explain their appearances.,Isaac Newton,isaac-newton
"In the beginning of the year 1665, I found the method of approximating series and the rule for reducing any dignity of any binomial into such a series.",Isaac Newton,isaac-newton
"If the experiments which I urge be defective, it cannot be difficult to show the defects; but if valid, then by proving the theory, they must render all objections invalid.",Isaac Newton,isaac-newton

"Myth and fairy-story must, as all art, reflect and contain in solution elements of moral and religious truth (or error), but not explicit, not in the known form of the primary 'real' world.",J. R. R. Tolkien,j-r-r-tolkien
"If you really want to know what Middle-earth is based on, it's my wonder and delight in the earth as it is, particularly the natural earth.",J. R. R. Tolkien,j-r-r-tolkien

The original 'Hobbit' was never intended to have a sequel - Bilbo 'remained very happy to the end of his days and those were extraordinarily long': a sentence I find an almost insuperable obstacle to a satisfactory link.,J. R. R. Tolkien,j-r-r-tolkien
"It is plain indeed that in spite of later estrangement Hobbits are relatives of ours: far nearer to us than Elves, or even than Dwarves. Of old they spoke the languages of Men, after their own fashion, and liked and disliked much the same things as Men did. But what exactly our relationship is can no longer be discovered.",J. R. R. Tolkien,j-r-r-tolkien
"In October 1920 I went to Leeds as Reader in English Language, with a free commission to develop the linguistic side of a large and growing School of English Studies, in which no regular provision had as yet been made for the linguistic specialist.",J. R. R. Tolkien,j-r-r-tolkien
"Middle English is an exciting field - almost uncharted, I begin to think, because as soon as one turns detailed personal attention on to any little corner of it, the received notions and ideas seem to crumple up and fall to pieces - as far as language goes, at any rate.",J.

"When I understand myself, I understand you, and out of that understanding comes love.",Jiddu Krishnamurti,jiddu-krishnamurti
"Truth cannot be brought down; rather, the individual must make the effort to ascend to it. You cannot bring the mountaintop to the valley.

"We never look deeply into the quality of a tree; we never really touch it, feel its solidity, its rough bark, and hear the sound that is part of the tree.

"Meditation is a state of mind which looks at everything with complete attention, totally, not just parts of it. And no one can teach you how to be attentive.

"Life cannot be without relationship, but we have made it so agonizing and hideous by basing it on personal and possessive love. Can one love and yet not possess?

"When you draw or paint a tree, you do not imitate the tree; you do not copy it exactly as it is, which would be mere photography. To be free to paint a tree or a flower or a sunset, you have to feel what it conveys to you: the significance, the meaning of it.",Jiddu Krishnamurti,jiddu-krishnamurti
"When the mind is empty, silent, when it is in a state of complete negation - which is not blankness, nor the opposite of being positive, but a totally different state in which all thought has ceased - only then is it possible for that which is unnameable to come into being.",Jiddu Krishnamurti,jiddu-krishnamurti
"Love is the missing factor; there is a lack of affection, of warmth in relationship; and because we lack that love, that tenderness, that generosity, that mercy in relationship, we escape into mass action, which produces further confusion, further misery.",Jiddu Krishnamurti,jiddu-krishnamurti
"It is odd that we have so little relationship with nature, with the insects and the leaping frog and the owl that hoots among the hills calling for its mate. We never seem to have a feeling for all living things on the earth.",Jiddu Krishnamurti,jiddu-krishnamurti
"The environment that we call society is created by past generations; we accept it, as it helps us to maintain our greed, possessiveness, illusion.",Jiddu Krishnamurti,jiddu-krishnamurti
"The question of whether or not there is a God or truth or reality or whatever you like to call it, can never be answered by books, by priests, philosopher's or saviours.

"Truth, being limitless, unconditioned, unapproachable by any path whatsoever, cannot be organized; nor should any organization be formed to lead or to coerce people along any particular path. If you first understand that, then you will see how impossible it is to organize a belief.",Jiddu Krishnamurti,jiddu-krishnamurti
This is love: the flowering of love is meditation.,Jiddu Krishnamurti,jiddu-krishnamurti
"We do not know what love is. We know the symptoms of it, the pleasure, the pain, the fear, the anxiety and so on. We try to solve the symptoms, which becomes a wandering in darkness. We spend our days and nights in this, and it is soon over in death.",Jiddu Krishnamurti,jiddu-krishnamurti
Listening has importance only when one is not projecting one's own desires through which one listens.,Jiddu Krishnamurti,jiddu-krishnamurti
"Have you ever asked yourselves what you are going to do when you grow up?

"The people who hold that our culture is an oppressive patriarchy, they don't want to admit that the current hierarchy might be predicated on competence.",Jordan Peterson,jordan-peterson

"One of the things I've told men over and over and over and over is if you're being rejected by all the women that you approach, it's not the women!",Jordan Peterson,jordan-peterson
We're so immaturely cynical as a culture. We're not wise enough to look at an institution like marriage and to really things about what it means and what it signifies. It signifies a place where people can tie the ropes of their lives together so that they're stronger. It signifies a place where people can tell the truth to one another.,Jordan Peterson,jordan-peterson

"Assuming if there's such a thing as reality, if you have a false relationship with it, how can you do anything but fail?",Jordan Peterson,jordan-peterson
"Part of the core information that I've been purveying is that identity politics is a sick game. You don't play racial, ethnic, and gender identity games. The Left plays them on behalf of the oppressed, let's say, and the Right tends to play them on behalf of nationalism and ethnic pride. I think they're equally dangerous.",Jordan Peterson,jordan-peterson
I happen to be a big fan of Western civilization; I think it beats the hell out of tyranny and starvation.,Jordan Peterson,jordan-peterson

We have to rediscover the eternal values and then live them out.,Jordan Peterson,jordan-peterson
"You can say, 'Well, isn't it unfortunate that chaos is represented by the feminine' - well, it might be unfortunate, but it doesn't matter, because that is how it's represented. It's been represented like that forever. And there are reasons for it. You can't change it. It's not possible. This is underneath everything.",Jordan Peterson,jordan-peterson
"I have a hard time figuring out what kind of box to put me in, too, because I don't know exactly what's going on around me or why. But I need to stay outside of boxes because then I can look at what's inside of them without being part of them.",Jordan Peterson,jordan-peterson
I am not going to be a mouthpiece for language that I detest.,Jordan Peterson,jordan-peterson

"In summers, while growing up in India, we often slept in the courtyard under the stars.",Kalpana Chawla,kalpana-chawla
"The first view of the Earth is magical. It is a very overpowering realization that the Earth is so small. It affected me. I could not get over the notion that in such a small planet, with such a small ribbon of life, so much goes on. It is as if the whole place is sacred.",Kalpana Chawla,kalpana-chawla
"When you lift off, the pressure is supposed to be maximum. But actually, it was very benign. Very enjoyable. But as soon as the engines cut off and you get to zero gravity, you felt as if you were being pushed off your seat. You feel disoriented. You don't feel aligned with anything. I felt for a few good hours that I was falling.",Kalpana Chawla,kalpana-chawla
It's easy for me to be motivated and inspired by seeing somebody who just goes all out to do something.,Kalpana Chawla,kalpana-chawla

"Sometimes I had to spend a whole day mixing a boiling mass with a heavy iron rod nearly as large as myself. I would be broken with fatigue at the day's end.

"We should not allow it to be believed that all scientific progress can be reduced to mechanisms, machines, gearings, even though such machinery also has its beauty. Neither do I believe that the spirit of adventure runs any risk of disappearing in our world.",Marie Curie,marie-curie
"I was only fifteen when I finished my high-school studies, always having held first rank in my class. The fatigue of growth and study compelled me to take almost a year's rest in the country. I then returned to my father in Warsaw, hoping to teach in the free schools.",Marie Curie,marie-curie

"During the year 1894, Pierre Curie wrote me letters that seem to me admirable in their form. No one of them was very long, for he had the habit of concise expression, but all were written in a spirit of sincerity and with an evident anxiety to make the one he desired as a companion know him as he was.",Marie Curie,marie-curie

"Think about what people are doing on Facebook today. They're keeping up with their friends and family, but they're also building an image and identity for themselves, which in a sense is their brand.

"Advertising works most effectively when it's in line with what people are already trying to do. And people are trying to communicate in a certain way on Facebook - they share information with their friends, they learn about what their friends are doing - so there's really a whole new opportunity for a new type of advertising model within that.",Mark Zuckerberg,mark-zuckerberg

I myself eschew all stimulants. I also practically abstain from meat.,Nikola Tesla,nikola-tesla
"There is no doubt that some plant food, such as oatmeal, is more economical than meat, and superior to it in regard to both mechanical and mental performance.

The struggle for existence being lessened, there should be development along ideal rather than material lines.",Nikola Tesla,nikola-tesla

"All knowledge or form conception is evoked through the medium of the eye, either in response to disturbances directly received on the retina or to their fainter secondary effects and reverberations. Other sense organs can only call forth feelings which have no reality of existence and of which no conception can be formed.",Nikola Tesla,nikola-tesla
"The earth is bountiful, and where her bounty fails, nitrogen drawn from the air will refertilize her womb. I developed a process for this purpose in 1900. It was perfected fourteen years later under the stress of war by German chemists.",Nikola Tesla,nikola-tesla
"When a coil is operated with currents of very high frequency, beautiful brush effects may be produced, even if the coil be of comparatively small dimensions. The experimenter may vary them in many ways, and, if it were nothing else, they afford a pleasing sight.",Nikola Tesla,nikola-tesla
"We have soon to have everywhere smoke annihilators, dust absorbers, ozonizers, sterilizers of water, air, food and clothing, and accident preventers on streets, elevated roads and in subways. It will become next to impossible to contract disease germs or get hurt in the city, and country folk will got to town to rest and get well.",Nikola Tesla,nikola-tesla
The trend of opinion among eugenists is that we must make marriage more difficult. Certainly no one who is not a desirable parent should be permitted to produce progeny.,Nikola Tesla,nikola-tesla

"The newspapers of the twenty-first century will give a mere 'stick' in the back pages to accounts of crime or political controversies, but will headline on the front pages the proclamation of a new scientific hypothesis.",Nikola Tesla,nikola-tesla
"Of the various branches of electrical investigation, perhaps the most interesting and immediately the most promising is that dealing with alternating currents.",Nikola Tesla,nikola-tesla

"History and social sciences were my interests. I was always interested in knowing how societies get organized, why there is rich and poor divide, why there are classes. I was never apolitical. I think we are all political in a way. Politics decides our day-to-day life.",Pawan Kalyan,pawan-kalyan

There is a latent talent in everyone. I am nothing extraordinary just because I happen to be an actor. Everybody is extraordinary in his own way.

"Indian cinema needs all ingredients like emotion, action, sentiment and humour; it's not easy. It's easy to make a Hollywood film, as it goes with a pattern. Our cinema needs a lot of commercial ingredients. That's why I don't do many films.",Pawan Kalyan,pawan-kalyan
"I wanted to remain a bachelor from the beginning, but I got married thrice, and I don't know why I did it. I think it's not easy to live with me because of my impatience and busy schedules.

"In the business of entertainment, either I am able to create an effect that impresses people or not.",Ram Gopal Varma,ram-gopal-varma
"Stars work because of familiarity. They fill theatres because audiences know who they are. There is a brand equity.

Silence is ever speaking; it is the perennial flow of language.,Ramana Maharshi,ramana-maharshi

"If there is anything besides the Self there is reason to fear? Who sees the second? First, the ego arises and sees objects as external. If the ego does not rise, the Self alone exists and there is no second.",Ramana Maharshi,ramana-maharshi

Devotion complete culminates in knowledge supreme.,Ramana Maharshi,ramana-maharshi
"There is no doubt that breath control is the means for mind control because the mind, like breath, is a part of air; because the nature of mobility is common to both; because the place of origin is the same for both; and because when one of them is controlled, the other gets controlled.",Ramana Maharshi,ramana-maharshi
There is no doubt whatsoever that the universe is the merest illusion.,Ramana Maharshi,ramana-maharshi

"When there are thoughts, it is distraction: when there are no thoughts, it is meditation.",Ramana Maharshi,ramana-maharshi
"Even the structure of the atom has been found by the mind. Therefore the mind is subtler than the atom. That which is behind the mind, namely the individual soul, is subtler than the mind.",Ramana Maharshi,ramana-maharshi
God has no resolve; no karma attaches itself to Him.,Ramana Maharshi,ramana-maharshi
Actions yield result by the ordinance of God as He wills.,Ramana Maharshi,ramana-maharshi
"Every moment there is creation, every moment destruction. There is no absolute creation, no absolute destruction. Both are movement, and that is eternal.",Ramana Maharshi,ramana-maharshi
"Time is only an idea. There is only the Reality. Whatever you think it is, it looks like that. If you call it time, it is time. If you call it existence, it is existence, and so on. After calling it time, you divide it into days and nights, months, years, hours, minutes, etc. Time is immaterial for the Path of Knowledge.",Ramana Maharshi,ramana-maharshi
"The Self is self-luminous without darkness and light, and is the reality which is self-manifest. Therefore, one should not think of it as this or as that. The very thought of thinking will end in bondage.",Ramana Maharshi,ramana-maharshi
"Experiences such as, 'I went; I came; I was; I did,' come naturally to everyone. From these experiences, does it not appear that the consciousness 'I' is the subject of those various acts? Enquiry into the true nature of that consciousness, and remaining as oneself, is the way to understand, through enquiry, one's true nature.",Ramana Maharshi,ramana-maharshi

All activities and events that a body is to go through are determined at the time of conception.,Ramana Maharshi,ramana-maharshi
I have never said that there is no need for a guru. All depends on what you call guru. He need not be in a human form.,Ramana Maharshi,ramana-maharshi
"That which comes and goes, rises and sets, is born and dies is the ego. That which always abides, never changes, and is devoid of qualities is the Self.",Ramana Maharshi,ramana-maharshi
"Like the practice of breath control, meditation on the forms of God, repetition of mantras, food restrictions, etc., are but aids for rendering the mind quiescent.",Ramana Maharshi,ramana-maharshi
It is every intelligent man's experience that evildoing recoils on the doer sooner or later.,Ramana Maharshi,ramana-maharshi
"Society is the body; individuals are its members, its limbs. Just as the various limbs help and co-operate with one another and thus are happy, so each must unite with others in being helpful to all in thought, speech and action... One may see to the good of one's own group, i.e., the group that is immediate to him, and then proceed to others.",Ramana Maharshi,ramana-maharshi
"All bad qualities centre round the ego. When the ego is gone, Realisation results by itself. There are neither good nor bad qualities in the Self. The Self is free from all qualities. Qualities pertain to the mind only.",Ramana Maharshi,ramana-maharshi
"The mind itself is of the form of all, i.e., of soul, God and world; when it becomes of the form of the Self through knowledge, there is release, which is of the nature of Brahman: this is the teaching.",Ramana Maharshi,ramana-maharshi
"Concentration of the mind is in a way common to both Knowledge and Yoga. Yoga aims at union of the individual with the universal, the Reality. This Reality cannot be new. It must exist even now, and it does exist.",Ramana Maharshi,ramana-maharshi
The best way to meditate is through meditation itself.,Ramana Maharshi,ramana-maharshi

Consciousness is indeed always with us. Everyone knows 'I am!' No one can deny his own being.,Ramana Maharshi,ramana-maharshi
"The means that make one qualified for enquiry are meditation, yoga, etc. One should gain proficiency in these through graded practice and thus secure a stream of mental modes that is natural and helpful.",Ramana Maharshi,ramana-maharshi
"You need not aspire for or get any new state. Get rid of your present thoughts, that is all.",Ramana Maharshi,ramana-maharshi
"As instruments for knowing the objects, the sense organs are outside, and so they are called outer senses; and the mind is called the inner sense because it is inside. But the distinction between inner and outer is only with reference to the body; in truth, there is neither inner nor outer. The mind's nature is to remain pure like ether.",Ramana Maharshi,ramana-maharshi

"To each his own, but my process of preparation is based on conditions, not opposition.",Rohit Sharma,rohit-sharma
I am happy with the way I hit the ball. There is a certain element of power into it but not completely. It is like 80 per cent timing and 20 per cent power. Why do I need power hitting when I can clear the ropes with timing?,Rohit Sharma,rohit-sharma

"Of course I like to watch myself bat. After every innings, match, series, I do watch my own videos whenever I get the time.",Rohit Sharma,rohit-sharma

Acting is acting at the end of the day. How does it matter if it is in films or on TV?,Siddharth Shukla,siddharth-shukla
"I am not one of those actors who will abandon my flagship serial, my main claim to fame, just because I've done a hit movie.",Siddharth Shukla,siddharth-shukla
But the whole viewership of 'Balika Vadhu' is more than all shows of mine put together. The show has a lot of reach and that has worked for me.,Siddharth Shukla,siddharth-shukla
Link-ups go hand-in-hand with TV shows. You do a show and you get linked with your co-star.,Siddharth Shukla,siddharth-shukla

Humpty' was something I had to do. I had to stretch myself as an actor.,Siddharth Shukla,siddharth-shukla

That is something that you cannot say aloud, or perhaps even think.",Sigmund Freud,sigmund-freud
The goal of all life is death.,Sigmund Freud,sigmund-freud

"America is a mistake, a giant mistake.",Sigmund Freud,sigmund-freud

Dreams are often most profound when they seem the most crazy.,Sigmund Freud,sigmund-freud
"Man has, as it were, become a kind of prosthetic God. When he puts on all his auxiliary organs, he is truly magnificent; but those organs have not grown on him and they still give him much trouble at times.",Sigmund Freud,sigmund-freud
Illusions commend themselves to us because they save us pain and allow us to enjoy pleasure instead. We must therefore accept it without complaint when they sometimes collide with a bit of reality against which they are dashed to pieces.,Sigmund Freud,sigmund-freud
"America is the most grandiose experiment the world has seen, but, I am afraid, it is not going to be a success.",Sigmund Freud,sigmund-freud
Anatomy is destiny.,Sigmund Freud,sigmund-freud

"Just as a cautious businessman avoids investing all his capital in one concern, so wisdom would probably admonish us also not to anticipate all our happiness from one quarter alone.",Sigmund Freud,sigmund-freud

I only wish that ordinary people had an unlimited capacity for doing harm; then they might have an unlimited power for doing good.,Socrates,socrates

The poets are only the interpreters of the gods.,Socrates,socrates
"You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something - your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.",Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
"Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.

Great things in business are never done by one person. They're done by a team of people.,Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
"Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people's thinking.

Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don't lose faith.,Steve Jobs,steve-jobs

"Stay hungry, stay foolish.",Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
"For the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: 'If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?' And whenever the answer has been 'No' for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.",Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
"An iPod, a phone, an internet mobile communicator... these are NOT three separate devices! And we are calling it iPhone! Today Apple is going to reinvent the phone. And here it is.",Steve Jobs,steve-jobs

I believe life is an intelligent thing: that things aren't random.,Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
"Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn't really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while. That's because they were able to connect experiences they've had and synthesize new things.",Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
"That's been one of my mantras - focus and simplicity. Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it's worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains.",Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
It's not a faith in technology. It's faith in people.,Steve Jobs,steve-jobs

I want to put a ding in the universe.,Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
"Being the richest man in the cemetery doesn't matter to me. Going to bed at night saying we've done something wonderful, that's what matters to me.",Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
"Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life.

Things don't have to change the world to be important.,Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
"Sometimes when you innovate, you make mistakes. It is best to admit them quickly, and get on with improving your other innovations.",Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
"A lot of people in our industry haven't had very diverse experiences. So they don't have enough dots to connect, and they end up with very linear solutions without a broad perspective on the problem. The broader one's understanding of the human experience, the better design we will have.",Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
"Computers themselves, and software yet to be developed, will revolutionize the way we learn.",Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
"Design is a funny word. Some people think design means how it looks. But of course, if you dig deeper, it's really how it works.",Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
And one more thing.,Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
"No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there. And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life. It is Life's change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new.",Steve Jobs,steve-jobs

Everyone here has the sense that right now is one of those moments when we are influencing the future.,Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
My biological mother later found out that my mother had never graduated from college and that my father had never graduated from high school. She refused to sign the final adoption papers.

"It's not the tools that you have faith in - tools are just tools. They work, or they don't work. It's people you have faith in or not. Yeah, sure, I'm still optimistic I mean, I get pessimistic sometimes but not for long.",Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
"We don't get a chance to do that many things, and every one should be really excellent. Because this is our life. Life is brief, and then you die, you know? So this is what we've chosen to do with our life.",Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
"I didn't see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.",Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
We made the buttons on the screen look so good you'll want to lick them.,Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
We're just enthusiastic about what we do.,Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
Design is the fundamental soul of a man-made creation that ends up expressing itself in successive outer layers of the product or service. The iMac is not just the color or translucence or the shape of the shell. The essence of the iMac is to be the finest possible consumer computer in which each element plays together.,Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
"When you're young, you look at television and think, there's a conspiracy. The networks have conspired to dumb us down. But when you get a little older, you realize that's not true. The networks are in business to give people exactly what they want.",Steve Jobs,steve-jobs

"When you're a carpenter making a beautiful chest of drawers, you're not going to use a piece of plywood on the back, even though it faces the wall and nobody will ever see it. You'll know it's there, so you're going to use a beautiful piece of wood on the back.",Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
"Innovation has nothing to do with how many R & D dollars you have. When Apple came up with the Mac, IBM was spending at least 100 times more on R & D. It's not about money. It's about the people you have, how you're led, and how much you get it.",Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
My model for business is The Beatles: They were four guys that kept each others' negative tendencies in check; they balanced each other. And the total was greater than the sum of the parts.,Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
"The system is that there is no system. That doesn't mean we don't have process. Apple is a very disciplined company, and we have great processes. But that's not what it's about. Process makes you more efficient.",Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
"I was lucky - I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parents' garage when I was 20. We worked hard, and in 10 years, Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees.",Steve Jobs,steve-jobs

If you're gonna make connections which are innovative... you have to not have the same bag of experiences as everyone else does.,Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
"I have a great respect for incremental improvement, and I've done that sort of thing in my life, but I've always been attracted to the more revolutionary changes. I don't know why. Because they're harder. They're much more stressful emotionally. And you usually go through a period where everybody tells you that you've completely failed.",Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
We hire people who want to make the best things in the world.,Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
"For you to sleep well at night, the aesthetic, the quality, has to be carried all the way through.",Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
"I'm an optimist in the sense that I believe humans are noble and honorable, and some of them are really smart. I have a very optimistic view of individuals.",Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
"And it comes from saying no to 1,000 things to make sure we don't get on the wrong track or try to do too much. We're always thinking about new markets we could enter, but it's only by saying no that you can concentrate on the things that are really important.",Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
"As individuals, people are inherently good. I have a somewhat more pessimistic view of people in groups. And I remain extremely concerned when I see what's happening in our country, which is in many ways the luckiest place in the world. We don't seem to be excited about making our country a better place for our kids.",Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
"A lot of companies have chosen to downsize, and maybe that was the right thing for them. We chose a different path. Our belief was that if we kept putting great products in front of customers, they would continue to open their wallets.",Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
"I learned about serif and san serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great. It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can't capture, and I found it fascinating.",Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
"And no, we don't know where it will lead. We just know there's something much bigger than any of us here.",Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
"The over-all point is that new technology will not necessarily replace old technology, but it will date it. By definition. Eventually, it will replace it. But it's like people who had black-and-white TVs when color came out. They eventually decided whether or not the new technology was worth the investment.",Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
I think money is a wonderful thing because it enables you to do things. It enables you to invest in ideas that don't have a short-term payback.,Steve Jobs,steve-jobs

A good commander is benevolent and unconcerned with fame.,Sun Tzu,sun-tzu

"He who is prudent and lies in wait for an enemy who is not, will be victorious.",Sun Tzu,sun-tzu
"If you are far from the enemy, make him believe you are near.",Sun Tzu,sun-tzu

The quality of decision is like the well-timed swoop of a falcon which enables it to strike and destroy its victim.,Sun Tzu,sun-tzu

"If ignorant both of your enemy and yourself, you are certain to be in peril.",Sun Tzu,sun-tzu
Supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting.,Sun Tzu,sun-tzu
"The general who advances without coveting fame and retreats without fearing disgrace, whose only thought is to protect his country and do good service for his sovereign, is the jewel of the kingdom.",Sun Tzu,sun-tzu
"Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been won, whereas he who is destined to defeat first fights and afterwards looks for victory.",Sun Tzu,sun-tzu
"Confront them with annihilation, and they will then survive; plunge them into a deadly situation, and they will then live. When people fall into danger, they are then able to strive for victory.",Sun Tzu,sun-tzu
For to win one hundred victories in one hundred battles is not the acme of skill. To subdue the enemy without fighting is the acme of skill.,Sun Tzu,sun-tzu
Balk the enemy's power; force him to reveal himself.,Sun Tzu,sun-tzu
"Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and you know yourself, your victory will not stand in doubt; if you know Heaven and you know Earth, you may make your victory complete.",Sun Tzu,sun-tzu

Secret operations are essential in war; upon them the army relies to make its every move.,Sun Tzu,sun-tzu

I despise women wearing too much makeup. It hides their actual beauty.,Sushant Singh Rajput,sushant-singh-rajput
"I might not be over-enthusiastic about socialising and making friends, but I am not a loner. I love hanging out with my friends, and I do it often when I am not working.

"Along with some of my college friends, I would often bunk classes and drive to Murthal, which is about 50 km from New Delhi, just to have some piping hot parathas.

"I love soccer, love tennis... Roger Federer has been a favourite for a long, long time. The kind of consistency he has shown, 16 Grand Slam titles...

"I love tattoos. And mine symbolise who I really am. I have a Samurai on my left arm. At a subconscious level, I connect to this warrior and model myself on his discipline, skills and honour. There is also a tribal tattoo and a Chinese symbol of faith. I have seen a lot of people getting tattoos just because it's a trend.",Virat Kohli,virat-kohli
"I've never fought with anyone. A lot of people talk to me, and they're like, 'Oh, you would have been fighting all the time when you were younger,' but I'm like, 'I never fought with anyone because I always knew that if I hurt myself, I might lose important time in my cricket career,' so I never got into any fight, ever in my life.",Virat Kohli,virat-kohli
"My focus had always been the on-side. My coach wanted me to work on the offside strokes since he was convinced of my ability and timing on the leg side. I worked hard and firmed up my defensive technique. I am happy getting runs all around the wicket now, and getting a lot of boundaries. No one calls me a 'leggie batsman' anymore.",Virat Kohli,virat-kohli
