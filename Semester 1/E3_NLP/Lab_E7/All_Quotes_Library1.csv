Being a known person is pretty much all I've known. I don't remember much of a time when people didn't know who I was.,Dakota Fanning,dakota-fanning
"I know how to hit a mark without looking. I instinctively know where my eye line should be. That's all 100%. But your character and the story are always different, so the emotional part is not muscle memory. You're still surprised by stuff and get the adrenaline.",Dakota Fanning,dakota-fanning
"Someone once said about me that I talk to everyone the same, no matter what age they are. I don't see kids and adults. I see everyone the same.",Dakota Fanning,dakota-fanning
"Often, when you're on a movie set, you're miserable. It's cold. You're hungry. You're tired. It's still dark out. And yet, there's no place I'd rather be. It's the happiest I am, and the most calm.",Dakota Fanning,dakota-fanning
"I don't know whether it's audiences or filmmakers who want characters to be likable today, but I don't think actors are afraid of their characters being unlikable.",Dakota Fanning,dakota-fanning

"It's hard to remember, when you look at a magazine or when you look at pictures of people, and you forget that those people are people like you. They have flaws and insecurities. That's so easy to forget, even for me, as somebody who's sometimes in those magazines.",Dakota Fanning,dakota-fanning
"I'm the girl that's on the beach with a hat on, under an umbrella. Like, very shaded. But my weird thing is, I only tan my legs. My whole body's covered in the shade, and I tan my legs.",Dakota Fanning,dakota-fanning
I never skimp on TV. I watch an embarrassing amount of TV shows. I don't even know how I do it.,Dakota Fanning,dakota-fanning
"Charlie Sheen gave me a signed headshot. I think it said, 'Keep it real.' But 'real' was spelled 'reel,' like a film reel.",Dakota Fanning,dakota-fanning
I was raised by very traditional Southern parents with Southern manners. You don't air your dirty laundry to people that aren't your family or your friends. Why would I ever want to portray myself as anything other than together?,Dakota Fanning,dakota-fanning
"Everyone in New York is very self-involved. They're focused on themselves. Like, walking down the street, people are just in their own zone.",Dakota Fanning,dakota-fanning

"We can't continue to take from our planet the way we do and not give anything back, and the idea of, 'Oh, but it's fine, I won't have to deal with it in my lifetime,' well, you need to think about the future generations who will have to deal with it.",Dakota Fanning,dakota-fanning
"It's rare to see women in a film who are not somehow validated by a male or discussing a male or heartbroken by a male,or end up being happy because of a male. It's interesting to think about, and it's very true.",Dakota Fanning,dakota-fanning
"There's a history where, when women get to a certain age in this industry, the roles become strictly the mother, the wife, or the older single woman. There should be more of a variety because there are so many different paths that humans take, and they should be given a platform to be seen.",Dakota Fanning,dakota-fanning
"When I'm working, even though it's sometimes challenging and difficult, there's still no place I would rather be.",Dakota Fanning,dakota-fanning
"I think what has helped me is that I've never thought of myself as a child star. If you think of yourself like that, you might have problems!",Dakota Fanning,dakota-fanning
There is a lot of negativity that you welcome into your life when you're an actor. You bare your soul for anyone to see.,Dakota Fanning,dakota-fanning
I think I am the same kind of person I would have been if I wasn't an actor. I am not a robot.,Dakota Fanning,dakota-fanning
"When people say hello to me, I feel like maybe I know them from somewhere, because they say, like, 'Hi! How are you?' And I'm like, 'Oh, hi!' And then I realize, 'Oh, no, they just think they know me because they watched me in a movie.' Which is cool, but definitely not a normal thing.",Dakota Fanning,dakota-fanning
"In New York, you walk everywhere, so you're amongst people all of the time, and everybody is in a hurry and going somewhere or has something on their minds. And in L.A., it's still much more of a laid-back life, at least in my experience.",Dakota Fanning,dakota-fanning

Why would anyone get married and have babies? That's the dumbest idea I've ever heard in my life. Or the scariest thing I've ever heard in my life.,Aziz Ansari,aziz-ansari

It's the hardest thing to come up with an hour of material that can consistently keep people laughing.,Aziz Ansari,aziz-ansari
"When I tour, it's like, well, like a food tour as much as a comedy tour. I try to eat at all the weird places, the obscure barbecue joints, burger places. There are a few spots in L.A. that I'm obsessed with - one of them is the Taco Zone taco truck on Alvarado. There are secret off-menu items that are amazing.",Aziz Ansari,aziz-ansari
"I'm the kind of person, if I see something, like a funny video, I want to share it. With Twitter and Tumblr you can do that on a mass scale, and people get to know your personality.",Aziz Ansari,aziz-ansari
"I guess after college, I just got really into food. I also think going on the road doing stand-up makes you more into food. Because when you travel like that, one of the things to do is find really good places to eat.",Aziz Ansari,aziz-ansari

I was a dishwasher at one of those Japanese places that cook on your table. Not too fun.,Aziz Ansari,aziz-ansari
"It's hard to really get that excited about movies. Think about it like this: how many good comedy movies come out a year? Maybe one or two? And then, in those movies, what are the chances that there's a character that I'm the best fit to play? It's really small!",Aziz Ansari,aziz-ansari

I weirdly do consider myself an optimist about love.,Aziz Ansari,aziz-ansari
"Every time I've done comedy in, like, traditional comedy clubs, there's always these comedians that do really well with audiences but that the other comedians hate because they're just, you know, doing kind of cheap stuff like dancing around or doing, like, very kind of base sex humor a lot, and stuff like that.",Aziz Ansari,aziz-ansari
"With stand-up, it's more interesting to hear about people's failures than their successes.",Aziz Ansari,aziz-ansari

A lot of people my age think stand up sucks.,Aziz Ansari,aziz-ansari
I'm so jealous of people who have crushes on people they go to school with or work with. That's such a blessing. You actually get to see them all the time and spend time with them.,Aziz Ansari,aziz-ansari
"After you do a joke a few times, you have material that you know works. Although sometimes I have a joke that has worked a bunch of times and then one night it'll flop. And that's when I really take a hard look at myself and say: 'Well, that crowd is obviously wrong. That crowd has absolutely no idea what it's talking about.'",Aziz Ansari,aziz-ansari
What's cool about Twitter is that you can make a joke about something very of-the-moment or random that I wouldn't be able to joke about in stand-up.,Aziz Ansari,aziz-ansari

To decide to become a philosopher seemed as foolish to me as to decide to become a poet.,Karl Jaspers,karl-jaspers

Philosophy can only be approached with the most concrete comprehension.,Karl Jaspers,karl-jaspers
Philosophy is tested and characterised by the way in which it appropriates its history.,Karl Jaspers,karl-jaspers
Reason is like an open secret that can become known to anyone at any time; it is the quiet space into which everyone can enter through his own thought.,Karl Jaspers,karl-jaspers
The great philosophers and the great works are standards for the selection of what is essential. Everything that we do in studying the history of philosophy ultimately serves their better understanding.,Karl Jaspers,karl-jaspers

E. B. Du Bois,w-e-b-du-bois
"For the Negro, Andrew Johnson did less than nothing when once he realized that the chief beneficiary of labor and economic reform in the South would be freedmen.

Du Bois,w-e-b-du-bois
"Before and after emancipation, the Negro, in self-defense, was propelled toward the white employer.

"From the very first, it has been the educated and intelligent of the Negro people that have led and elevated the mass, and the sole obstacles that nullified and retarded their efforts were slavery and race prejudice; for what is slavery but the legalized survival of the unfit and the nullification of the work of natural internal leadership?",W. E. B. Du Bois,w-e-b-du-bois
"From the day of its birth, the anomaly of slavery plagued a nation which asserted the equality of all men, and sought to derive powers of government from the consent of the governed.

The world is the mirror of myself dying.,Henry Miller,henry-miller

One can be absolutely truthful and sincere even though admittedly the most outrageous liar. Fiction and invention are of the very fabric of life.,Henry Miller,henry-miller
"Art is only a means to life, to the life more abundant. It is not in itself the life more abundant. It merely points the way, something which is overlooked not only by the public, but very often by the artist himself. In becoming an end it defeats itself.",Henry Miller,henry-miller
Instead of asking 'How much damage will the work in question bring about?' why not ask 'How much good? How much joy?',Henry Miller,henry-miller
"The new always carries with it the sense of violation, of sacrilege. What is dead is sacred; what is new, that is different, is evil, dangerous, or subversive.",Henry Miller,henry-miller

Nothing is divine but what is agreeable to reason.,Immanuel Kant,immanuel-kant

Out of timber so crooked as that from which man is made nothing entirely straight can be carved.,Immanuel Kant,immanuel-kant
"All thought must, directly or indirectly, by way of certain characters, relate ultimately to intuitions, and therefore, with us, to sensibility, because in no other way can an object be given to us.",Immanuel Kant,immanuel-kant
"The only objects of practical reason are therefore those of good and evil. For by the former is meant an object necessarily desired according to a principle of reason; by the latter one necessarily shunned, also according to a principle of reason.",Immanuel Kant,immanuel-kant
"If I have seen further than others, it is by standing upon the shoulders of giants.",Isaac Newton,isaac-newton

"Gravity may put the planets into motion, but without the divine Power, it could never put them into such a circulating motion as they have about the Sun; and therefore, for this as well as other reasons, I am compelled to ascribe the frame of this System to an intelligent Agent.",Isaac Newton,isaac-newton

"The same law takes place in a system, consisting of many bodies, as in one single body, with regard to their persevering in their state of motion or of rest.

The Ignis Fatuus is a vapor shining without heat.,Isaac Newton,isaac-newton
"The same thing is to be understood of all bodies, revolved in any orbits.

"We all want to be famous people, and the moment we want to be something we are no longer free.",Jiddu Krishnamurti,jiddu-krishnamurti
"It is really very important while you are young to live in an environment in which there is no fear. Most of us, as we grow older, become frightened; we are afraid of living, afraid of losing a job, afraid of tradition, afraid of what the neighbours, or what the wife or husband would say, afraid of death.",Jiddu Krishnamurti,jiddu-krishnamurti
"We are second-hand people. We have lived on what we have been told, either guided by our inclinations, our tendencies, or compelled to accept by circumstances and environment. We are the result of all kinds of influences, and there is nothing new in us, nothing that we have discovered for ourselves: nothing original, pristine, clear.",Jiddu Krishnamurti,jiddu-krishnamurti
"What is needed, rather than running away or controlling or suppressing or any other resistance, is understanding fear; that means, watch it, learn about it, come directly into contact with it. We are to learn about fear, not how to escape from it.",Jiddu Krishnamurti,jiddu-krishnamurti
"In seeking comfort, we generally find a quiet corner in life where there is a minimum of conflict, and then we are afraid to step out of that seclusion.",Jiddu Krishnamurti,jiddu-krishnamurti
"With increasing age, dullness of mind and heart sets in.",Jiddu Krishnamurti,jiddu-krishnamurti
"You must understand the whole of life, not just one little part of it. That is why you must read, that is why you must look at the skies, that is why you must sing and dance, and write poems and suffer and understand, for all that is life.",Jiddu Krishnamurti,jiddu-krishnamurti
The constant assertion of belief is an indication of fear.,Jiddu Krishnamurti,jiddu-krishnamurti
"We are domesticated animals, revolving in a cage which we have built for ourselves - with its contentions, wranglings, its impossible political leaders, its gurus who exploit our self-conceit and their own with great refinement or rather crudely.",Jiddu Krishnamurti,jiddu-krishnamurti
Religion is the frozen thought of man out of which they build temples.,Jiddu Krishnamurti,jiddu-krishnamurti
"It is violence when we use a sharp word, when we make a gesture to brush away a person. So violence isn't merely organized butchery in the name of God, in the name of society or country. Violence is much more subtle, much deeper.",Jiddu Krishnamurti,jiddu-krishnamurti
Freedom from the desire for an answer is essential to the understanding of a problem.,Jiddu Krishnamurti,jiddu-krishnamurti
"A man who is not afraid is not aggressive, a man who has no sense of fear of any kind is really a free, a peaceful man.",Jiddu Krishnamurti,jiddu-krishnamurti
"Meditation is a state of mind which looks at everything with complete attention, totally, not just parts of it. And no one can teach you how to be attentive. If any system teaches you how to be attentive, then you are attentive to the system, and that is not attention.",Jiddu Krishnamurti,jiddu-krishnamurti
"If we depend for our happiness on another, on society or on environment, they become essential to us; we cling to them, and any alteration of these we violently oppose because we depend upon them for our psychological security and comfort.",Jiddu Krishnamurti,jiddu-krishnamurti
"No one can live without relationship. You may withdraw into the mountains, become a monk, a sannyasi, wander off into the desert by yourself, but you are related. You cannot escape from that absolute fact. You cannot exist in isolation.",Jiddu Krishnamurti,jiddu-krishnamurti
"Life is relationship, living is relationship. We cannot live if you and I have built a wall around ourselves and just peep over that wall occasionally. Unconsciously, deeply, under the wall, we are related.",Jiddu Krishnamurti,jiddu-krishnamurti
"Life cannot be without relationship, but we have made it so agonizing and hideous by basing it on personal and possessive love. Can one love and yet not possess? You will find the true answer not in escape, ideals, beliefs but through the understanding of the causes of dependence and possessiveness.",Jiddu Krishnamurti,jiddu-krishnamurti
"When I understand myself, I understand you, and out of that understanding comes love.",Jiddu Krishnamurti,jiddu-krishnamurti
"I maintain that Truth is a pathless land, and you cannot approach it by any path whatsoever, by any religion, by any sect.",Jiddu Krishnamurti,jiddu-krishnamurti
"When you draw or paint a tree, you do not imitate the tree; you do not copy it exactly as it is, which would be mere photography. To be free to paint a tree or a flower or a sunset, you have to feel what it conveys to you: the significance, the meaning of it.",Jiddu Krishnamurti,jiddu-krishnamurti
"For most of us, relationship with another is based on dependence, either economic or psychological. This dependence creates fear, breeds in us possessiveness, results in friction, suspicion, frustration.",Jiddu Krishnamurti,jiddu-krishnamurti
"If we could establish a deep abiding relationship with nature, we would never kill an animal for our appetite; we would never harm, vivisect, a monkey, a dog, a guinea pig for our benefit. We would find other ways to heal our wounds, heal our bodies.",Jiddu Krishnamurti,jiddu-krishnamurti
"We never look deeply into the quality of a tree; we never really touch it, feel its solidity, its rough bark, and hear the sound that is part of the tree. Not the sound of wind through the leaves, not the breeze of a morning that flutters the leaves, but its own sound, the sound of the trunk and the silent sound of the roots.",Jiddu Krishnamurti,jiddu-krishnamurti
"To live is to find out for yourself what is true, and you can do this only when there is freedom, when there is continuous revolution inwardly, within yourself.",Jiddu Krishnamurti,jiddu-krishnamurti
"If we can really understand the problem, the answer will come out of it, because the answer is not separate from the problem.",Jiddu Krishnamurti,jiddu-krishnamurti
Meditation is not following any system; it is not constant repetition and imitation. Meditation is not concentration.,Jiddu Krishnamurti,jiddu-krishnamurti
"It is odd that we have so little relationship with nature, with the insects and the leaping frog and the owl that hoots among the hills calling for its mate. We never seem to have a feeling for all living things on the earth.",Jiddu Krishnamurti,jiddu-krishnamurti
"The end is the beginning of all things, Suppressed and hidden, Awaiting to be released through the rhythm Of pain and pleasure.",Jiddu Krishnamurti,jiddu-krishnamurti
"Love is the missing factor; there is a lack of affection, of warmth in relationship; and because we lack that love, that tenderness, that generosity, that mercy in relationship, we escape into mass action, which produces further confusion, further misery.",Jiddu Krishnamurti,jiddu-krishnamurti
"Truth cannot be brought down; rather, the individual must make the effort to ascend to it. You cannot bring the mountaintop to the valley. If you would attain to the mountaintop, you must pass through the valley, climb the steeps, unafraid of the dangerous precipices.",Jiddu Krishnamurti,jiddu-krishnamurti
"All ideologies are idiotic, whether religious or political, for it is conceptual thinking, the conceptual word, which has so unfortunately divided man.",Jiddu Krishnamurti,jiddu-krishnamurti
"The question of whether or not there is a God or truth or reality or whatever you like to call it, can never be answered by books, by priests, philosopher's or saviours. Nobody and nothing can answer the question but you yourself, and that is why you must know yourself - Immaturity lies only in total ignorance of self.",Jiddu Krishnamurti,jiddu-krishnamurti
"So when you are listening to somebody, completely, attentively, then you are listening not only to the words, but also to the feeling of what is being conveyed, to the whole of it, not part of it.",Jiddu Krishnamurti,jiddu-krishnamurti
This is love: the flowering of love is meditation.,Jiddu Krishnamurti,jiddu-krishnamurti
Truth is a pathless land.,Jiddu Krishnamurti,jiddu-krishnamurti
"Man has throughout the ages been seeking something beyond himself, beyond material welfare - something we call truth or God or reality, a timeless state - something that cannot be disturbed by circumstances, by thought or by human corruption.",Jiddu Krishnamurti,jiddu-krishnamurti
"If you have fear, you are bound by tradition, you follow some leader or guru. When you are bound by tradition, when you are afraid of your husband or your wife, you lose your dignity as an individual human being.",Jiddu Krishnamurti,jiddu-krishnamurti
"A belief is purely an individual matter, and you cannot and must not organize it. If you do, it becomes dead, crystallized; it becomes a creed, a sect, a religion, to be imposed on others.",Jiddu Krishnamurti,jiddu-krishnamurti
"The movement of search can only be from the known to the known, and all that the mind can do is to be aware that this movement will never uncover the unknown. Any movement on the part of the known is still within the field of the known.",Jiddu Krishnamurti,jiddu-krishnamurti
"If one has fear, there can be no initiative in the creative sense of the word. To have initiative in this sense is to do something original - to do it spontaneously, naturally, without being guided, forced, controlled. It is to do something which you love to do.",Jiddu Krishnamurti,jiddu-krishnamurti
"A consistent thinker is a thoughtless person, because he conforms to a pattern; he repeats phrases and thinks in a groove.",Jiddu Krishnamurti,jiddu-krishnamurti
"All of us have been trained by education and environment to seek personal gain and security and to fight for ourselves. Though we cover it over with pleasant phrases, we have been educated for various professions within a system which is based on exploitation and acquisitive fear.",Jiddu Krishnamurti,jiddu-krishnamurti
"The environment that we call society is created by past generations; we accept it, as it helps us to maintain our greed, possessiveness, illusion.",Jiddu Krishnamurti,jiddu-krishnamurti
"Why does your mind conform? Have you ever asked? Are you aware that you are conforming to a pattern? It doesn't matter what that pattern is, whether you have established a pattern for yourself or it has been established for you.",Jiddu Krishnamurti,jiddu-krishnamurti
"When the mind is empty, silent, when it is in a state of complete negation - which is not blankness, nor the opposite of being positive, but a totally different state in which all thought has ceased - only then is it possible for that which is unnameable to come into being.",Jiddu Krishnamurti,jiddu-krishnamurti
"Have you ever asked yourselves what you are going to do when you grow up? In all likelihood you will get married, and before you know where you are, you will be mothers and fathers; and you will then be tied to a job, or to the kitchen, in which you will gradually wither away. Is that all that your life is going to be?",Jiddu Krishnamurti,jiddu-krishnamurti
"We do not know what love is. We know the symptoms of it, the pleasure, the pain, the fear, the anxiety and so on. We try to solve the symptoms, which becomes a wandering in darkness. We spend our days and nights in this, and it is soon over in death.",Jiddu Krishnamurti,jiddu-krishnamurti

"Part of the core information that I've been purveying is that identity politics is a sick game. You don't play racial, ethnic, and gender identity games.

I felt for a few good hours that I was falling.",Kalpana Chawla,kalpana-chawla

"I am waiting for the right story to tell. Just like 'Man of Tai Chi' just seemed to be the right story to tell. So I'm looking for that. Because I really love directing. I love developing the story.

I used to have nightmares that they would put 'He played Ted' on my tombstone.,Keanu Reeves,keanu-reeves

"Eventually, it came to this place like, 'I'd like to direct, but I need to find the story to tell.' 'Man of Tai Chi' became the story to tell.",Keanu Reeves,keanu-reeves
"Oftentimes, when we think of 3D, we think of things coming out of the screen, but actually, you've got this zero, this negative space, what they call the negative space, which is the scene, what's being filmed in the positive space of the audience.

"It's easy to become very self-critical when you're an actor. Then you get critiqued by the critics. Whether you agree with them or not, people are passing judgment on you.",Keanu Reeves,keanu-reeves

We're so trendy we can't even escape ourselves.,Kurt Cobain,kurt-cobain

I knew that when I had a child, I'd be overwhelmed, and it's true... I can't tell you how much my attitude has changed since we've got Frances. Holding my baby is the best drug in the world.",Kurt Cobain,kurt-cobain
I get a thrill meeting kids who are into alternative music.,Kurt Cobain,kurt-cobain
I wanted to have the adoration of John Lennon but have the anonymity of Ringo Starr. I didn't want to be a frontman. I just wanted to be back there and still be a rock and roll star at the same time.,Kurt Cobain,kurt-cobain
I'm a spokesman for myself. It just so happens that there's a bunch of people that are concerned with what I have to say. I find that frightening at times because I'm just as confused as most people. I don't have the answers for anything.,Kurt Cobain,kurt-cobain

"Ever since the beginning of rock and roll, there's been an Axl Rose. And it's just boring. It's totally boring to me.",Kurt Cobain,kurt-cobain
"I've had this terrible stomach problem for years, and that has made touring difficult. People would see me sitting in the corner by myself looking sick and gloomy.

"My body is damaged from music in two ways. I have a red irritation in my stomach. It's psychosomatic, caused by all the anger and the screaming.

"Pierre Curie came to see me and showed a simple and sincere sympathy with my student life. Soon he caught the habit of speaking to me of his dream of an existence consecrated entirely to scientific research, and he asked me to share that life.",Marie Curie,marie-curie
"The first experiments on the biological properties of radium were successfully made in France, with samples from our laboratory, while my husband was living.",Marie Curie,marie-curie

"It's destiny that pushed me towards showbiz. I wanted to start off as a technician, but out of compulsion, I became an actor.",Pawan Kalyan,pawan-kalyan
There is a latent talent in everyone. I am nothing extraordinary just because I happen to be an actor. Everybody is extraordinary in his own way.

The degree of freedom from unwanted thoughts and the degree of concentration on a single thought are the measures to gauge spiritual progress.,Ramana Maharshi,ramana-maharshi

"Time is only an idea. There is only the Reality. Whatever you think it is, it looks like that. If you call it time, it is time. If you call it existence, it is existence, and so on.

Suffering turns men towards their creator.,Ramana Maharshi,ramana-maharshi

Actions yield result by the ordinance of God as He wills.,Ramana Maharshi,ramana-maharshi
"Society is the body; individuals are its members, its limbs. Just as the various limbs help and co-operate with one another and thus are happy, so each must unite with others in being helpful to all in thought, speech and action... One may see to the good of one's own group, i.e., the group that is immediate to him, and then proceed to others.",Ramana Maharshi,ramana-maharshi
The best way to meditate is through meditation itself.,Ramana Maharshi,ramana-maharshi

God has no resolve; no karma attaches itself to Him.,Ramana Maharshi,ramana-maharshi
"The Self is self-luminous without darkness and light, and is the reality which is self-manifest. Therefore, one should not think of it as this or as that. The very thought of thinking will end in bondage.",Ramana Maharshi,ramana-maharshi
"Experiences such as, 'I went; I came; I was; I did,' come naturally to everyone. From these experiences, does it not appear that the consciousness 'I' is the subject of those various acts?

"You need not aspire for or get any new state. Get rid of your present thoughts, that is all.",Ramana Maharshi,ramana-maharshi
Consciousness is indeed always with us. Everyone knows 'I am!' No one can deny his own being.,Ramana Maharshi,ramana-maharshi

All activities and events that a body is to go through are determined at the time of conception.,Ramana Maharshi,ramana-maharshi
"As instruments for knowing the objects, the sense organs are outside, and so they are called outer senses; and the mind is called the inner sense because it is inside. But the distinction between inner and outer is only with reference to the body; in truth, there is neither inner nor outer. The mind's nature is to remain pure like ether.",Ramana Maharshi,ramana-maharshi
It is every intelligent man's experience that evildoing recoils on the doer sooner or later.,Ramana Maharshi,ramana-maharshi
"The means that make one qualified for enquiry are meditation, yoga, etc. One should gain proficiency in these through graded practice and thus secure a stream of mental modes that is natural and helpful.",Ramana Maharshi,ramana-maharshi

"My belief is that we were put into this world of wonders and beauty with a special ability to appreciate them, in some cases to have the fun of taking a hand in developing them, and also in being able to help other people instead of overreaching them and, through it all, to enjoy life - that is, to be happy.",Robert Baden-Powell,robert-baden-powell

"It is often useful, if an enemy happens to see you, to pretend that you have not seen him. Or it may sometimes be useful to pretend that you have other men with you.

"Technology is nothing. What's important is that you have a faith in people, that they're basically good and smart, and if you give them tools, they'll do wonderful things with them.",Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
"Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything - all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important.",Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
"If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on.",Steve Jobs,steve-jobs

"A lot of people in our industry haven't had very diverse experiences.

The broader one's understanding of the human experience, the better design we will have.",Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
Things don't have to change the world to be important.,Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
"No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there. And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life. It is Life's change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new.",Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
"Older people sit down and ask, 'What is it?' but the boy asks, 'What can I do with it?'.",Steve Jobs,steve-jobs

"It's not the tools that you have faith in - tools are just tools. They work, or they don't work. It's people you have faith in or not. Yeah, sure, I'm still optimistic I mean, I get pessimistic sometimes but not for long.",Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
"I didn't see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything.

We made the buttons on the screen look so good you'll want to lick them.,Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
Everyone here has the sense that right now is one of those moments when we are influencing the future.,Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
"When you're young, you look at television and think, there's a conspiracy. The networks have conspired to dumb us down. But when you get a little older, you realize that's not true. The networks are in business to give people exactly what they want.",Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
And one more thing.,Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
"We don't get a chance to do that many things, and every one should be really excellent. Because this is our life. Life is brief, and then you die, you know? So this is what we've chosen to do with our life.",Steve Jobs,steve-jobs

We're just enthusiastic about what we do.,Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
If you're gonna make connections which are innovative... you have to not have the same bag of experiences as everyone else does.,Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
"The system is that there is no system. That doesn't mean we don't have process. Apple is a very disciplined company, and we have great processes. But that's not what it's about. Process makes you more efficient.",Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
My biological mother later found out that my mother had never graduated from college and that my father had never graduated from high school. She refused to sign the final adoption papers. She only relented a few months later when my parents promised that I would someday go to college.,Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
Design is the fundamental soul of a man-made creation that ends up expressing itself in successive outer layers of the product or service. The iMac is not just the color or translucence or the shape of the shell. The essence of the iMac is to be the finest possible consumer computer in which each element plays together.,Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
"When you're a carpenter making a beautiful chest of drawers, you're not going to use a piece of plywood on the back, even though it faces the wall and nobody will ever see it. You'll know it's there, so you're going to use a beautiful piece of wood on the back.",Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
"Innovation has nothing to do with how many R & D dollars you have. When Apple came up with the Mac, IBM was spending at least 100 times more on R & D. It's not about money. It's about the people you have, how you're led, and how much you get it.",Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
"I have a great respect for incremental improvement, and I've done that sort of thing in my life, but I've always been attracted to the more revolutionary changes. I don't know why. Because they're harder. They're much more stressful emotionally. And you usually go through a period where everybody tells you that you've completely failed.",Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
"What is Apple, after all? Apple is about people who think 'outside the box,' people who want to use computers to help them change the world, to help them create things that make a difference, and not just to get a job done.",Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
My model for business is The Beatles: They were four guys that kept each others' negative tendencies in check; they balanced each other. And the total was greater than the sum of the parts.,Steve Jobs,steve-jobs

"I'm an optimist in the sense that I believe humans are noble and honorable, and some of them are really smart. I have a very optimistic view of individuals.",Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
"I was lucky - I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parents' garage when I was 20. We worked hard, and in 10 years, Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees.",Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
"And it comes from saying no to 1,000 things to make sure we don't get on the wrong track or try to do too much. We're always thinking about new markets we could enter, but it's only by saying no that you can concentrate on the things that are really important.",Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
"For you to sleep well at night, the aesthetic, the quality, has to be carried all the way through.",Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
We hire people who want to make the best things in the world.,Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
"As individuals, people are inherently good. I have a somewhat more pessimistic view of people in groups. And I remain extremely concerned when I see what's happening in our country, which is in many ways the luckiest place in the world.

"And no, we don't know where it will lead. We just know there's something much bigger than any of us here.",Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
I think money is a wonderful thing because it enables you to do things. It enables you to invest in ideas that don't have a short-term payback.,Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
"The over-all point is that new technology will not necessarily replace old technology, but it will date it. By definition. Eventually, it will replace it. But it's like people who had black-and-white TVs when color came out. They eventually decided whether or not the new technology was worth the investment.",Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
"A lot of companies have chosen to downsize, and maybe that was the right thing for them. We chose a different path. Our belief was that if we kept putting great products in front of customers, they would continue to open their wallets.",Steve Jobs,steve-jobs
The reason that Apple is able to create products like the iPad is because we've always tried to be at the intersection of technology and the liberal arts.,Steve Jobs,steve-jobs

"If you are far from the enemy, make him believe you are near.",Sun Tzu,sun-tzu
The general who wins the battle makes many calculations in his temple before the battle is fought. The general who loses makes but few calculations beforehand.,Sun Tzu,sun-tzu

"If ignorant both of your enemy and yourself, you are certain to be in peril.",Sun Tzu,sun-tzu
"The general who advances without coveting fame and retreats without fearing disgrace, whose only thought is to protect his country and do good service for his sovereign, is the jewel of the kingdom.",Sun Tzu,sun-tzu
The quality of decision is like the well-timed swoop of a falcon which enables it to strike and destroy its victim.,Sun Tzu,sun-tzu
"Confront them with annihilation, and they will then survive; plunge them into a deadly situation, and they will then live. When people fall into danger, they are then able to strive for victory.",Sun Tzu,sun-tzu

He will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout all its ranks.,Sun Tzu,sun-tzu
For to win one hundred victories in one hundred battles is not the acme of skill. To subdue the enemy without fighting is the acme of skill.,Sun Tzu,sun-tzu
Secret operations are essential in war; upon them the army relies to make its every move.,Sun Tzu,sun-tzu
"Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and you know yourself, your victory will not stand in doubt; if you know Heaven and you know Earth, you may make your victory complete.",Sun Tzu,sun-tzu
He will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior forces.,Sun Tzu,sun-tzu
Balk the enemy's power; force him to reveal himself.,Sun Tzu,sun-tzu
To see victory only when it is within the ken of the common herd is not the acme of excellence.,Sun Tzu,sun-tzu
There has never been a protracted war from which a country has benefited.,Sun Tzu,sun-tzu

"The enlightened ruler is heedful, and the good general full of caution.",Sun Tzu,sun-tzu
"When envoys are sent with compliments in their mouths, it is a sign that the enemy wishes for a truce.",Sun Tzu,sun-tzu
Now the reason the enlightened prince and the wise general conquer the enemy whenever they move and their achievements surpass those of ordinary men is foreknowledge.,Sun Tzu,sun-tzu
"Thus, what is of supreme importance in war is to attack the enemy's strategy.",Sun Tzu,sun-tzu
"For them to perceive the advantage of defeating the enemy, they must also have their rewards.",Sun Tzu,sun-tzu
"The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy.",Sun Tzu,sun-tzu
Hence that general is skilful in attack whose opponent does not know what to defend; and he is skilful in defense whose opponent does not know what to attack.,Sun Tzu,sun-tzu
It is essential to seek out enemy agents who have come to conduct espionage against you and to bribe them to serve you. Give them instructions and care for them. Thus doubled agents are recruited and used.,Sun Tzu,sun-tzu
Of all those in the army close to the commander none is more intimate than the secret agent; of all rewards none more liberal than those given to secret agents; of all matters none is more confidential than those relating to secret operations.,Sun Tzu,sun-tzu
"If we know that our own men are in a condition to attack, but are unaware that the enemy is not open to attack, we have gone only halfway towards victory.",Sun Tzu,sun-tzu

"I might not be over-enthusiastic about socialising and making friends, but I am not a loner. I love hanging out with my friends, and I do it often when I am not working.

I wanted to be a cricketer. But I was not skilled enough to be a national-level cricketer.,Sushant Singh Rajput,sushant-singh-rajput
"I have seen extreme lows because of factors that were not in my hands - be it not having money to buy my first bike, dropping out of a prestigious engineering college without having a single rupee in my bank account, living with seven boys in a single-room kitchen in Mumbai, or eating nothing but khichdi every day.

"I have songs that define characters from each film of mine. It can be a song from that particular film or something that just goes with the wavelength of the film; you listen to it, and it gives you that rhythm.

"My exercise regime is a mix of gymming, marital arts, sports, etc.",Sushant Singh Rajput,sushant-singh-rajput

"I love soccer, love tennis... Roger Federer has been a favourite for a long, long time. The kind of consistency he has shown, 16 Grand Slam titles...

I like watching Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi and David Villa.",Virat Kohli,virat-kohli
"Music, for me, is vital. Punjabi, Bollywood, Sufi, RnB... I listen to it all. When I'm not listening to music, you will find me chatting with friends.

"Endorsements are a reward for good performance on the field, and the commitments made after signing them need to be done.",Virat Kohli,virat-kohli
"I love tattoos. And mine symbolise who I really am. I have a Samurai on my left arm. At a subconscious level, I connect to this warrior and model myself on his discipline, skills and honour. There is also a tribal tattoo and a Chinese symbol of faith. I have seen a lot of people getting tattoos just because it's a trend.",Virat Kohli,virat-kohli
"I always had a sense of discipline in me. However, there was a time when I couldn't divide my time properly between off-field things and on-field assignments. The focus would be missing at times, and that would affect my preparation for matches. I managed to change that.",Virat Kohli,virat-kohli
"I feel really blessed when people start comparing me with Sachin, but I keep myself focused on my performance and not on such comparisons. I literally worship him, so I don't see too much in this comparison. No cricketer has been able to score one hundred centuries like Sachin.",Virat Kohli,virat-kohli

I want to elongate my cricketing career as a consistent player. I have personal goals I would like to achieve someday.,Virat Kohli,virat-kohli

"A lot of people tell me a lot of things about my conduct, my game, my future... but I try to stay away from their words of wisdom. I don't let it distract me. On the field, you will be facing the ball alone. If you fail, you will the only one to blame. So, you should be the one deciding for yourself.",Virat Kohli,virat-kohli
"I get really motivated when I put on the India jersey. It is a responsibility, so I want to perform in the best way I can.",Virat Kohli,virat-kohli
"I've never fought with anyone. A lot of people talk to me, and they're like, 'Oh, you would have been fighting all the time when you were younger,' but I'm like, 'I never fought with anyone because I always knew that if I hurt myself, I might lose important time in my cricket career,' so I never got into any fight, ever in my life.",Virat Kohli,virat-kohli
"Unless someone wants to look funny, I'll not recommend anyone to copy my bowling action. But on a serious note, with the confidence that I have got from the amount of runs I have been scoring, when I'm thrown the ball to bowl, I am pretty sure of what I have to do. I may not be the most attractive to watch while bowling, but I can be effective.",Virat Kohli,virat-kohli
"My focus had always been the on-side. My coach wanted me to work on the offside strokes since he was convinced of my ability and timing on the leg side. I worked hard and firmed up my defensive technique. I am happy getting runs all around the wicket now, and getting a lot of boundaries. No one calls me a 'leggie batsman' anymore.",Virat Kohli,virat-kohli
